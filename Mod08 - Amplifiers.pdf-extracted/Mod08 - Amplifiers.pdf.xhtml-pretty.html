SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current
(dc). It also describes some of the general safety precautions and first-aid procedures that should be

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-1-1-">INTRODUCTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">This chapter is a milestone in your study of electronics. Previous modules have been concerned more 
with individual components of circuits than with the complete circuits as the subject. This chapter and the 
other chapters of this module are concerned with the circuitry of amplifiers. While components are 
discussed, the discussion of the components is not an explanation of the working of the component itself 
(these have been covered in previous modules) but an explanation of the component as it relates to the 
circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuits this chapter is concerned with are AMPLIFIERS. Amplifiers are devices that provide 
AMPLIFICATION. That doesn't explain much, but it does describe an amplifier if you know what 
amplification is and what it is used for. 
</p><p class="paragraph">WHAT IS AMPLIFICATION? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Just as an amplifier is a device that provides amplification, amplification is the process of providing 
an increase in AMPLITUDE. Amplitude is a term that describes the size of a signal. In terms of a.c., 
amplitude usually refers to the amount of voltage or current. A 5-volt peak-to-peak a.c.signal would be 
larger in amplitude than a 4-volt peak-to-peak a.c. signal. "SIGNAL" is a general term used to refer to any 
a.c. or d.c. of interest in a circuit; e.g., input signal and output signal. A signal can be large or small, ac. or 
d.c., a sine wave or nonsinusoidal, or even nonelectrical such as sound or light. "Signal" is a very general 
term and, therefore, not very descriptive by itself, but it does sound more technical than the word "thing". 
It is not very impressive to refer to the "input thing" or the "thing that comes out of this circuit." </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Perhaps the concept of the relationship of amplifier-amplification-amplitude will be clearer if you 
consider a parallel situation (an analogy). A magnifying glass is a magnifier. As such, it provides 
magnification which is an increase in the magnitude (size) of an object. This relationship of magnifier-
magnification-magnitude is the same as the relationship of amplifier-amplification-amplitude. The 
analogy is true in one other aspect as well. The magnifier does not change the object that is being 
magnified; it is only the image that is larger, not the object itself. With the amplifier, the output signal 
differs in amplitude from the input signal, but the input signal still exists unchanged. So, the object (input 
signal) and the magnifier (amplifier) control the image (output signal). 
</p><p class="paragraph">An amplifier can be defined as a device that enables an input signal to control an output signal. The 
output signal will have some (or all) of the characteristics of the input signal but will generally be larger 
than the input signal in terms of voltage, current, or power. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-USES-OF-AMPLIFICATION-1-2-">USES OF AMPLIFICATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Most electronic devices use amplifiers to provide various amounts of signal amplification. Since 
most signals are originally too small to control or drive the desired device, some amplification is needed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, the audio signal taken from a record is too small to drive a speaker, so amplification is 
needed. The signal will be amplified several times between the needle of the record player and the 
speaker. Each time the signal is amplified it is said to go through a STAGE of amplification. The audio 
amplifier shown connected between the turntable and speaker system in figure 1-1 contains several stages 
of amplification. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice the triangle used in figure 1-1 to represent the amplifier. This triangle is the standard block 
diagram symbol for an amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another example of the use of an amplifier is shown in figure 1-2. In a radio receiver, the signal 
picked up by the antenna is too weak (small) to be used as it is. This signal must be amplified before it is 
sent to the detector. (The detector separates the audio signal from the frequency that was sent by the 
transmitter. The way in which this is done will be discussed later in this training series.) </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Almost every electronic device contains at least one stage of amplification, so you will be seeing 
amplifiers in many devices that you work on. Amplifiers will also be used in most of the NEETS modules 
that follow this one.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Most electronic devices use at least one amplifier, but there are many types of amplifiers. This 
module will not try to describe all the different types of amplifiers. You will be shown the general 
principles of amplifiers and some typical amplifier circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most amplifiers can be classified in two ways. The first classification is by their function. This 
means they are basically voltage amplifiers or power amplifiers. The second classification is by their 
frequency response. In other words what frequencies are they designed to amplify? 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you describe an amplifier by these two classifications (function and frequency response) you will 
have a good working description of the amplifier. You may not know what the exact circuitry is, but you 
will know what the amplifier does and the frequencies that it is designed to handle.

power amplifiers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A VOLTAGE AMPLIFIER is an amplifier in which the output signal voltage is larger than the input 
signal voltage. In other words, a voltage amplifier amplifies the voltage of the input signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A POWER AMPLIFIER is an amplifier in which the output signal power is greater than the input 
signal power. In other words, a power amplifier amplifies the power of the input signal. Most power 
amplifiers are used as the final amplifier (stage of amplification) and control (or drive) the output device. 
The output device could be a speaker, an indicating device, an antenna, or the heads on a tape recorder. 
Whatever the device, the power to make it work (or drive it) comes from the final stage of amplification 
which is a power amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-3 shows a simple block diagram of a voltage amplifier with its input and output signals and 
a power amplifier with its input and output signals. Notice that in view (A) the output signal voltage is 
larger than the input signal voltage. Since the current values for the input and output signals are not 
shown, you cannot tell if there is a power gain in addition to the voltage gain. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">In view (B) of the figure the output signal voltage is less than the input signal voltage. As a voltage 
amplifier, this circuit has a gain of less than 1. The output power, however, is greater than the input 
power. Therefore, this circuit is a power amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The classification of an amplifier as a voltage or power amplifier is made by comparing the 
characteristics of the input and output signals. If the output signal is larger in voltage amplitude than the 
input signal, the amplifier is a voltage amplifier. If there is no voltage gain, but the output power is greater 
than the input power, the amplifier is a power amplifier. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FREQUENCY-RESPONSE-OF-AMPLIFIERS-1-5-">FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF AMPLIFIERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In addition to being classified by function, amplifiers are classified by frequency response. The 
frequency response of an amplifier refers to the band of frequencies or frequency range that the amplifier 
was designed to amplify. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You may wonder why the frequency response is important. Why doesn't an amplifier designed to 
amplify a signal of 1000 Hz work just as well at 1000 MHz? The answer is that the components of the 
amplifier respond differently at different frequencies. The amplifying device (electron tube, transistor, 
magnetic amplifier, etc.) itself will have frequency limitations and respond in different ways as the 
frequency changes. Capacitors and inductors in the circuit will change their reactance as the frequency 
changes. Even the slight amounts of capacitance and inductance between the circuit wiring and other 
components (interelectrode capacitance and self-inductance) can become significant at high frequencies. 
Since the response of components varies with the frequency, the components of an amplifier are selected 
to amplify a certain range or band of frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: For explanations of interelectrode capacitance and self-inductance see NEETS Modules 2—
Introduction to Alternating Current and Transformers; 6—Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes, 
and Power Supplies; and 7—Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The three broad categories of frequency response for amplifiers are AUDIO AMPLIFIER, RF 
AMPLIFIER, and VIDEO AMPLIFIER. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An audio amplifier is designed to amplify frequencies between 15 Hz and 20 kHz. Any amplifier that 
is designed for this entire band of frequencies or any band of frequencies contained in the audio range is 
considered to be an audio amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the term rf amplifier, the "rf" stands for radio frequency. These amplifiers are designed to amplify 
frequencies between 10 kHz and 100,000 MHz. A single amplifier will not amplify the entire rf range, but 
any amplifier whose frequency band is included in the rf range is considered an rf amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A video amplifier is an amplifier designed to amplify a band of frequencies from 10 Hz to 6 MHz. 
Because this is such a wide band of frequencies, these amplifiers are sometimes called WIDE-BAND 
AMPLIFIERS. While a video amplifier will amplify a very wide band of frequencies, it does not have the 
gain of narrower-band amplifiers. It also requires a great many more components than a narrow-band 
amplifier to enable it to amplify a wide range of frequencies.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A transistor amplifier is a current-control device. The current in the base of the transistor (which is 
dependent on the emitter-base bias) controls the current in the collector. A vacuum-tube amplifier is also 
a current-control device. The grid bias controls the plate current. These facts are expanded upon in 
NEETS Module 6, Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes and Power Supplies, and Module 7,

</p><p class="paragraph">You might hear that a vacuum tube is a voltage-operated device (since the grid does not need to draw 
current) while the transistor is a current-operated device. You might agree with this statement, but both 
the vacuum tube and the transistor are still current-control devices. The whole secret to understanding 
amplifiers is to remember that fact. Current control is the name of the game. Once current is controlled 
you can use it to give you a voltage gain or a power gain. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This chapter will use transistor amplifiers to present the concepts and principles of amplifiers. These 
concepts apply to vacuum-tube amplifiers and, in most cases, magnetic amplifiers as well as transistor 
amplifiers. If you wish to study the vacuum-tube equivalent circuits of the transistor circuits presented, an 
excellent source is the EIMB, NAVSEA 0967-LP-000-0120, Electronics Circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The first amplifier concept that is discussed is the "class of operation" of an amplifier. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-AMPLIFIER-CLASSES-OF-OPERATION-1-6-">AMPLIFIER CLASSES OF OPERATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The class of operation of an amplifier is determined by the amount of time (in relation to the input 
signal) that current flows in the output circuit. This is a function of the operating point of the amplifying 
device. The operating point of the amplifying device is determined by the bias applied to the device. 
There are four classes of operation for an amplifier. These are: A, AB, B and C. Each class of operation 
has certain uses and characteristics. No one class of operation is "better" than any other class. The 
selection of the "best" class of operation is determined by the use of the amplifying circuit. The best class 
of operation for a phonograph is not the best class for a radio transmitter. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Class A Operation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A simple transistor amplifier that is operated class A is shown in figure 1-4. Since the output signal 
is a 100% (or 360º) copy of the input signal, current in the output circuit must flow for 100% of the input 
signal time. This is the definition of a class A amplifier. Amplifier current flows for 100% of the input 
signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The class A amplifier has the characteristics of good FIDELITY and low EFFICIENCY. Fidelity 
means that the output signal is just like the input signal in all respects except amplitude. It has the same </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">shape and frequency. In some cases, there may be a phase difference between the input and output signal 
(usually 180º), but the signals are still considered to be "good copies." If the output signal is not like the 
input signal in shape or frequency, the signal is said to be DISTORTED. DISTORTION is any undesired 
change in a signal from input to output. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The efficiency of an amplifier refers to the amount of power delivered to the output compared to the 
power supplied to the circuit. Since every device takes power to operate, if the amplifier operates for 360º 
of input signal, it uses more power than if it only operates for 180º of input signal. If the amplifier uses 
more power, less power is available for the output signal and efficiency is lower. Since class A amplifiers 
operate (have current flow) for 360º of input signal, they are low in efficiency. This low efficiency is 
acceptable in class A amplifiers because they are used where efficiency is not as important as fidelity. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Class AB Operation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">If the amplifying device is biased in such a way that current flows in the device for 51% - 99% of the 
input signal, the amplifier is operating class AB. A simple class AB amplifier is shown in figure 1-5. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that the output signal is distorted. The output signal no longer has the same shape as the input 
signal. The portion of the output signal that appears to be cut off is caused by the lack of current through 
the transistor. When the emitter becomes positive enough, the transistor cannot conduct because the base-
to-emitter junction is no longer forward biased. Any further increase in input signal will not cause an 
increase in output signal voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Class AB amplifiers have better efficiency and poorer fidelity than class A amplifiers. They are used 
when the output signal need not be a complete reproduction of the input signal, but both positive and 
negative portions of the input signal must be available at the output. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Class AB amplifiers are usually defined as amplifiers operating between class A and class B because 
class A amplifiers operate on 100% of input signal and class B amplifiers (discussed next) operate on 
50% of the input signal. Any amplifier operating between these two limits is operating class AB. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Class B Operation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">As was stated above, a class B amplifier operates for 50% of the input signal. A simple class B 
amplifier is shown in figure 1-6. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the circuit shown in figure 1-6, the base-emitter bias will not allow the transistor to conduct 
whenever the input signal becomes positive. Therefore, only the negative portion of the input signal is 
reproduced in the output signal. You may wonder why a class B amplifier would be used instead of a 
simple rectifier if only half the input signal is desired in the output. The answer to this is that the rectifier 
does not amplify. The output signal of a rectifier cannot be higher in amplitude than the input signal. The 
class B amplifier not only reproduces half the input signal, but amplifies it as well. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Class B amplifiers are twice as efficient as class A amplifiers since the amplifying device only 
conducts (and uses power) for half of the input signal. A class B amplifier is used in cases where exactly 
50% of the input signal must be amplified. If less than 50% of the input signal is needed, a class C 
amplifier is used. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Class C Operation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-7 shows a simple class C amplifier. Notice that only a small portion of the input signal is 
present in the output signal. Since the transistor does not conduct except during a small portion of the 
input signal, this is the most efficient amplifier. It also has the worst fidelity. The output signal bears very 
little resemblance to the input signal. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

amplification. Many devices contain several stages of amplification and therefore several amplifiers. 
Stages of amplification are added when a single stage will not provide the required amount of 
amplification. For example, if a single stage of amplification will provide a maximum gain of 100 and the 
desired gain from the device is 1000, two stages of amplification will be required. The two stages might 
have gains of 10 and 100, 20 and 50, or 25 and 40. (The overall gain is the product of the individual 
stages-10 × 100 = 20 × 50 = 25 × 40 = 1000.)

devices (top view, figure 1-8), there must be some way for the signal to enter and leave the amplifier. The 
process of transferring energy between circuits is known as COUPLING. There are various ways of 
coupling signals into and out of amplifier circuits. The following is a description of some of the more 
common methods of amplifier coupling. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Direct Coupling 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The method of coupling that uses the least number of circuit elements and that is, perhaps, the easiest 
to understand is direct coupling. In direct coupling the output of one stage is connected directly to the 
input of the following stage. Figure 1-9 shows two direct-coupled transistor amplifiers. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

of R4, R5, and R6 is a voltage divider used to provide the bias and operating voltages for Q1 and Q2. The 
entire circuit provides two stages of amplification. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Direct coupling provides a good frequency response since no frequency-sensitive components 
(inductors and capacitors) are used. The frequency response of a circuit using direct coupling is affected 
only by the amplifying device itself. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Direct coupling has several disadvantages, however. The major problem is the power supply 
requirements for direct-coupled amplifiers. Each succeeding stage requires a higher voltage. The load and 
voltage divider resistors use a large amount of power and the biasing can become very complicated. In 
addition, it is difficult to match the impedance from stage to stage with direct coupling. (Impedance 
matching is covered a little later in this chapter.) 
</p><p class="paragraph">The direct-coupled amplifier is not very efficient and the losses increase as the number of stages 
increase. Because of the disadvantages, direct coupling is not used very often.

</p><p class="paragraph">R1 acts as a load resistor for Q1 (the first stage) and develops the output signal of that stage. Do you 
remember how a capacitor reacts to ac and dc? The capacitor, C1, "blocks" the dc of Q1's collector, but 
"passes" the ac output signal. R2 develops this passed, or coupled, signal as the input signal to Q2 (the 
second stage). This arrangement allows the coupling of the signal while it isolates the biasing of each 
stage. This solves many of the problems associated with direct coupling. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RC coupling does have a few disadvantages. The resistors use dc power and so the amplifier has low 
efficiency. The capacitor tends to limit the low-frequency response of the amplifier and the amplifying 
device itself limits the high-frequency response. For audio amplifiers this is usually not a problem; 
techniques for overcoming these frequency limitations will be covered later in this module. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before you move on to the next type of coupling, consider the capacitor in the RC coupling. You 
probably remember that capacitive reactance (X C) is determined by the following formula: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">This explains why the low frequencies are limited by the capacitor. As frequency decreases, XC 
increases. This causes more of the signal to be "lost" in the capacitor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The formula for XC also shows that the value of capacitance (C) should be relatively high so that 
capacitive reactance (XC) can be kept as low as possible. So, when a capacitor is used as a coupling 
element, the capacitance should be relatively high so that it will couple the entire signal well and not 
reduce or distort the signal. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Impedance Coupling 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Impedance coupling is very similar to RC coupling. The difference is the use of an impedance device 
(a coil) to replace the load resistor of the first stage. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-11 shows an impedance-coupling network between two stages of amplification. L1 is the 
load for Q1 and develops the output signal of the first stage. Since the d.c. resistance of a coil is low, the 
efficiency of the amplifier stage is increased. The amount of signal developed in the output of the stage 
depends on the inductive reactance of L1. Remember the formula for inductive reactance: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The formula shows that for inductive reactance to be large, either inductance or frequency or both 
must be high. Therefore, load inductors should have relatively large amounts of inductance and are most 
effective at high frequencies. This explains why impedance coupling is usually not used for audio 
amplifiers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The rest of the coupling network (C1 and R1) functions just as their counterparts (C1 and R2) in the 
RC-coupling network. C1 couples the signal between stages while blocking the d.c. and R1 develops the

primary of T1 acts as the load for the first stage (Q1) and the secondary of T1 acts as the developing 
impedance for the second stage (Q2). No capacitor is needed because transformer action couples the

</h2><p class="paragraph">It has been mentioned that efficiency and impedance are important in amplifiers. The reasons for this 
may not be too clear. You have been shown that any amplifier is a current-control device. Now there are 
two other principles you should try to keep in mind. First, there is no such thing as "something for 
nothing" in electronics. That means every time you do something to a signal it costs something. It might 
mean a loss in fidelity to get high power. Some other compromise might also be made when a circuit is 
designed. Regardless of the compromise, every stage will require and use power. This brings up the 
second principle-do things as efficiently as possible. The improvement and design of electronic circuits is 
an attempt to do things as cheaply as possible, in terms of power, when all the other requirements 
(fidelity, power output, frequency range, etc.) have been met. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This brings us to efficiency. The most efficient device is the one that does the job with the least loss 
of power. One of the largest losses of power is caused by impedance differences between the output of 
one circuit and the input of the next circuit. Perhaps the best way to think of an impedance difference 
(mismatch) between circuits is to think of different-sized water pipes. If you try to connect a one-inch 
water pipe to a two-inch water pipe without an adapter you will lose water. You must use an adapter. A </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

source (ES) whose output impedance is represented by a resistor (R1). It can be considered as an a.c. 
source because the output signal is an a.c. voltage and comes from circuit number 1 through the output 
impedance. The input impedance of circuit number 2 is represented by a resistor in series with the source. 
The resistance is shown as variable to show what will happen as the input impedance of circuit number 2

</h3><p class="paragraph">Now that you have seen the importance of impedance matching the stages in an electronic device, 
you may wonder what impedance characteristics an amplifier has. The input and output impedances of a 
transistor amplifier depend upon the configuration of the transistor. In Module 7, Introduction to 
Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, you were introduced to the three transistor configurations; the 
common emitter, the common base, and the common collector. Examples of these configurations and 
their impedance characteristics are shown in figure 1-14. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: Only approximate impedance values are shown. This is because the exact impedance values

</h2><p class="paragraph">Perhaps you have been around a public address system when a squeal or high-pitched noise has 
come from the speaker. Someone will turn down the volume and the noise will stop. That noise is an 
indication that the amplifier (at least one stage of amplification) has begun oscillating. Oscillation is 
covered in detail in NEETS Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits. For 
now, you need only realize that the oscillation is caused by a small part of the signal from the amplifier 
output being sent back to the input of the amplifier. This signal is amplified and again sent back to the 
input where it is amplified again. This process continues and the result is a loud noise out of the speaker. 
The process of sending part of the output signal of an amplifier back to the input of the amplifier is called 
FEEDBACK. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two types of feedback in amplifiers. They are POSITIVE FEEDBACK, also called 
REGENERATIVE FEEDBACK, and NEGATIVE FEEDBACK, also called DEGENERATIVE 
FEEDBACK. The difference between these two types is whether the feedback signal is in phase or out of 
phase with the input signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Positive feedback occurs when the feedback signal is in phase with the input signal. Figure 1-15 
shows a block diagram of an amplifier with positive feedback. Notice that the feedback signal is in phase 
with the input signal. This means that the feedback signal will add to or "regenerate" the input signal. The 
result is a larger amplitude output signal than would occur without the feedback. This type of feedback is 
what causes the public address system to squeal as described above. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-16 is a block diagram of an amplifier with negative feedback. In this case, the feedback 
signal is out of phase with the input signal. This means that the feedback signal will subtract from or 
"degenerate" the input signal. This results in a lower amplitude output signal than would occur without 
the feedback. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Sometimes feedback that is not desired occurs in an amplifier. This happens at high frequencies and 
limits the high-frequency response of an amplifier. Unwanted feedback also occurs as the result of some 
circuit components used in the biasing or coupling network. The usual solution to unwanted feedback is a 
feedback network of the opposite type. For example, a positive feedback network would counteract 
unwanted, negative feedback. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Feedback is also used to get the ideal input signal. Normally, the maximum output signal is desired 
from an amplifier. The amount of the output signal from an amplifier is dependent on the amount of the 
input signal. However, if the input signal is too large, the amplifying device will be saturated and/or cut 
off during part of the input signal. This causes the output signal to be distorted and reduces the fidelity of 
the amplifier. Amplifiers must provide the proper balance of gain and fidelity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-17 shows the way in which feedback can be used to provide the maximum output signal 
without a loss in fidelity. In view A, an amplifier has good fidelity, but less gain than it could have. By 
adding some positive feedback, as in view B, the gain of the stage is increased. In view C, an amplifier 
has so much gain and such a large input signal that the output signal is distorted. This distortion is caused 
by the amplifying device becoming saturated and cutoff. By adding a negative feedback system, as in 
view D, the gain of the stage is decreased and the fidelity of the output signal improved.

</p><p class="paragraph">The feedback network in this amplifier is made up of R2 and C2. The value of C2 should be large so 
that the capacitive reactance (X C) will be low and the capacitor will couple the signal easily. (This is also 
the case with the input and output coupling capacitors C1 and C3.) The resistive value of R2 should be 
large to limit the amount of feedback signal and to ensure that the majority of the output signal goes on to 
the next stage through C3. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A more common configuration for transistor amplifiers is the common-emitter configuration. 
Positive feedback is a little more difficult with this configuration because the input and output signals are 
180º out of phase. Positive feedback can be accomplished by feeding a portion of the output signal of the 
second stage back to the input of the first stage. This arrangement is shown in figure 1-19. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The figure shows that each stage of amplification has a 180º phase shift. This means that the output 
signal of Q2 will be in phase with the input signal to Q1. A portion of the output signal of Q2 is coupled 
back to the input of Q1 through the feedback network of C3 and R3. R3 should have a large resistance to 
limit the amount of signal through the feedback network. C3 should have a large capacitance so the 
capacitive reactance is low and the capacitor will couple the signal easily. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Sometimes positive feedback is used to eliminate the effects of negative feedback that are caused by 
circuit components. One way in which a circuit component can cause negative feedback is shown in 
figure 1-20. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In view (A) a common-emitter transistor amplifier is shown. An emitter resistor (R2) has been 
placed in this circuit to provide proper biasing and temperature stability. An undesired effect of this 
resistor is the development of a signal at the emitter in phase with the input signal on the base. This signal 
is caused by the changing current through the emitter resistor (R2) as the current through the transistor 
changes. You might think that this signal on the emitter is a form of positive feedback since it is in phase 
with the input signal. But the emitter signal is really negative feedback. Current through the transistor is 
controlled by the base-to-emitter bias. If both the base and emitter become more positive by the same 
amount at the same time, current will not increase. It is the difference between the base and emitter 
voltages that controls the current flow through the transistor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To eliminate this negative feedback caused by the emitter resistor, some way must be found to 
remove the signal from the emitter. If the signal could be coupled to ground (decoupled) the emitter of the 
transistor would be unaffected. That is exactly what is done. A DECOUPLING CAPACITOR (C3 in 
view B) is placed between the emitter of Q1 and ground (across the emitter resistor). This capacitor 
should have a high capacitance so that it will pass the signal to ground easily. The decoupling capacitor 
(C3) should have the same qualities as the coupling capacitors (C1 and C2) of the circuit. Decoupling 
capacitors are also called bypass capacitors. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">An audio amplifier has been described as an amplifier with a frequency response from 15 Hz to 20 
kHz. The frequency response of an amplifier can be shown graphically with a frequency response curve. 
Figure 1-22 is the ideal frequency response curve for an audio amplifier. This curve is practically "flat" 
from 15 Hz to 20 kHz. This means that the gain of the amplifier is equal between 15 Hz and 20 kHz. 
Above 20 kHz or below 15 Hz the gain decreases or "drops off" quite rapidly. The frequency response of 
an amplifier is determined by the components in the circuit. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

amplifier. In the next chapter of this module you will be shown the techniques and components used to 
change and extend the frequency response of an amplifier.

common-emitter, RC-coupled, transistor, audio amplifier. C1 is a coupling capacitor that couples the 
input signal to the base of Q1. R1 is used to develop the input signal and provide bias for the base of Q1. 
R2 is used to bias the emitter and provide temperature stability for Q1. C2 is used to provide decoupling 
(positive feedback) of the signal that would be developed by R2. R3 is the collector load for Q1 and 
develops the output signal. C3 is a coupling capacitor that couples the output signal to the next stage. VCC 
represents the collector-supply voltage. Since the transistor is a common-emitter configuration, it provides 
voltage amplification. The input and output signals are 180º out of phase. The input and output impedance 
are both medium. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Sometimes it is necessary to provide two signals that are equal in amplitude but 180º out of phase 
with each other. (You will see one use of these two signals a little later in this chapter.) The two signals 
can be provided from a single input signal by the use of a PHASE SPLITTER. A phase splitter is a device 
that produces two signals that differ in phase from each other from a single input signal. Figure 1-26 is a 
block diagram of a phase splitter. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">One way in which a phase splitter can be made is to use a center-tapped transformer. As you may 
remember from your study of transformers, when the transformer secondary winding is center-tapped, 
two equal amplitude signals are produced. These signals will be 180º out of phase with each other. So a 
transformer with a center-tapped secondary fulfills the definition of a phase splitter. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

in figure 1-27. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">C1 is the input signal coupling capacitor and couples the input signal to the base of Q1. R1 develops 
the input signal. R2 and R3 develop the output signals. R2 and R3 are equal resistances to provide equal 
amplitude output signals. C2 and C3 couple the output signals to the next stage. R4 is used to provide 
proper bias for the base of Q1. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This phase splitter is actually a single transistor combining the qualities of the common-emitter and 
common-collector configurations. The output signals are equal in amplitude of the input signal, but are 
180º out of phase from each other. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the output signals must be larger in amplitude than the input signal, a circuit such as that shown in 
figure 1-28 will be used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-28 shows a two-stage phase splitter. C1 couples the input signal to the base of Q1. R1 
develops the input signal and provides bias for the base of Q1. R2 provides bias and temperature stability 
for Q1. C2 decouples signals from the emitter of Q1. R3 develops the output signal of Q1. Since Q1 is 
configured as a common-emitter amplifier, the output signal of Q1 is 180º out of phase with the input 
signal and larger in amplitude. C3 couples this output signal to the next stage through R4. R4 allows only 
a small portion of this output signal to be applied to the base of Q2. R5 develops the input signal and 
provides bias for the base of Q2. R6 is used for bias and temperature stability for Q2. C4 decouples 
signals from the emitter of Q2. R7 develops the output signal from Q2. Q2 is configured as a 
common-emitter amplifier, so the output signal is 180º out of phase with the input signal to Q2 (output 
signal from Q1). The input signal to Q2 is 180º out of phase with the original input signal, so the output 
from Q2 is in phase with the original input signal. C5 couples this output signal to the next stage. So the 
circuitry shown provides two output signals that are 180º out of phase with each other. The output signals 
are equal in amplitude with each other but larger than the input signal. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

transistors. These transistors are configured in such a way that the two outputs, 180º out of phase with 
each other, combine. This allows more gain than one transistor could supply by itself. This "push-pull" 
amplifier is used where high power output and good fidelity are needed: receiver output stages, public 
address amplifiers, and AM modulators, for example. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit shown in figure 1-29 is a class A transistor push-pull amplifier, but class AB or class B 
operations can be used. Class operations were discussed in an earlier topic. The phase splitter for this 
amplifier is the transformer T1, although one of the phase splitters shown earlier in this topic could be 
used. R1 provides the proper bias for Q1 and Q2. The tapped secondary of T1 develops the two input 
signals for the bases of Q1 and Q2. Half of the original input signal will be amplified by Q-1, the other 
half by Q-2. T2 combines (couples) the amplified output signal to the speaker and provides impedance 
matching.

</p><p class="paragraph">Amplifiers are classified by FUNCTION and FREQUENCY RESPONSE. Function refers to an 
amplifier being a VOLTAGE AMPLIFIER or a POWER AMPLIFIER. Voltage amplifiers provide 
voltage amplification and power amplifiers provide power amplification. The frequency response of an 
amplifier can be described by classifying the amplifier as an AUDIO AMPLIFIER, RF AMPLIFIER, or 
VIDEO (WIDE-BAND) AMPLIFIER. Audio amplifiers have frequency response in the range of 15 Hz to 
20 kHz. An rf amplifier has a frequency response in the range of 10 kHz to 100,000 MHz. A video

specific information on video and rf amplifiers. For all practical purposes, all the general information you
studied in chapter 1 about audio amplifiers will apply to the video and rf amplifiers which you are about
to study.
</p><p class="paragraph">You may be wondering why you need to learn about video and rf amplifiers. You need to understand
these circuits because, as a technician, you will probably be involved in working on equipment in which
these circuits are used. Many of the circuits shown in this and the next chapter are incomplete and would
not be used in actual equipment. For example, the complete biasing network may not be shown. This is
done so you can concentrate on the concepts being presented without being overwhelmed by an
abundance of circuit elements. With this idea in mind, the information that is presented in this chapter is
real, practical information about video and rf amplifiers. It is the sort of information that you will use in
working with these circuits. Engineering information (such as design specifications) will not be presented
because it is not needed to understand the concepts that a technician needs to perform the job of circuit
analysis and repair. Before you are given the specific information on video and rf amplifiers, you may be
wondering how these circuits are used.
</p><p class="paragraph">Video amplifiers are used to amplify signals that represent video information. (That’s where the term
"video" comes from.) Video is the "picture" portion of a television signal. The "sound" portion is audio.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Although the Navy uses television in many ways, video signals are used for more than television. Radar
systems (discussed later in this training series) use video signals and, therefore, video amplifiers. Video
amplifiers are also used in video recorders and some communication and control devices. In addition to
using video amplifiers, televisions use rf amplifiers. Many other devices also use rf amplifiers, such as
radios, navigational devices, and communications systems. Almost any device that uses broadcast, or
transmitted, information will use an rf amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you should recall, rf amplifiers are used to amplify signals between 10 kilohertz (10 kHz) and
100,000 megahertz (100,000 MHz) (not this entire band of frequencies, but any band of frequencies
within these limits). Therefore, any device that uses frequencies between 10 kilohertz and 100,000
megahertz will most likely use an rf amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before you study the details of video and rf amplifiers, you need to learn a little more about the
frequency response of an amplifier and frequency-response curves.
</p><p class="paragraph">AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY RESPONSE
In chapter 1 of this module you were shown the frequency-response curve of an audio amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">Every amplifier has a frequency-response curve associated with it. Technicians use frequency-response
curves because they provide a "picture" of the performance of an amplifier at various frequencies. You
will probably never have to draw a frequency-response curve, but, in order to use one, you should know
how a frequency-response curve is created. The amplifier for which the frequency-response curve is
created is tested at various frequencies. At each frequency, the input signal is set to some predetermined
level of voltage (or current). This same voltage (or current) level for all of the input signals is used to
provide a standard input and to allow evaluation of the output of the circuit at each of the frequencies
tested. For each of these frequencies, the output is measured and marked on a graph. The graph is marked
"frequency" along the horizontal axis and "voltage" or "current" along the vertical axis. When points have
been plotted for all of the frequencies tested, the points are connected to form the frequency-response
curve. The shape of the curve represents the frequency response of the amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some amplifiers should be "flat" across a band of frequencies. In other words, for every frequency
within the band, the amplifier should have equal gain (equal response). For frequencies outside the band,
the amplifier gain will be much lower.
</p><p class="paragraph">For other amplifiers, the desired frequency response is different. For example, perhaps the amplifier
should have high gain at two frequencies and low gain for all other frequencies. The frequency-response
curve for this type of amplifier would show two "peaks." In other amplifiers the frequency-response curve
will have one peak indicating high gain at one frequency and lower gain at all others.
</p><p class="paragraph">Note the frequency-response curve shown in figure 2-1. This is the frequency-response curve for an
audio amplifier as described in chapter 1. It is "flat" from 15 hertz (15 Hz) to 20 kilohertz (20 kHz).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Notice in the figure that the lower frequency limit is labeled f1 and the upper frequency limit is
labeled f2. Note also the portion inside the frequency-response curve marked "BANDWIDTH." You may
be wondering just what a "bandwidth" is.
BANDWIDTH OF AN AMPLIFIER
</p><p class="paragraph">The bandwidth represents the amount or "width" of frequencies, or the "band of frequencies," that
the amplifier is MOST effective in amplifying. However, the bandwidth is NOT the same as the band of
frequencies that is amplified. The bandwidth (BW) of an amplifier is the difference between the
frequency limits of the amplifier. For example, the band of frequencies for an amplifier may be from 10
kilohertz (10 kHz) to 30 kilohertz (30 kHz). In this case, the bandwidth would be 20 kilohertz (20 kHz).
As another example, if an amplifier is designed to amplify frequencies between 15 hertz (15 Hz) and 20
kilohertz (20 kHz), the bandwidth will be equal to 20 kilohertz minus 15 hertz or 19,985 hertz (19,985
Hz). This is shown in figure 2-1.
</p><p class="paragraph">Mathematically:
</p><p class="paragraph">You should notice on the figure that the frequency-response curve shows output voltage (or current)
against frequency. The lower and upper frequency limits (f1 and f2) are also known as HALF-POWER
POINTS. The half-power points are the points at which the output voltage (or current) is 70.7 percent of
the maximum output voltage (or current). Any frequency that produces less than 70.7 percent of the
maximum output voltage (or current) is outside the bandwidth and, in most cases, is not considered a
useable output of the amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">The reason these points are called "half-power points" is that the true output power will be half (50
percent) of the maximum true output power when the output voltage (or current) is 70.7 percent of the
maximum output voltage (or current), as shown below. (All calculations are rounded off to two decimal
places.)
</p><p class="paragraph">As you learned in NEETS, Module 2, in an a.c. circuit true power is calculated using the resistance
(R) of the circuit, NOT the impedance (Z). If the circuit produces a maximum output voltage of 10 volts
across a 50-ohm load, then:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

now see how a frequency-response curve can enable you to determine the frequency limits and the
bandwidth of an amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">READING AMPLIFIER FREQUENCY-RESPONSE CURVES
Figure 2-2 shows the frequency-response curves for four different amplifiers. View (A) is the same
</p><p class="paragraph">frequency-response curve as shown in figure 2-1. View (B) is the frequency-response curve of an
amplifier that would also be classified as an audio amplifier, even though the curve is not "flat" from 15
hertz to 20 kilohertz and does not drop off sharply at the frequency limits. From the curve, you can see
that the lower frequency limit of this amplifier (f1) is 100 hertz. The upper frequency limit (f 2) is 10
kilohertz. Therefore, the bandwidth of this amplifier must be 10 kilohertz minus 100 hertz or 9900 hertz.
Most amplifiers will have a frequency-response curve shaped like view (B) if nothing is done to modify
the frequency-response characteristics of the circuit. (The factors that affect frequency response and the
methods to modify the frequency response of an amplifier are covered a little later in this chapter.)

</p><h3 class="subsection">FACTORS AFFECTING FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF AN AMPLIFIER
In chapter 1 of this module, the fact was mentioned that an audio amplifier is limited in its frequency
</h3><p class="paragraph">response. Now you will see why this is true.
</p><p class="paragraph">You should recall that the frequency response of an a.c. circuit is limited by the reactive elements
(capacitance and inductance) in the circuit. As you know, this is caused by the fact that the capacitive and
inductive reactances vary with the frequency. In other words, the value of the reactance is determined, in
part, by frequency. Remember the formulas:
</p><p class="paragraph">If you ignore the amplifying device (transistor, electron tube, etc.), and if the amplifier circuit is
made up of resistors only, there should be no limits to the frequency response. In other words, a totally
resistive circuit would have no frequency limits. However, there is no such thing as a totally resistive
circuit because circuit components almost always have some reactance. In addition to the reactance of
other components in the circuit, most amplifiers use RC coupling. This means that a capacitor is used to
couple the signal in to and out of the circuit. There is also a certain amount of capacitance and inductance
in the wiring of the circuit. The end result is that all circuits are reactive. To illustrate this point, figure 2-4
shows amplifier circuits with the capacitance and inductance of the wiring represented as "phantom"
capacitors and inductors. The reactances of the capacitors (XC) and the inductors (XL) are shown as
"phantom" variable resistors. View (A) shows the circuit with a low-frequency input signal, and view (B)
shows the circuit with a high-frequency input signal.

</p><p class="paragraph">The actual circuit components are: C1, C2, C3, R1, R2, R3, and Q1. C1 is used to couple the input
signal. R1 develops the input signal. R2, the emitter resistor, is used for proper biasing and temperature
stability. C2 is a decoupling capacitor for R2. R3 develops the output signal. C3 couples the output signal
to the next stage. Q1 is the amplifying device.
</p><p class="paragraph">The phantom circuit elements representing the capacitance and inductance of the wiring are: L1, L2,
C4, and C5. L1 represents the inductance of the input wiring. L2 represents the inductance of the output
wiring. C4 represents the capacitance of the input wiring. C5 represents the capacitance of the output
wiring.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view (A) the circuit is shown with a low-frequency input signal. Since the formulas for capacitive
reactance and inductive reactance are:
</p><p class="paragraph">You should remember that if frequency is low, capacitive reactance will be high and inductive reactance
will be low. This is shown by the position of the variable resistors that represent the reactances. Notice
that XL1  and XL2 are low; therefore, they do not "drop" very much of the input and output signals. XC4
and XC5 are high; these reactances tend to "block" the input and output signals and keep them from going
to the power supplies (VBB and VCC). Notice that the output signal is larger in amplitude than the input
signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now look at view (B). The input signal is a high-frequency signal. Now XC is low and XL  is high.
XL1 and XL2 now drop part of the input and output signals. At the same time XC4  and XC5 tend to "short"
or "pass" the input and output signals to signal ground. The net effect is that both the input and output
signals are reduced. Notice that the output signal is smaller in amplitude than the input signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now you can see how the capacitance and inductance of the wiring affect an amplifier, causing the
output of an amplifier to be less for high-frequency signals than for low-frequency signals.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to the other circuit components, an amplifying device (transistor or electronic tube),
itself, reacts differently to high frequencies than it does to low frequencies. In earlier NEETS modules you
were told that transistors and electronic tubes have interelectrode capacitance. Figure 2-5 shows a portion
of the interelectrode capacitance of a transistor and the way in which this affects high- and low-frequency
signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view (A) a transistor is shown with phantom capacitors connected to represent the interelectrode
capacitance. CEB represents the emitter-to-base capacitance. CBC represents the base-to-collector
capacitance.
</p><p class="paragraph">For simplicity, in views (B) and (C) the capacitive reactance of these capacitors is shown by variable
resistors R1 (for CEB) and R2 (for CBC). View (B) shows the reactance as high when there is a
low-frequency input signal. In this case there is very little effect from the reactance on the transistor. The
transistor amplifies the input signal as shown in view (B). However, when a high-frequency input signal
is applied to the transistor, as in view (C), things are somewhat different. Now the capacitive reactance is
low (as shown by the settings of the variable resistors). In this case, as the base of the transistor attempts
to go positive during the first half of the input signal, a great deal of this positive signal is felt on the
emitter (through R1). If both the base and the emitter go positive at the same time, there is no change in
emitter-base bias and the conduction of the transistor will not change. Of course, a small amount of
change does occur in the emitter-base bias, but not as much as when the capacitive reactance is higher (at
low frequencies). As an output signal is developed in the collector circuit, part of this signal is fed back to
the base through R2. Since the signal on the collector is 180 degrees out of phase with the base signal,
this tends to drive the base negative. The effect of this is to further reduce the emitter-base bias and the
conduction of the transistor.During the second half of the input signal, the same effect occurs although the
polarity is reversed. The net effect is a reduction in the gain of the transistor as indicated by the small
output signal. This decrease in the amplifier output at higher frequencies is caused by the interelectrode
capacitance. (There are certain special cases in which the feedback signal caused by the interelectrode
capacitance is in phase with the base signal. However, in most cases, the feedback caused by
interelectrode capacitance is degenerative and is 180 degrees out of phase with the base signal as
explained above.)

</h2><p class="paragraph">As you have seen, a transistor amplifier is limited in its frequency response. You should also
remember from chapter 1 that a VIDEO AMPLIFIER should have a frequency response of 10 hertz (10
Hz) to 6 megahertz (6 MHz). The question has probably occurred to you: How is it possible to "extend"
the range of frequency response of an amplifier?
</p><h3 class="subsection">HIGH-FREQUENCY COMPENSATION FOR VIDEO AMPLIFIERS
If the frequency-response range of an audio amplifier must be extended to 6 megahertz (6 MHz) for
</h3><p class="paragraph">use as a video amplifier, some means must be found to overcome the limitations of the audio amplifier.
As you have seen, the capacitance of an amplifier circuit and the interelectrode capacitance of the
transistor (or electronic tube) cause the higher frequency response to be limited.
</p><p class="paragraph">In some ways capacitance and inductance can be thought of as opposites. As stated before, as
frequency increases, capacitive reactance decreases, and inductive reactance increases. Capacitance
opposes changes in voltage, and inductance opposes changes in current. Capacitance causes current to
lead voltage, and inductance causes voltage to lead current.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since frequency affects capacitive reactance and inductive reactance in opposite ways, and since it is
the capacitive reactance that causes the problem with high-frequency response, inductors are added to an
amplifier circuit to improve the high-frequency response. This is called HIGH-FREQUENCY
COMPENSATION. Inductors (coils), when used for high-frequency compensation, are called PEAKING
COILS. Peaking coils can be added to a circuit so they are in series with the output signal path or in
parallel to the output signal path. Instead of only in series or parallel, a combination of peaking coils in
series and parallel with the output signal path can also be used for high-frequency compensation.
</p><p class="paragraph">As in all electronic circuits, nothing comes free. The use of peaking coils WILL increase the
frequency response of an amplifier circuit, but it will ALSO lower the gain of the amplifier.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Series Peaking
</h3><p class="paragraph">The use of a peaking coil in series with the output signal path is known as SERIES PEAKING.
Figure 2-6 shows a transistor amplifier circuit with a series peaking coil. In this figure, R1 is the

</p><p class="paragraph">Before you study the specific techniques used in rf amplifiers, you should review some information
on the relationship between the input and output impedance of an amplifier and the gain of the amplifier
stage.
</p><h3 class="subsection">AMPLIFIER INPUT/OUTPUT IMPEDANCE AND GAIN
</h3><p class="paragraph">You should remember that the gain of a stage is calculated by using the input and output signals. The
formula used to calculate the gain of a stage is:
</p><p class="paragraph">Voltage gain is calculated using input and output voltage; current gain uses input and output current;
and power gain uses input and output power. For the purposes of our discussion, we will only be
concerned with voltage gain.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-11 shows a simple amplifier circuit with the input- and output-signal-developing
impedances represented by variable resistors. In this circuit, C1 and C2 are the input and output coupling
capacitors. R1 represents the impedance of the input circuit. R2 represents the input-signal-developing
impedance, and R3 represents the output impedance.
</p><p class="paragraph">R1 and R2 form a voltage-divider network for the input signal. When R2 is increased in value, the
input signal to the transistor (Q1) increases. This causes a larger output signal, and the gain of the stage
increases.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now look at the output resistor, R3. As R3 is increased in value, the output signal increases. This
also increases the gain of the stage.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see, increasing the input-signal-developing impedance, the output impedance, or both
will increase the gain of the stage. Of course there are limits to this process. The transistor must not be
overdriven with too high an input signal or distortion will result.
</p><p class="paragraph">With this principle in mind, if you could design a circuit that had maximum impedance at a specific
frequency (or band of frequencies), that circuit could be used in an rf amplifier. This FREQUENCY-
DETERMINING NETWORK could be used as the input-signal-developing impedance, the output
impedance, or both. The rf amplifier circuit would then be as shown in figure 2-12.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

FREQUENCY-DETERMINING NETWORK FOR AN RF AMPLIFIER
</p><p class="paragraph">What kind of circuit would act as a frequency-determining network? In general, a frequency-
determining network is a circuit that provides the desired response at a particular frequency. This
response could be maximum impedance or minimum impedance; it all depends on how the frequency-
determining network is used. You will see more about frequency-determining networks in NEETS,
Module 9—Introduction to Wave-Generation and Shaping Circuits. As you have seen, the frequency-
determining network needed for an rf amplifier should have maximum impedance at the desired
frequency.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before you are shown the actual components that make up the frequency-determining network for an
rf amplifier, look at figure 2-13, which is a simple parallel circuit. The resistors in this circuit are variable
and are connected together (ganged) in such a way that as the resistance of R1 increases, the resistance of
R2 decreases, and vice versa.
</p><p class="paragraph">If each resistor has a range from 0 to 200 ohms, the following relationship will exist between the
individual resistances and the resistance of the network (RT). (All values are in ohms, RT rounded off to
two decimal places. These are selected values; there are an infinite number of possible combinations.)</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

determining network needed for an rf amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are components that will vary their impedance (reactance) like the ganged resistors. As you
know, the reactance of an inductor and a capacitor vary as frequency changes. As frequency increases,
inductive reactance increases, and capacitive reactance decreases.

upon the value of the inductor and capacitor. If the inductor and capacitor are connected as a parallel LC
circuit, you will have the ideal frequency-determining network for an rf amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">The parallel LC circuit used as a frequency-determining network is called a TUNED CIRCUIT. This
circuit is "tuned" to give the proper response at the desired frequency by selecting the proper values of

</h2><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-14 and the other circuits you have been shown use capacitors to couple the signal in to and
out of the circuit (C1 and C4 in figure 2-14). As you remember from chapter 1, there are also other
methods of coupling signals from one stage to another. Transformer coupling is the most common
method used to couple rf amplifiers. Transformer coupling has many advantages over RC coupling for rf
amplifiers; for example, transformer coupling uses fewer components than capacitive coupling. It can also
provide a means of increasing the gain of the stage by using a step-up transformer for voltage gain. If a
current gain is required, a step-down transformer can be used.

network could act as the input-signal-developing impedance for the next stage, or the network could
represent some type of output device, such as a transmitting antenna.
</p><p class="paragraph">The tuned circuits formed by the transformer and capacitors may not have the bandwidth required for
the amplifier. In other words, the bandwidth of the tuned circuit may be too "narrow" for the requirements
of the amplifier. (For example, the rf amplifiers used in television receivers usually require a bandwidth
of 6 MHz.)
</p><p class="paragraph">One way of "broadening" the bandpass of a tuned circuit is to use a swamping resistor. This is
similar to the use of the swamping resistor that was shown with the series peaking coil in a video
amplifier. A swamping resistor connected in parallel with the tuned circuit will cause a much broader
bandpass. (This technique and the theory behind it are discussed in more detail in NEETS, Module 9.)
</p><p class="paragraph">Another technique used to broaden the bandpass involves the amount of coupling in the
transformers. For transformers, the term "coupling" refers to the amount of energy transferred from the
primary to the secondary of the transformer. This depends upon the number of flux lines from the primary
that intersect, or cut, the secondary. When more flux lines cut the secondary, more energy is transferred.
</p><p class="paragraph">Coupling is mainly a function of the space between the primary and secondary windings. A
transformer can be loosely coupled (having little transfer of energy), optimumly coupled (just the right
amount of energy transferred), or overcoupled (to the point that the flux lines of primary and secondary
windings interfere with each other).

bandwidth. In view (B) the transformer has optimum coupling; the bandwidth is wider and the curve is
relatively flat. In view (C) the transformer is overcoupled; the frequency response curve shows a broad
bandpass, but the curve "dips" in the middle showing that these frequencies are not developed as well as
others in the bandwidth.
</p><p class="paragraph">Optimum coupling will usually provide the necessary bandpass for the frequency-determining
network (and therefore the rf amplifier). For some uses, such as rf amplifiers in a television receiver, the
bandpass available from optimum coupling is not wide enough. In these cases, a swamping resistor (as
mentioned earlier) will be used with the optimum coupling to broaden the bandpass.
COMPENSATION OF RF AMPLIFIERS
</p><p class="paragraph">Now you have been shown the way in which an rf amplifier is configured to amplify a band of
frequencies and the way in which an rf amplifier can be "tuned" for a particular band of frequencies. You
have also seen some ways in which the bandpass of an rf amplifier can be adjusted. However, the
frequencies at which rf amplifiers operate are so high that certain problems exist.
</p><p class="paragraph">One of these problems is the losses that can occur in a transformer at these high frequencies. Another
problem is with interelectrode capacitance in the transistor. The process of overcoming these problems is
known as COMPENSATION.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Transformers in RF Amplifiers
</h3><p class="paragraph">As you recall from NEETS, Module 1, the losses in a transformer are classified as copper loss,
eddy-current loss, and hysteresis loss. Copper loss is not affected by frequency, as it depends upon the
resistance of the winding and the current through the winding. Similarly, eddy-current loss is mostly a
function of induced voltage rather than the frequency of that voltage. Hysteresis loss, however, increases
as frequency increases.
</p><p class="paragraph">Hysteresis loss is caused by the realignment of the magnetic domains in the core of the transformer
each time the polarity of the magnetic field changes. As the frequency of the a.c. increases, the number of
shifts in the magnetic field also increases (two shifts for each cycle of a.c.); therefore, the "molecular
friction" increases and the hysteresis loss is greater. This increase in hysteresis loss causes the efficiency
of the transformer (and therefore the amplifier) to decrease. The energy that goes into hysteresis loss is
taken away from energy that could go into the signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">RF TRANSFORMERS, specially designed for use with rf, are used to correct the problem of
excessive hysteresis loss in the transformer of an rf amplifier. The windings of rf transformers are wound
onto a tube of nonmagnetic material and the core is either powdered iron or air. These types of cores also
reduce eddy-current loss.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

NEUTRALIZATION. Neutralization is the process of counteracting or "neutralizing" the effects of
interelectrode capacitance.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-17 shows the effect of the base-to-collector interelectrode capacitance in an rf amplifier.
The "phantom" capacitor (CBC) represents the interelectrode capacitance between the base and the
collector of Q1. This is the interelectrode capacitance that has the most effect in an rf amplifier. As you
can see, CBC causes a degenerative (negative) feedback which decreases the gain of the amplifier. (There
are some special cases in which CBC can cause regenerative (positive) feedback. In this case, the
technique described below will provide negative feedback which will accomplish the neutralization of the
amplifier.)
</p><p class="paragraph">As you may recall, unwanted degenerative feedback can be counteracted (neutralized) by using
positive feedback. This is exactly what is done to neutralize an rf amplifier.

problem of unwanted degenerative feedback. Except for capacitor C4, this circuit is identical to the circuit
shown in figure 2-17. (When CBC causes regenerative feedback, C4 will still neutralize the amplifier. This
is true because C4 always provides a feedback signal which is 180 degrees out of phase with the feedback
signal caused by CBC.)

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">2-26
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-19 is the schematic diagram of a typical rf amplifier that is used in an AM radio receiver. In
figure 2-19, the input circuit is the antenna of the radio (L1-a coil) which forms part of an LC circuit
which is tuned to the desired station by variable capacitor C1. L1 is wound on the same core as L2, which
couples the input signal through C2 to the transistor (Q1). R1 is used to provide proper bias to Q1 from
the base power supply (VBB). R2 provides proper bias to the emitter of Q1, and C3 is used to bypass R2.
The primary of T1 and capacitor C4 form a parallel LC circuit which acts as the load for Q1. This LC
circuit is tuned by C4, which is ganged to C1 allowing the antenna and the LC circuit to be tuned
together. The primary of T1 is center-tapped to provide proper impedance matching with Q1.
</p><p class="paragraph">You may notice that no neutralization is shown in this circuit. This circuit is designed for the AM
broadcast band (535 kHz - 1605 kHz).
</p><p class="paragraph">At these relatively low rf frequencies the degenerative feedback caused by base-to-collector
interelectrode capacitance is minor and, therefore, the amplifier does not need neutralization.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-20 is a typical rf amplifier used in a vhf television receiver. The input-signal-developing
circuit for this amplifier is made up of L1, C1, and C2. The inductor tunes the input-signal-developing
circuit for the proper TV channel. (L1 can be switched out of the circuit and another inductor switched in
to the circuit by the channel selector.) R1 provides proper bias to Q1 from the base supply voltage (VBB).
Q1 is the transistor. Notice that the case of Q1 (the dotted circle around the transistor symbol) is shown to
be grounded. The case must be grounded because of the high frequencies (54 MHz - 217 MHz) used by
the circuit. R2 provides proper bias from the emitter of Q1, and C3 is used to bypass R2. C5 and L2 are a
parallel LC circuit which acts as the load for Q1. The LC circuit is tuned by L2 which is switched in to
and out of the LC circuit by the channel selector. L3 and C6 are a parallel LC circuit which develops the
signal for the next stage. The parallel LC circuit is tuned by L3 which is switched in to and out of the LC
circuit by the channel selector along with L1 and L2. (L1, L2, and L3 are actually part of a bank of
inductors. L1, L2, and L3 are in the circuit when the channel selector is on channel 2. For other channels,
another group of three inductors would be used in the circuit.) R3 develops a signal which is fed through
C4 to provide neutralization. This counteracts the effects of the interelectrode capacitance from the base
to the collector of Q1. C7 is used to isolate the rf signal from the collector power supply (VCC).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">impedance, feedback, frequency response, and coupling. With all this information behind you, you might
ask yourself "what more can there be to know about amplifiers?"
</p><p class="paragraph">There is a great deal more to learn about amplifiers. Even after you finish this chapter you will have
only "scratched the surface" of the study of amplifiers. But, you will have prepared yourself for the
remainder of the NEETS. This, in turn, should prepare you for further study and, perhaps, a career in
electronics.
</p><p class="paragraph">As in chapter 2, the circuits shown in this chapter are intended to present particular concepts to you.
Therefore, the circuits may be incomplete or not practical for use in an actual piece of electronic
equipment. You should keep in mind the fact that this text is intended to teach certain facts about
amplifiers, and in order to simplify the illustrations used, complete operational circuits are not always
shown.
</p><p class="paragraph">In this chapter three types of special amplifiers are discussed. These are: DIFFERENTIAL
AMPLIFIERS, OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIERS, and MAGNETIC AMPLIFIERS. These are called
special amplifiers because they are used only in certain types of equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">The names of each of these special amplifiers describe the operation of the amplifier, NOT what is
amplified. For example, a magnetic amplifier does not amplify magnetism but uses magnetic effects to
produce amplification of an electronic signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">A differential amplifier is an amplifier that can have two input signals and/or two output signals.
This amplifier can amplify the difference between two input signals. A differential amplifier will also
"cancel out" common signals at the two inputs.
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the more interesting aspects of an operational amplifier is that it can be used to perform
mathematical operations electronically. Properly connected, an operational amplifier can add, subtract,
multiply, divide, and even perform the calculus operations of integration and differentiation. These
amplifiers were originally used in a type of computer known as the "analog computer" but are now used
in many electronic applications.
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnetic amplifier uses a device called a "saturable core reactor" to control an a.c.output signal.
The primary use of magnetic amplifiers is in power control systems.
</p><p class="paragraph">These brief descriptions of the three special amplifiers are intended to provide you with a general
idea of what these amplifiers are and how they can be used. The remaining sections of this chapter will
provide you with more detailed information on these special amplifiers.

</p><p class="paragraph">with the differential amplifier: It operates on the difference between two inputs. However, the difference
amplifier has only one output while the differential amplifier can have two outputs.
</p><p class="paragraph">By now, you should be familiar with some amplifier circuits, which should give you an idea of what
a difference amplifier is like. In NEETS, Module 7, you were shown the basic configurations for transistor
amplifiers. Figure 3-1 shows two of these configurations: the common emitter and the common base.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view (A) of figure 3-1 a common-emitter amplifier is shown. The output signal is an amplified
version of the input signal and is 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal. View (B) is a common-
base amplifier. In this circuit the output signal is an amplified version of the input signal and is in phase
with the input signal. In both of these circuits, the output signal is controlled by the base-to-emitter bias.
As this bias changes (because of the input signal) the current through the transistor changes. This causes
the output signal developed across the collector load (R2) to change. None of this information is new, it is
just a review of what you have already been shown regarding transistor amplifiers.

publications you will see the term emitter-to-base used to describe the same bias arrangement.
</p><h3 class="subsection">THE TWO-INPUT, SINGLE-OUTPUT, DIFFERENCE AMPLIFIER
</h3><p class="paragraph">If you combine the common-base and common-emitter configurations into a single transistor
amplifier, you will have a circuit like the one shown in figure 3-2. This circuit is the two-input,
single-output, difference amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-2, the transistor has two inputs (the emitter and the base) and one output (the collector).
Remember, the current through the transistor (and therefore the output signal) is controlled by the
base-to-emitter bias. In the circuit shown in figure 3-2, the combination of the two input signals controls
the output signal. In fact, the DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INPUT SIGNALS determines the
base-to-emitter bias.
</p><p class="paragraph">For the purpose of examining the operation of the circuit shown in figure 3-2, assume that the circuit
has a gain of -10. This means that for each 1-volt change in the base-to-emitter bias, there would be a
10-volt change in the output signal. Assume, also, that the input signals will peak at 1-volt levels (+1 volt
for the positive peak and -1 volt for the negative peak). The secret to understanding this circuit (or any
transistor amplifier circuit) is to realize that the collector current is controlled by the base-to-emitter bias.
In other words, in this circuit the output signal (the voltage developed across R3) is determined by the
difference between the voltage on the base and the voltage on the emitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-3 shows this two-input, single-output amplifier with input signals that are equal in
amplitude and 180 degrees out of phase. Input number one has a positive alternation when input number
two has a negative alternation and vice versa.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-3 at time zero (T0) both input signals are at 0 volts. The output signal is also at 0 volts.
Between time zero (T0) and time one (T1), input signal number one goes positive and input signal
number two goes negative. Each of these voltage changes causes an increase in the base-to-emitter bias
which causes current through Q1 to increase. Increased current through Q1 results in a greater voltage
drop across the collector load (R3) which causes the output signal to go negative.
</p><p class="paragraph">By time one (T1), input signal number one has reached +1 volt and input signal number two has
reached - 1 volt. This is an overall increase in base-to-emitter bias of 2 volts. Since the gain of the circuit
is - 10, the output signal has decreased by 20 volts. As you can see, the output signal has been determined
by the difference between the two input signals. In fact, the base-to-emitter bias can be found by
subtracting the value of input signal number two from the value of input signal number one.
</p><p class="paragraph">Between time one (T1) and time two (T2), input signal number one goes from +1 volt to 0 volts and
input signal number two goes from - 1 volt to 0 volts. At time two (T2) both input signals are at 0 volts
and the base-to-emitter bias has returned to 0 volts. The output signal is also 0 volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">Between time two (T2) and time three (T3), input signal number one goes negative and input signal
number two goes positive. At time three (T3), the value of the base-to-emitter bias is - 2 volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">This causes the output signal to be +20 volts at time three (T3).
Between time three (T3) and time four (T4), input signal #1 goes from - 1 volt to 0 volts and input

always 0 volts. This causes a 0-volt output signal.

</p><p class="paragraph">From the above example, you can see that when the input signals are equal in amplitude and in
phase, there is no output from the difference amplifier because there is no difference between the two

the output looks just like the input except for amplitude and a 180-degree phase reversal with respect to
input signal number one. What happens if the input signals are equal in amplitude but different in phase
by something other than 180 degrees? This would mean that sometimes one signal would be going
negative while the other would be going positive; sometimes both signals would be going positive; and
sometimes both signals would be going negative. Would the output signal still look like the input signals?
The answer is "no," because figure 3-5 shows a difference amplifier with two input signals that are equal
in amplitude but 90 degrees out of phase. From the figure you can see that at time zero (T0) input number
one is at 0 volts and input number two is at -1 volt. The base-to-emitter bias is found to be +1 volt.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-6 is the schematic diagram of a typical differential amplifier. Notice that there are two
inputs and two outputs. This circuit requires two transistors to provide the two inputs and two outputs. If
you look at one input and the transistor with which it is associated, you will see that each transistor is a
common-emitter amplifier for that input (input one and Q1; input two and Q2). R1 develops the signal at
input one for Q1, and R5 develops the signal at input two for Q2. R3 is the emitter resistor for both Q1
and Q2. Notice that R3 is NOT bypassed. This means that when a signal at input one affects the current
through Q1, that signal is developed by R3. (The current through Q1 must flow through R3; as this
current changes, the voltage developed across R3 changes.) When a signal is developed by R3, it is
applied to the emitter of Q2. In the same way, signals at input two affect the current of Q2, are developed
by R3, and are felt on the emitter of Q1. R2 develops the signal for output one, and R4 develops the
signal for output two.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Since the base of Q2 is grounded, the current through Q2 decreases with a positive-going signal on the

more of a voltage drop across R4. Therefore, the voltage at the bottom of R4 decreases and a negative-

</p><p class="paragraph">This single-input, single-output, differential amplifier is very similar to a single-transistor amplifier

with each other. The single-input, differential-output, differential amplifier will do the same thing.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-8 shows a differential amplifier with one input (the base of Q1) and two outputs (the

</p><p class="paragraph">This circuit’s operation is the same as for the single-input, single-output differential amplifier just
described. However, another output is obtained from the bottom of R2. As the input signal goes positive,
thus causing increased current through Q1, R2 has a greater voltage drop. The output signal at the bottom
of R2 therefore is negative going. A negative-going input signal will decrease current and reverse the
polarities of both output signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now you see how a differential amplifier can produce two amplified, differential output signals from
a single-input signal. One further point of interest about this configuration is that if a combined output
signal is taken between outputs number one and two, this single output will be twice the amplitude of the
individual outputs. In other words, you can double the gain of the differential amplifier (single output) by
taking the output signal between the two output terminals. This single-output signal will be in phase with
the input signal. This is shown by the phantom signal above R5 (the phantom resistor connected between
outputs number one and two would be used to develop this signal).

difference (differential) signal to be twice as large as either input alone. (This is just like the two-input,
single-output difference amplifier with input signals that are 180 degrees out of phase.)
</p><p class="paragraph">Output number one is a signal that is in phase with input number two, and output number two is a
signal that is in phase with input number one. The amplitude of each output signal is the input signal

greater in amplitude than either input signal by a factor of the gain of the amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">When an output signal is taken between the two output terminals of the amplifier (as shown by the
phantom connections, resistor, and signal), the combined output signal is twice as great in amplitude as
either signal at output number one or output number two. (This is because output number one and output
number two are 180 degrees out of phase with each other.) When the input signals are 180 degrees out of

a.c. amplifiers, comparators, oscillators (which are covered in NEETS, Module 9), filter circuits, and many
other applications. The reason for this widespread use of the operational amplifier is that it is a very
versatile and efficient device. As an integrated circuit (chip) the operational amplifier has become an
inexpensive and readily available "building block" for many devices. In fact, an operational amplifier in
integrated circuit form is no more expensive than a good transistor.

the output signal will be 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (and one-half the amplitude of the

</h2><p class="paragraph">Operational amplifiers can have either a closed-loop operation or an open-loop operation. The
operation (closed-loop or open-loop) is determined by whether or not feedback is used. Without feedback
the operational amplifier has an open-loop operation. This open-loop operation is practical only when the
operational amplifier is used as a comparator (a circuit which compares two input signals or compares an
input signal to some fixed level of voltage). As an amplifier, the open-loop operation is not practical
because the very high gain of the operational amplifier creates poor stability. (Noise and other unwanted
signals are amplified so much in open-loop operation that the operational amplifier is usually not used in
this way.) Therefore, most operational amplifiers are used with feedback (closed-loop operation).
</p><p class="paragraph">Operational amplifiers are used with degenerative (or negative) feedback which reduces the gain of
the operational amplifier but greatly increases the stability of the circuit. In the closed-loop configuration,
the output signal is applied back to one of the input terminals. This feedback is always degenerative
(negative). In other words, the feedback signal always opposes the effects of the original input signal. One
result of degenerative feedback is that the inverting and noninverting inputs to the operational amplifier
will be kept at the same potential.
</p><p class="paragraph">Closed-loop circuits can be of the inverting configuration or noninverting configuration. Since the
inverting configuration is used more often than the noninverting configuration, the inverting configuration
will be shown first.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Inverting Configuration

</p><p class="paragraph">At this point it is important to keep in mind the difference between the entire circuit (or operational
circuit) and the operational amplifier. The operational amplifier is represented by the triangle-like symbol
while the operational circuit includes the resistors and any other components as well as the operational
amplifier. In other words, the input to the circuit is shown in figure 3-13, but the signal at the inverting
input of the operational amplifier is determined by the feedback signal as well as by the circuit input
signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see in figure 3-13, the output signal is 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal. The
feedback signal is a portion of the output signal and, therefore, also 180 degrees out of phase with the
input signal. Whenever the input signal goes positive, the output signal and the feedback signal go
negative. The result of this is that the inverting input to the operational amplifier is always very close to 0
volts with this configuration. In fact, with the noninverting input grounded, the voltage at the inverting
input to the operational amplifier is so small compared to other voltages in the circuit that it is considered
to be VIRTUAL GROUND. (Remember, in a closed-loop operation the inverting and noninverting inputs
are at the same potential.)
</p><p class="paragraph">Virtual ground is a point in a circuit which is at ground potential (0 volts) but is NOT connected to
ground. Figure 3-14, (view A) (view B) and (view C), shows an example of several circuits with points at
virtual ground.

</p><p class="paragraph">The whole point is that the inverting input to the operational amplifier shown in figure 3-13 is at
virtual ground since it is at 0 volts (for all practical purposes). Because the inverting input is at 0 volts,
there will be no current (for all practical purposes) flowing into the operational amplifier from the
connection point of R1 and R2.
</p><p class="paragraph">Given these conditions, the characteristics of this circuit are determined almost entirely by the values
of R1 and R2. Figure 3-15 should help show how the values of R1 and R2 determine the circuit
characteristics.
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: It should be stressed at this point that for purpose of explanation the operational amplifier is
a theoretically perfect amplifier. In actual practice we are dealing with less than perfect. In the practical
operational amplifier there will be a slight input current with a resultant power loss. This small signal can
be measured at the theoretical point of virtual ground. This does not indicate faulty operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">The input signal causes current to flow through R1. (Only the positive half cycle of the input signal
is shown and will be discussed.) Since the voltage at the inverting input of the operational amplifier is at 0
volts, the input current (Iin) is computed by:
</p><p class="paragraph">The output signal (which is opposite in phase to the input signal) causes a feedback current (Ifdbk) to
flow through R2. The left-hand side of R2 is at 0 volts (point A) and the right-hand side is at Eout.
Therefore, the feedback current is computed by:

reaching point A from R1 must flow out of point A through R2. Therefore, the input current (Iin) and the

alternation of the signal is shown.) It may appear as if the feedback is regenerative (positive) because the

input signals is applied to the noninverting input and the feedback signal is applied to the inverting input,
(Remember, that the operational amplifier will react to the difference between the two inputs.)

specification sheets for operational amplifiers will usually state the open-loop (no feedback) gain for d.c.
(or 0 hertz). At higher frequencies, the gain is much lower. In fact, for an operational amplifier, the gain
decreases quite rapidly as frequency increases.

in (the point at which the gain of the amplifier is 1), is 1 megahertz for the amplifier. As you can see, the

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-17 is the open-loop frequency-response curve. You have been told that most operational
amplifiers are used in a closed-loop configuration. When you look at the frequency-response curve for a
closed-loop configuration, one of the most interesting and important aspects of the operational amplifier
becomes apparent: The use of degenerative feedback increases the bandwidth of an operational amplifier
circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">This phenomenon is another example of the difference between the operational amplifier itself and
the operational-amplifier circuit (which includes the components in addition to the operational amplifier).
You should also be able to see that the external resistors not only affect the gain of the circuit, but the

</p><p class="paragraph">You might wonder exactly how the gain and bandwidth of a closed-loop, operational-amplifier
circuit are related. Figure 3-18 should help to show you the relationship. The frequency-response curve

</p><p class="paragraph">The relationship between circuit gain and bandwidth in an operational-amplifier circuit can be
expressed by the GAIN-BANDWIDTH PRODUCT (GAIN ·  BANDWIDTH = UNITY GAIN POINT).
In other words, for operational-amplifier circuits, the gain times the bandwidth for one configuration of an
operational amplifier will equal the gain times the bandwidth for any other configuration of the same
operational amplifier. In other words, when the gain of an operational-amplifier circuit is changed (by
changing the value of feedback or input resistors), the bandwidth also changes. But the gain times the
bandwidth of the first configuration will equal the gain times the bandwidth of the second configuration.
The following example should help you to understand this concept.
</p><p class="paragraph">The frequency-response curves shown in figures 3-17, 3-18, and 3-19 have a gain-bandwidth product
of 1,000,000. In figure 3-17, the gain is 100,000 and the bandwidth is 10 hertz. The gain-bandwidth
product is 100,000 times 10 (Hz), or 1,000,000. In figure 3-18, the gain has been reduced to 100 and the
bandwidth increases to 10 kilohertz. The gain-bandwidth product is 100 times 10,000 (Hz) which is also
equal to 1,000,000. In figure 3-19 the gain has been reduced to 10 and the bandwidth is 100 kilohertz. The
gain-bandwidth product is 10 times 100,000 (Hz), which is 1,000,000. If the gain were reduced to 1, the
bandwidth would be 1 megahertz (which is shown on the frequency-response curve as the unity-gain

</h2><p class="paragraph">You have now been shown various ways that electron tubes (NEETS, Module 6) and transistors
(NEETS, Module 7) can be used to amplify signals. You have also been shown the way in which this is
done. There is another type of amplifier in use—the MAGNETIC AMPLIFIER, sometimes called the
MAG AMP.
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnetic amplifier has certain advantages over other types of amplifiers. These include (1) high
efficiency (up to 90 percent); (2) reliability (long life, freedom from maintenance, reduction of spare parts
inventory); (3) ruggedness (shock and vibration resistance, high overload capability, freedom from effects
of moisture); and (4) no warm-up time. The magnetic amplifier has no moving parts and can be
hermetically sealed within a case similar to the conventional dry-type transformer.
</p><p class="paragraph">However, the magnetic amplifier has a few disadvantages. For example, it cannot handle low-level
signals; it is not useful at high frequencies; it has a time delay associated with the magnetic effects; and
the output waveform is not an exact reproduction of the input waveform (poor fidelity).
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnetic amplifier is important, however, to many phases of naval engineering because it
provides a rugged, trouble-free device that has many applications aboard ship and in aircraft. These
applications include throttle controls on the main engines of ships; speed, frequency, voltage, current, and
temperature controls on auxiliary equipment; and fire control, servomechanisms, and stabilizers for guns,
radar, and sonar equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">As stated earlier, the magnetic amplifier does not amplify magnetism, but uses electromagnetism to
amplify a signal. It is a power amplifier with a very limited frequency response. Technically, it falls into
the classification of an audio amplifier; but, since the frequency response is normally limited to 100 hertz
and below, the magnetic amplifier is more correctly called a low-frequency amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic principle of a magnetic amplifier is very simple. (Remember, all amplifiers are current-
control devices.) A magnetic amplifier uses a changing inductance to control the power delivered to a
load.

increases. Finally, as I increases, true power increases.
</p><p class="paragraph">This general conclusion can be confirmed by using some actual values of inductance in the formulas
along with other values from figure 3-29.

</p><p class="paragraph">Permeability was defined as the measure of the ability of a material to act as a path for additional
magnetic lines of force. Soft iron was presented as having high permeability compared with air. In fact,
the permeability of unmagnetized iron is 5000 while air has a permeability of 1. A nonmagnetized piece
of iron has high permeability because the tiny molecular magnets (Weber's Theory) or the directions of
electron spin (Domain Theory) are able to be aligned by a magnetic field. As they align, they act as a path
for the magnetic lines of force.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">3-46
</p><p class="paragraph">Earlier NEETS modules state that the inductance of a coil increases directly as the permeability of
the core material increases. If a coil is wound around an iron core, the permeability of the core is 5000.
Now, if the iron is pulled part way out of the coil of wire, the core is part iron and part air. The
permeability of the core decreases. As the permeability of the core decreases, the inductance of the coil
decreases. This increases the power delivered to the load (true power). This relationship is shown in
figure 3-30.
</p><p class="paragraph">The system shown in figure 3-30 is not too practical. Even if a motor were used in place of the hand
that is shown, the resulting amplifier would be large, expensive, and not easily controlled. If the
permeability of a core could be changed by electrical means rather than mechanical, a more practical
system would result.
</p><p class="paragraph">High permeability depends on there being many molecular magnets (or electron spin directions) that
can be aligned to provide a path for magnetic lines of force. If almost all of these available paths are
already being used, the material is magnetized and there are no more paths for additional lines of force.
The "flux density" (number of lines of force passing through a given area) is as high as it can be. This
means that the permeability of the material has decreased. When this condition is reached, the core is said
to be SATURATED because it is saturated (filled) with all the magnetic lines of force it can pass. At this
point, the core has almost the same value of permeability as air (1) instead of the much higher value of
permeability (5000) that it had when it was unmagnetized.
</p><p class="paragraph">Of course, the permeability does not suddenly change from 5000 to 1. The permeability changes as
the magnetizing force changes until saturation is reached. At saturation, permeability remains very low no
matter how much the magnetizing force increases. If you were to draw a graph of the flux density
compared to the magnetizing force, you would have something similar to the graph shown in figure 3-31.
Figure 3-31 also includes a curve representing the value of permeability as the magnetizing force
increases. Point "s" in figure 3-31 is the point of saturation. The flux density does not increase above
point "s," and the permeability is at a steady, low value.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">You have now seen how a change in the magnetizing force causes a change in permeability. The
next question is, how do you change the magnetizing force? Magnetizing force is a function of
AMPERE-TURNS. (An ampere-turn is the magnetomotive force developed by 1 ampere of current
flowing in a coil of one turn.) If you increase the ampere-turns of a coil, the magnetizing force increases.
Since it is not practical to increase the number of turns, the easiest way to accomplish this is to increase
the current through the coil.
</p><p class="paragraph">If you increase the current through a coil, you increase the ampere-turns. By increasing the ampere-
turns you increase the magnetizing force. At some point, this causes a decrease in the permeability of the
core. With the permeability of the core decreased, the inductance of the coil decreases. As said before, a
decrease in the inductance causes an increase in power through the load. A device that uses this
arrangement is called a SATURABLE-CORE REACTOR or SATURABLE REACTOR.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SATURABLE-CORE-REACTOR-3-47-">SATURABLE-CORE REACTOR
</h2><p class="paragraph">A saturable-core reactor is a magnetic-core reactor (coil) whose reactance is controlled by changing
the permeability of the core. The permeability of the core is changed by varying a unidirectional flux (flux
in one direction) through the core.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-32 shows a saturable-core reactor that is used to control the intensity of a lamp. Notice that
two coils are wound around a single core. The coil on the left is connected to a rheostat and a battery.
This coil is called the control coil because it is part of the control circuit. The coil on the right is
connected to a lamp (the load) and an a.c. source. This coil is called the load coil because it is part of the
load circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">As the wiper (the movable connection) of the rheostat is moved toward the right, there is less
resistance in the control circuit. With less resistance, the control-circuit current increases. This causes the
amount of magnetism in the core to increase and the inductance of the coil in the load circuit to decrease
(because the core is common to both coils). With less inductance in the load circuit, load current increases
and the lamp gets brighter.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the two windings is a saturable-core symbol indicating that the two windings share a saturable core.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now that you have seen the basic operation of a saturable-core reactor, there is one other idea to
discuss before moving on to the circuitry of a magnetic amplifier. There is a point upon the magnetization
curve where the saturable-core reactor should be operated. The ideal operating point is the place in which
a small increase in control current will cause a large increase in output power and a small decrease in
control current will cause a large decrease in output power. This point is on the flattest portion of the
permeability curve (after its peak).
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-34 shows the magnetization and permeability curves for a saturable-core reactor with the
ideal operating point (point "O") indicated. Notice point "O" on the magnetization curve. The portion of
the magnetization curve where point "O" is located is called the KNEE OF THE CURVE. The knee of the
curve is the point of maximum curvature. It is called the "knee" because it looks like the knee of a leg that
is bent. Saturable-core reactors and magnetic amplifiers should be operated on the knee of the
magnetization curve.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When the saturable-core reactor is set at the knee of the magnetization curve, any small increase in
control current will cause a large increase in load current. Any small decrease in control current will cause
a large decrease in load current. That is why point "O" is the ideal operating point-because small changes
in control current will cause large changes in load current. In other words, the saturable-core reactor can
amplify the control current. However, a saturable-core reactor is NOT a magnetic amplifier. You will find
out a little later how a magnetic amplifier differs from a saturable-core reactor. First you should know a
few more things about the saturable-core reactor.
</p><p class="paragraph">If a d.c. voltage is applied to the control winding of a saturable-core reactor and an a.c. voltage is
applied to the load windings, the a.c. flux will aid the d.c. flux on one half cycle and oppose the d.c. flux
on the other half cycle. This is shown in figure 3-35. Load flux is indicated by the dashed-line arrows, and
control flux is indicated by the solid-line arrows. View (A) shows the load and control flux adding during
one half cycle of the a.c. View (B) of the figure shows the load and control flux opposing during the other
half cycle of the a.c.

However, the situation would be better if the load flux was not an influence on the control flux. Figure

</p><p class="paragraph">During the first half cycle, the load circuit flux (dashed-line arrows) cancels in the center leg of the
core. This is shown in figure 3-36, view (A). As a result, there is no effect upon the flux from the control
circuit. During the second half cycle, the polarity of the a.c. (and therefore the polarity of the flux)
reverses as shown in view (B). The result is the same as it was during the first half cycle. There is no

Figure 3-37 shows a toroidal saturable-core reactor. The shape of these cores is a toroid (donut shape).
The windings are wound around the cores so that the load flux aids the control flux in one core and
opposes the control flux in the other core.
</p><p class="paragraph">During the first half cycle, the flux aids in the left core and opposes in the right core, as shown in

</p><p class="paragraph">Figures 3-36 and 3-37 both represent practical, workable saturable-core reactors. Circuits similar to
these are actually used to control lighting in auditoriums or electric industrial furnaces. These circuits are
sometimes referred to as magnetic amplifiers, but that is NOT technically correct. A magnetic amplifier
differs from a saturable-core reactor in one important aspect: A magnetic amplifier has a rectifier in
addition to a saturable-core reactor.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-42. If the permeability of the core of a coil increases, what happens to (a) inductance and (b) true
power in the circuit?
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-43. What happens to the permeability of an iron core as the current increases from the operating
point to a large value?
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-44. If two coils are wound on a single iron core, what will a change in current in one coil cause in
the other coil?
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-45. What symbol in figure 3-33 indicates a saturable core connecting two windings?
SIMPLIFIED MAGNETIC AMPLIFIER CIRCUITRY
</p><p class="paragraph">If the saturable-core reactor works, why do we need to add a rectifier to produce a magnetic
amplifier? To answer this question, recall that in NEETS, Module 2—Introduction to Alternating Current
and Transformers, you were told about hysteresis loss. Hysteresis loss occurs because the a.c. applied to a
coil causes the tiny molecular magnets (or electron-spin directions) to realign as the polarity of the a.c.
changes. This realignment uses up power. The power that is used for realignment is a loss as far as the
rest of the circuit is concerned. Because of this hysteresis loss in the saturable-core reactor, the power
gain is relatively low. A rectifier added to the load circuit will eliminate the hysteresis loss and increase
the gain. This is because the rectifier allows current to flow in only one direction through the load coils.
</p><p class="paragraph">A simple half-wave magnetic amplifier is shown in figure 3-38. This is a half-wave magnetic
amplifier because it uses a half-wave rectifier. During the first half cycle of the load voltage, the diode
conducts and the load windings develop load flux as shown in view (A) by the dashed-line arrows. The</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

cycle, the diode does not conduct and the load coils develop no flux, as shown in view (B). The load flux
never has to reverse direction as it did in the saturable-core reactor, so the hysteresis loss is eliminated.
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit shown in figure 3-38 is only able to use half of the load voltage (and therefore half the
possible load power) since the diode blocks current during half the load-voltage cycle. A full-wave
rectifier used in place of CR1 would allow current flow during the entire cycle of load voltage while still
preventing hysteresis loss.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-39 shows a simple full-wave magnetic amplifier. The bridge circuit of CR1, CR2, CR3,
CR4 allows current to flow in the load circuit during the entire load voltage cycle, but the load current is
always in the same direction. This current flow in one direction prevents hysteresis loss.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
