information you are expected to learn in the chapter. The comprehension check questions placed within

</p><p class="learningobjective">2. State the prerequisites for magnetic recording.
</p><p class="learningobjective">3. Describe a magnetic recording head, how it’s constructed, and how it operates.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-1-1-">INTRODUCTION
</h2><p class="paragraph">Have you ever wondered how a whole album of your favorite music got onto one of those little
cassette tapes? Or, what about computer floppy disks; have you ever wondered how they can hold 180 or
more pages of typed text? The answer to both of these questions is magnetic recording.
</p><p class="paragraph">Magnetic recording devices seldom get much attention until they fail to work. But without magnetic
recording, recording your favorite television show on a video cassette recorder would be impossible,
portable tape players wouldn’t exist, and you wouldn’t be able to get money from an automated bank teller
machine at two o’clock in the morning.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now what about the Navy? Could it operate without magnetic recording? The answer is definitely
no. Without it:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Computer programs and data would have to be stored on either paper cards or on rolls of paper
tape. Both of these methods need a lot of storage space, and they take much longer to load into
and out of the computer.
</p><p class="paragraph">• There wouldn’t be any movies to show or music to play on the ship’s entertainment system when
the ship is at sea and is out of range for television and radio reception.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Intelligence-collection missions would be impossible since you couldn’t store the collected
signals for later analysis.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see, magnetic recording plays a very important part both in our Navy life and in our
civilian life.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HISTORY-OF-MAGNETIC-RECORDERS-1-2-">HISTORY OF MAGNETIC RECORDERS
</h2><p class="paragraph">In 1888, Oberlin Smith originated the idea of using permanent magnetic impressions to record
sounds. Then in 1900, Vladeniar Poulsen brought Mr. Smith’s dream to reality. At the Paris Exposition,
he demonstrated a Telegraphone. It was a device that recorded sounds onto a steel wire. Although
everyone thought it was a great idea, they didn’t think it would succeed since you had to use an earphone
to hear what was recorded. It wasn’t until 1925, when electronic amplifiers were developed, that magnetic
recording started to receive the attention it deserved.
</p><p class="paragraph">The best magnetic recording is the one that produces an output signal identical to the input signal. It
didn’t take long to realize that the magnetism generated during the recording process didn’t vary directly
to the current which caused it. This is because there’s a step in the magnetism curve where it crosses the
zero point and changes polarity. This step causes the output signal to be distorted when compared with the
input signal. Figure 1-1 shows this step.
</p><p class="paragraph">In 1907, Mr. Poulsen discovered a solution to this problem. He discovered dc bias. He found that if a
fixed dc voltage were added to the input signal, it moved the input signal away from the step in the
magnetism curve. This prevented the input signal from crossing the zero-point of the magnetism curve.
The result is an output signal exactly like the input signal. Figure 1-2 shows this process.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-3
</p><p class="paragraph">Unfortunately, dc bias had its problems. Since only a small portion of the magnetism curve was
straight enough to use, the output signal was weak compared with the natural hiss of the unmagnetized
tape passing the playback head. This is commonly called poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We’ll explain
SNR in more detail later.
</p><p class="paragraph">From the beginning, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratories (NRL) saw great potential in magnetic
recording. They were especially interested in using it to transmit telegraph signals at high speed. After
electronic amplifiers were invented around 1925, W.L. Carlson and G.W. Carpenter at the NRL made the
next important magnetic recording discovery. They found that adding an ac bias voltage to the input
signal instead of a fixed dc bias voltage would
</p><h3 class="subsection">• reproduce a stronger output signal
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• greatly improve the signal-to-noise ratio
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• greatly reduce the natural tape hiss that was so common with dc bias
</h3><p class="paragraph">To make ac bias work, they used an ac frequency for the bias voltage that was well above what could
be heard, and a level that placed the original input signal away from both steps in the magnetism curve.
This resulted in two undistorted output signals that could be combined into one strong output. See figure
1-3.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Until 1935, all magnetic recording was on steel wire. Then, at the 1935 German Annual Radio
Exposition in Berlin, Fritz Pfleumer demonstrated his Magnetophone. It used a cellulose acetate tape
coated with soft iron powder. The Magnetophone and its "paper" tapes were used until 1947 when the 3M
Company introduced the first plastic-based magnetic tape.
</p><p class="paragraph">In 1956, IBM introduced the next major contribution to magnetic recording—the hard disk drive.
The disk was a 24-inch solid metal platter and stored 4.4 megabytes of information. Later, in 1963, IBM
reduced the platter size and introduced a 14-inch hard disk drive.
</p><p class="paragraph">Until 1966, all hard disk drives were "fixed" drives. Their platters couldn't be removed. Then in
1966, IBM introduced the first removable-pack hard disk drive. It also used a 14-inch solid metal platter.
</p><p class="paragraph">In 1971, magnetic tape became popular again when the 3M Company introduced the first 1/4-inch
magnetic tape cartridge and tape drive. In that same year, IBM invented the 8-inch floppy disk and disk
drive. It used a flexible 8-inch platter of the same material as magnetic tape. Its main goal was to replace
punched cards as a program-loading device.
</p><p class="paragraph">The next contribution to magnetic recording literally started the personal computer (PC) revolution.
In 1980, a little-known company named Seagate Technology invented the 5-1/4-inch floppy disk drive.
Without it, PCs as we know them today would not exist.
</p><p class="paragraph">From then on, it was all downhill. Magnetic tape became more sophisticated. Floppy disks and disk
drives became smaller, while their capacities grew bigger. And hard disk capacities just went through the
roof. All of the major hurdles affecting magnetic recording had been successfully cleared, and it was just
a matter of refining both its methods and materials.

PREREQUISITES FOR MAGNETIC RECORDING
</p><p class="paragraph">To perform magnetic recording, you need three things:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. An input signal you wish to record.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. A recording medium. (This is a recording surface that will hold the signal you wish to record.)
3. A magnetic head to convert the input signal into a magnetic field so it can be recorded.
</p><p class="paragraph">If any one of these are missing, magnetic recording cannot take place.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Input Signal
</h3><p class="paragraph">An input signal can come from a microphone, a radio receiver, or any other source that’s capable of
producing a recordable signal. Some input signals can be recorded immediately, but some must be
processed first. This processing is needed when an input signal is weak, or is out of the frequency
response range of the recorder.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Recording Medium
</h3><p class="paragraph">A recording medium is any material that has the ability to become magnetized, in varying amounts,
in small sections along its entire length. Some examples of this are magnetic tape and magnetic disks.
These are thoroughly discussed in chapter 2 of this module.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Magnetic Heads
</h3><p class="paragraph">Magnetic heads are the heart of the magnetic recording process. They are the transducers that
convert the electrical variations of your input signal into the magnetic variations that are stored on a
recording medium. Without them, magnetic recording isn’t possible.
</p><p class="paragraph">Magnetic heads actually do three different things. They transfer, or record, the signal information
onto the recording medium. They recover, or reproduce, the signal information from the recording
medium. And they remove, or erase, the signal information from the recording medium.
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC HEAD CONSTRUCTION.—A magnetic head is a magnetic core wrapped with a
coil of very thin wire (see figure 1-4). The core material is usually shaped like the letter C, and is made
from either iron or ceramic-ferrite material. The number of turns of wire placed on the core depends on
the purpose of that specific head. The gap in the core is called a head gap. It's here that magnetic
recording actually takes place. We'll go into more detail of magnetic head construction in chapter 3.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC HEAD OPERATION.—Whether you're recording on magnetic tapes or disks, all
magnetic heads operate the same way. When an electric current passes through the coil of a magnetic
head, magnetic field lines associated with the electric current follow paths through the core material.
When the magnetic fields get to the head gap, some of them spread outside the core to form a fringing
field. When a recording medium is passed through this fringing field, it is magnetized in relation to the
electric current. This is called magnetic recording. Figure 1-4 illustrates this process.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-6. What three things are required to perform magnetic recording?
 Q-7. What is the meaning of the term recording medium as it pertains to magnetic recording?
 Q-8. What are the three functions of the magnetic heads on a magnetic recording device?
</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY
</h1><p class="paragraph">This chapter briefly covered the historical development of magnetic recording principles and
devices. The following is a summary of important points in the chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">The BEST MAGNETIC RECORDING is one that produces an output signal that is identical to the
input signal. However, a step in the magnetic curve causes the output signal to be distorted.
</p><p class="paragraph">In 1907, DC BIAS was added to the input signal to remove the distortion in the output signal. But
the dc bias caused a weak output signal with a poor SNR. Around 1925, the NRL used AC BIAS to
reproduce a stronger output signal and greatly improve the SNR.
</p><p class="paragraph">To perform magnetic recording, you need (1) an INPUT SIGNAL, (2) a RECORDING MEDIUM,
and (3) a MAGNETIC HEAD.
</p><p class="paragraph">A RECORDING MEDIUM is any material that can become magnetized in varying amounts (such
as magnetic tape and disks).
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC HEADS are used to (1) record the signal onto the recording medium, (2) reproduce
the signal from the recording medium, and (3) erase the signal from the recording medium.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

 A-1. Because a step in the magnetism curve where it crosses the zero point and changes polarity causes
</p><p class="paragraph">the output signal to be distorted. See figure 1-1.
 A-2. The dc bias moves the input signal away from the step in the magnetism curve. This prevents the
</p><p class="paragraph">input signal from crossing the zero-point of the magnetism curve. See figure 1-2.
 A-3. With dc bias, the SNR is poor because only a small portion of the magnetism curve is straight

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BASE-MATERIAL-2-2-">BASE MATERIAL
</h2><p class="paragraph">The base material for magnetic tape is made of either plastic or metal. Plastic tape is used more than
metal tape because it’s very flexible, it resists mildew and fungus, and it’s very stable at high temperatures
and humidity.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OXIDE-COATING-2-2-">OXIDE COATING
</h2><p class="paragraph">Oxide particles that can be magnetized are coated onto the base material. The most common
magnetic particles used are either gamma ferric oxide or chromium dioxide. It’s very important that these
magnetic particles are uniform in size. If they’re not, the tape’s surface will be abrasive and will reduce the
life of the recorder’s magnetic heads.
</p><p class="paragraph">An ideal magnetic particle is needle-shaped. It’s actual size depends on the frequency of the signal to
be recorded. Generally, long particles are used to record long wavelength signals (low-frequency signals),
and short particles are used to record short wavelength signals (high-frequency signals).
GLUE
</p><p class="paragraph">The glue used to bond the oxide particles to the base material is usually an organic resin. It must be
strong enough to hold the oxide particles to the base material, yet be flexible enough not to peel or crack.

magnetic tape is used to record, store, and reproduce audio and instrumentation type signals. These
signals are usually in a frequency band from very-low frequency (VLF) to 2.5 MHz. Digital magnetic
tape is used to record, store, and reproduce computer programs and data. It’s base material thickness is
about 50 percent thicker than analog magnetic tape. This allows the digital tape to withstand the more
strenuous starts and stops associated with digital magnetic recorder search, read, and write functions.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Digital magnetic tape is also held to much stricter quality control standards. It’s important not to
have any blemishes or coating flaws on the tape’s surface. Because, if you lost one digital data bit, your
computer program or data would be bad. In contrast, losing one microsecond of an analog signal is not
nearly as critical.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TAPE-ERRORS-AND-THEIR-EFFECTS-2-3-">TAPE ERRORS AND THEIR EFFECTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Four types of tape errors that will degrade the performance of a magnetic recording system are signal
dropout, noise, skew, and level (signal amplitude changes).
DROPOUT ERRORS
</p><p class="paragraph">Signal dropout is the most common and the most serious type of tape error. It’s a temporary, sharp
drop (50% or more) in signal strength caused by either contaminates on the magnetic tape or by missing
oxide coating on part of the tape.
</p><p class="paragraph">During recording and playback, the oxide particles on the tape can flake off and stick to the
recorder’s guides, rollers, and heads. After collecting for awhile, the oxide deposits (now oxide lumps)
break loose and stick to the magnetic tape. As the tape with the lumps passes over the head, the lumps get
between the tape and the head and lift the tape away from the head. This causes the signal dropouts.
Although oxide lumps cause most signal dropouts, remember that any contaminate (such as dust, lint or
oil) that gets between the tape and the head can cause signal dropouts.
NOISE ERRORS
</p><p class="paragraph">Noise errors are unwanted signals that appear when no signal should appear. They’re usually caused
by a cut or a scratch on the magnetic tape. It’s the lack of oxide particles at the cut or the scratch that
causes the noise error.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SKEW-ERRORS-2-3-">SKEW ERRORS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Skew errors only occur on multi-track magnetic tape recorders. The term skew describes the time
differences that occur between individual tracks of a single magnetic head when the multi-track tape isn’t
properly aligned with the magnetic head.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two types of skew errors: fixed and dynamic. Fixed skew happens when properly aligned
magnetic tape passes an improperly aligned magnetic head. Dynamic skew happens when misaligned tape
passes a properly aligned head. This type of skew is usually caused by one or more of the following:
</p><p class="paragraph">• A misaligned or worn-out tape transport system.
</p><p class="paragraph">• A stretched or warped magnetic tape.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">• A magnetic tape that is improperly wound on a reel.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LEVEL-ERRORS-2-4-">LEVEL ERRORS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Magnetic tape is manufactured to have a specified output signal level (plus or minus some degree of
error). Level errors happen when the actual output signal level either drops or rises to a level outside the
expected range. For example, if a magnetic tape is rated for 10 volts ( +/- 10%), any output signal level
below 9 volts or above 11 volts is a level error. Level errors are caused by an uneven oxide coating on the
magnetic tape. This can come from either the original manufacturing process or from normal wear and
tear.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some causes of level errors are permanent and cannot be removed by any means. For example, a
crease in the tape, a hole in the oxide, or a damaged edge. Other causes of level errors are removable and
may be cleaned off the tape. For example, oxide flakes or clumps, metallic particles, or dirt are
removable.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUSES-OF-MAGNETIC-TAPE-FAILURE-2-4-">CAUSES OF MAGNETIC TAPE FAILURE
</h2><p class="paragraph">Tape failure happens when a magnetic tape’s performance degrades to a point where it’s no longer
usable. The exact point where failure occurs will vary, depending on the type of tape and how it is used.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are four main causes for tape failure:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Normal wear (natural causes)
2. Accidental damage
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Environmental damage
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Winding errors
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-NORMAL-WEAR-2-4-">NORMAL WEAR
</h2><p class="paragraph">Normal wear occurs because the tape must come in contact with fixed surfaces, such as a recorder’s
magnetic heads, rollers, and guides. Over time, this repeated contact with the fixed surfaces causes
excessive dropout errors and makes the tape unusable.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ACCIDENTAL-DAMAGE-2-5-">ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE
</h2><p class="paragraph">Accidental tape damage that causes tape failure is any damage that wouldn’t normally occur under
ideal operating and handling conditions. It can be caused by either a human operator or the tape recorder
itself. Accidental tape damage caused by human operators can range from accidentally dropping a reel of
magnetic tape to improperly threading a magnetic tape recorder. Accidental tape damage caused by
recording equipment can occur if the recorder is poorly designed or if the tape transport mechanism is
adjusted improperly.
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE
</p><p class="paragraph">The negative effect of environmental extremes on tape can also cause tape failure. Magnetic tape is
very flexible and can be used in a wide range of environmental conditions. It’s designed for use in a
temperature range of about 2 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 20 to 55 degrees Celsius), and in a relative
humidity range of about 10 to 95%. Of course, these numbers are the extreme. Ideally, magnetic tape
should be used and stored at a temperature of about 60 to 80º F (room temperature), and in a relative
humidity of about 40 to 60%.
</p><p class="paragraph">Large changes from the ideal relative humidity cause tape to expand or contract and thus affect the
uniformity of a tape's oxide coating. High relative humidity causes the tape to stretch and increases the
tape's friction. The increased friction causes increased head wear, head clog by oxide particles, and
head-to-tape sticking. Low relative humidity encourages oxide shedding and increases static build-up on
tape surfaces, causing the tape to collect airborne contaminants.
</p><p class="paragraph">The effects of exceeding the ideal temperature and humidity ranges described above can cause the
following environmental damage to magnetic tape: tape deformation, oxide shedding, head-to-tape
sticking, layer-to-layer sticking, dirt build-up, and excessive tape and head wear.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tape Deformation
</h3><p class="paragraph">Magnetic tapes are wound onto tape reels with tension applied. This tension causes great layer-to-
layer pressure within the reel pack. Changes in temperature and humidity can cause the backing material
to expand or contract, creating even more pressure. All of this pressure causes the tape to become
deformed or warped.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Oxide Shedding
</h3><p class="paragraph">At temperatures above 130º F, a tape's oxide coating tends to become soft. At temperatures below
2º F, the oxide coating tends to be brittle. In both cases, the oxide coating will shed, flake off, or
otherwise become separated from the base material. These free pieces of oxide will then stick to parts of
the tape transport, to the magnetic heads, or back onto the tape and cause dropout or level errors.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Head-to-Tape Sticking
</h3><p class="paragraph">At higher temperatures, the tape binder glue can soften to the point where it will stick to the
recorder's magnetic head. This head-to-tape sticking causes jerky tape motion.
Layer-to-Layer Adhesion
</p><p class="paragraph">When reels of magnetic tape are stored at higher temperatures, the tape's binder glue may melt and
cause the layers of tape to stick to one another. In very severe cases, layer-to-layer adhesion can separate
the oxide coating from the base material and completely destroy a tape.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Dirt Build-up
</h3><p class="paragraph">Dirt build-up happens when the relative humidity level is less than 10%. The low humidity causes
static electricity that attracts dirt and dust which builds up on the magnetic tape and other parts of the
magnetic tape recorder.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Excessive Tape and Head Wear
</h3><p class="paragraph">When the relative humidity is more than 95%, the high humidity causes increased friction as the tape
passes over the heads. This, in turn, causes excessive tape and head wear.

recorder that could cause environmental damage?
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-21. How does relative humidity over 95% cause excessive tape and head wear?
WINDING ERRORS
</p><p class="paragraph">Winding errors are another cause of tape failure. They happen when improper winding practices
create an excessive or uneven force as the tape is being wound onto a tape reel. The form taken by the
tape after it is wound onto the reel is called the tape pack. Winding errors can cause a deformed tape pack
that will prevent good head-to-tape contact.
</p><p class="paragraph">In most cases, a deformed tape pack can be fixed simply by rewinding it onto another reel at the
proper tension and at the right temperature and humidity. The four most common types of tape pack
deformation are:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Cinching
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Pack-slip
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Spoking</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">4. Windowing
</p><h3 class="subsection">Cinching
</h3><p class="paragraph">Cinching happens when a tape reel is stopped too quickly. The sudden stop causes the outer layers of
magnetic tape to continue to spin after the inner layers have stopped. This causes any loosely wound tape
within the pack to unwind and pile up. Figure 2-2 shows an example of a cinched tape pack (note the
complete foldover of one tape strand).
</p><h3 class="subsection">Pack Slip
</h3><p class="paragraph">Pack slip happens when the tape is loosely wound on the reel and is exposed to excessive vibration
or too much heat. This causes the tape to shift (side-to-side), causing steps in the tape pack. When a tape
reel with pack slip is used, the magnetic tape will unwind unevenly and rub against the sides of the tape
reel or the recorder’s tape guides. This can damage the magnetic tape and cause oxide shedding. Figure
2-3 shows an example of pack slip.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Spoking
</h3><p class="paragraph">Spoking happens when magnetic tape is wound onto the tape reel with the tension increasing toward
the end of the winding. The higher tension on the outside of the tape pack causes the inner pack to buckle
and deform. Spoking is also caused by the uneven pressures created when a tape is wound on a reel that
has a distorted hub, or when the tape is wound over a small particle that is deposited on the hub. Figure
2-4 shows a spoked tape pack.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Windowing
</h3><p class="paragraph">Windows are voids or see-through air gaps in the tape winding. They happen when magnetic tape is
loosely wound onto a tape reel, and especially when the loosely wound reel is later exposed to extreme
heat or humidity. Figure 2-5 shows a windowed tape pack.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

for either analog or digital recording. Tape cartridges are normally used only for digital recording.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TAPE-REELS-2-9-">TAPE REELS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Tape reels are used on magnetic recorders that use a manually loaded tape supply reel and a separate
take-up reel. A reel’s purpose is to protect the magnetic tape from damage and contamination. It can be
made of plastic, metal, or glass. A reel has two parts, the hub and the flanges.
</p><p class="paragraph">A tape reel is designed to hold magnetic tape on its hub without letting the magnetic tape touch the
sides of the flanges. Contrary to popular belief, the flanges are not designed to guide the magnetic tape
onto the tape reel.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">One advantage of magnetic tape is that you can erase what you’ve previously recorded, and record
on the same tape again and again. The erasing is done by demagnetizing the magnetic tape. You
demagnetize a magnetic tape by exposing it to a gradually decreasing ac (alternating current) magnetic
field. There are two ways to do this: (1) with an erase head that’s mounted on the magnetic recorder, or
(2) with a separate tape degausser.
ERASE HEADS
</p><p class="paragraph">A magnetic recorder’s erase head erases magnetic tape by saturating it with an ac signal that’s higher
in frequency than the frequency range of the recorder itself. This method of erasing a tape works well in
some cases, but it’s not the best way because:
</p><p class="paragraph">• It’s slow; the tape must be run through the recorder to be erased.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

slowly and steadily in and out of an intense ac magnetic field. This type of degausser erases a tape very
well. Some automatic degaussers are made specifically for tape reels, and some are made for both tape
reels and tape cartridges. Figure 2-7 shows a typical automatic degausser.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Manual Tape Degausser
</h3><p class="paragraph">Both manual and automatic tape degaussers use the same electronic principles for erasing magnetic

</p><p class="paragraph">When magnetic tape recordings are ruined, the cause is usually poor handling, improper storage, or
shipping damage. If you want your tape recordings to last a long time, you need to know how to properly
handle, store, and ship magnetic tape.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HANDLING-MAGNETIC-TAPE-2-13-">HANDLING MAGNETIC TAPE
</h2><p class="paragraph">A magnetic tape reel or cartridge should always be in one of two places, either mounted on a tape
recorder or in its storage container. When you handle magnetic tape, follow these rules:
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO use extreme care when handling magnetic tape. Careless handling can damage magnetic tape,
tape reels, and tape cartridges. Always hold a tape reel by the hub, NEVER by the flanges, and
NEVER handle or touch the working tape surface.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT let the magnetic tape trail on the floor. Even though the end of the tape may not have
data stored on it, it can pick up dirt and dust that ends up on the recorder.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO clean your hands before handling magnetic tape. You can contaminate magnetic tape with
dirt and oils from dirty hands.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO mount tape reels and cartridges properly. Improperly seated tape reels can cause unnecessary
wear and tear on the magnetic tape.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO replace any warped take-up reels, as they can damage magnetic tape.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO keep the magnetic recorder and its take-up reel clean. Magnetic tape can pick up dirt and dust
from the recorder itself.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT use the top of a magnetic recorder as a work area. This can expose the magnetic tape to
dirt, excessive heat, and stray magnetic fields.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT allow eating, drinking, or smoking in areas where magnetic tape or devices are exposed.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-STORING-MAGNETIC-TAPE-2-13-">STORING MAGNETIC TAPE
</h2><p class="paragraph">Most magnetic tape reels and cartridges spend a lot of time in storage. It’s very important that you
protect the stored tape from physical damage and the damaging effects of contamination and temperature
and humidity extremes. If you don’t, damage to the tape pack such as oxide shedding, layer-to-layer
sticking, and tape deformation can happen. To protect magnetic tape from damage during storage, follow
these rules:
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO make sure that magnetic tape is wound properly on the reel hub and at the proper tension.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always store tape reels vertically. DO NOT lay them on their side.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO maintain a proper environment. Keep the storage area clean, and at a 60 to 80F degree
temperature and a 40 to 60% relative humidity.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT store magnetic tapes near any equipment that generates stray magnetic fields.

</h2><p class="paragraph">There may be times when you are asked to package magnetic tape reels or tape cartridges for
shipment. If you want the tape to arrive in good condition, you must pack it properly to protect it from
damage. The packaging you use must protect the tape reels or cartridges from impact, vibration, and
temperature and humidity changes. Here are some simple rules to follow:
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always package tape reels so that they’re supported by their hub. This prevents any pressure
on the reel’s flanges that might flex the flanges against the tape pack. Figure 2-9 shows a shipping
box that supports the tape reel by the hub.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always use reel bands where available. Reel bands are for placement around the outside edges
of the reel flanges to help prevent the flanges from flexing and damaging the tape.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always ship magnetic reels in a container designed so its normal positioning is with the reels
in a vertical position. This will prevent the tape pack from shifting and damaging the edges of the
magnetic tape.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always package tape cartridges in their shipping cases. Tape cartridges are more durable than
tape reels, but they still need to be protected during shipment.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-30. When magnetic tapes are ruined, what three factors are normally the cause?
 Q-31. What is the correct way to hold a magnetic tape reel?
 Q-32. The take-up reel on your recorder is warped. What should you do to/with the reel?
 Q-33. If magnetic tape is stored in areas with temperature and humidity extremes, what are three types
</p><p class="paragraph">of tape damage that may occur?
 Q-34. List four rules you should follow when storing magnetic tape to protect it from damage.
 Q-35. When packaging tape reels or cartridges for shipping, what are four rules you should follow to
</p><p class="paragraph">protect the tape reels from impact and vibration?</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY
</h1><p class="paragraph">Now that you’ve finished chapter 2, you should be able to (1) describe the physical properties of
magnetic tape, (2) recognize the four most common magnetic tape errors, (3) recognize the four causes of
tape failure, (4) describe the two methods for erasing magnetic tape, and (5) use the proper procedures for
handling, storing, and packaging magnetic tape, tape reels, and tape cartridges. The following is a
summary of the important points in this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">The three BASIC MATERIALS used to make magnetic tape are the (1) base material, (2) the oxide
particles, and (3) the binder glue.
</p><p class="paragraph">ANALOG and DIGITAL are the two basic types of magnetic tape in common use.
</p><p class="paragraph">BLEMISHES OR COATING FLAWS ON DIGITAL TAPE can easily ruin the data or the
computer program stored on the tape.
</p><p class="paragraph">SIGNAL DROPOUT, NOISE, SKEW, AND LEVEL are four types of tape errors. Dropout errors
are the most common.
</p><p class="paragraph">OXIDE LUMPS accumulated on the tape cause most dropout errors. Other causes are dust or lint
on the tape, or missing oxide coating on part of the tape.
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC TAPE FAILURE has four main causes: (1) normal wear, (2) accidental damage,
(3) environmental damage, and (4) winding errors.
</p><p class="paragraph">IDEAL TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY RANGES for using and storing magnetic tape are
60 to 80º F and 40 to 60% relative humidity.
</p><p class="paragraph">ENVIRONMENTAL TAPE DAMAGE caused by excessive temperature or humidity includes the
following: (1) tape deformation, (2) oxide shedding, (3) head-to-tape sticking, (4) layer-to-layer sticking,
(5) dirt buildup, and (6) excessive tape and head wear.
</p><p class="paragraph">WINDING ERRORS can cause tape pack deformation. The four most common types are:
(1) cinching, (2) pack slip, (3) spoking, and (4) windowing.
</p><p class="paragraph">The TWO PARTS OF A TAPE REEL are the hub and the flanges. The tape should be wound on
the hub. No part of the tape should be touching the flange sides.
</p><p class="paragraph">ERASE HEADS AND TAPE DEGAUSSERS are two methods for erasing tape. Degaussers are
the fastest and the most reliable.
</p><p class="paragraph">Rules for HANDLING MAGNETIC TAPE are (1) always hold the reel by the hub, not the flanges,
(2) never touch the working tape surface, (3) replace warped or damaged reels, and (4) mount reels and
cartridges properly.
</p><p class="paragraph">Rules for STORING MAGNETIC TAPE are (1) wind tape properly on the reel hub, (2) store tapes
vertically, (3) keep storage area clean and at proper temperature and humidity levels, and (4) store tapes
away from equipment that generates stray magnetic fields.
</p><p class="paragraph">Rules for PACKAGING TAPE FOR SHIPPING are (1) support reels by their hubs, (2) use reel
bands, (3) pack reels in containers vertically, and (4) keep tape cartridges in their shipping cases.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS Q1. THROUGH Q35.
 A-1. 
</p><p class="paragraph">a. Base material.
</p><p class="paragraph">b. Coating of magnetic oxide particles.
c. Glue that bonds the particles to the base.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-2. Plastic tape is used more than metal because it’s more flexible, resists mildew and fungus, and
is very stable at high temperatures and humidity.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-3. Analog magnetic tape.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-4. Digital magnetic tape is for computer programs and data. Its base material is about 50%
thicker. The tape’s surface must not have blemishes or coating flaws because losing even one
digital data bit could ruin the recorded computer program or data.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-5. Signal dropout, noise, skew, and level. Dropout is the most common.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-6. Dropouts are temporary, sharp drops (50% or more) in signal strength. They’re caused by
contaminates that lift the tape away from the magnetic head, or when magnetic oxide coating is
missing on part of the tape.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-7. Oxide particles that get onto the magnetic tape.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-8. Signal dropout errors and level errors. The dust and lint on the reel will eventually get onto the
tape where it can get between the tape and the recorder’s heads.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-9. Noise error is usually caused by a cut or a scratch on the magnetic tape.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-10. Skew means there are time differences between the individual tracks of a multi-track recorder’s
magnetic head. It happens when the tape isn’t properly aligned with the head. Fixed skew
happens when the tape passes over an improperly aligned magnetic head.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-11. The actual output signal level of the tape exceeds the manufacturer’s specified range for the
output signal level (+ / -  10%).  It’s caused by an uneven oxide coating on the tape due to worn
tape or defective manufacture.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-12. Tape’s performance degrades to a point where it’s no longer usable.
 A-13. Normal wear, accidental damage, environmental damage, and winding errors.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-14. Repeated contact with a recorder’s fixed surfaces such as magnetic heads, tape rollers, and tape
guides.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-15. 
</p><p class="paragraph">a. Improperly adjusted tape transport mechanism.
b. Dropping a reel of tape.
c. Improperly threading tape.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> A-16. Ideally, use and store tape at 60 to 80º F and at 40 to 60% relative humidity.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-17. Tape deformation, oxide shedding, head-to-tape sticking, layer-to-layer sticking, dirt build-up,
and excessive tape and head wear.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-18. Oxide shedding. At temperatures above 130º F, oxide coating becomes soft and sheds.
 A-19. Head-to-tape sticking and layer-to-layer adhesion.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-20. Dirt build-up caused by static electricity.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-21. High humidity causes increased friction as the tape passes over the heads.
 A-22. Cinching, pack slip, spoking, and windowing.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-23. The tape is stopped too quickly when winding or rewinding.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-24. Pack slip. It's caused by loosely wound tape on a reel that is exposed to excessive vibration or
heat. The vibration or heat causes the tape to shift, causing steps in the tape pack. The uneven
tape will then rub against the reel's sides and the recorder's tape guides.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-25. 
</p><p class="paragraph">a. Reel has a distorted hub,
</p><p class="paragraph">b. tape wound over small particle deposited on hub, and
</p><p class="paragraph">c. tape wound on reel with tension increasing toward end of winding.
 A-26. Tape is loosely wound on reel.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-27. No. The reel is designed to hold the tape on its hub without letting the tape touch the sides of the
flanges.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-28. Using an erase head is slow, and it may not completely erase the tape.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-29. Using a magnetic tape degausser.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-30. Poor handling, improper storage, or shipping damage.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-31. Always hold reel by the hub, never by the flanges. Never touch the working tape surface.
 A-32. Always replace a warped reel.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-33. Oxide shedding, layer-to-layer sticking, and tape deformation.
 A-34. 
</p><p class="paragraph">a. Make sure the tape is wound properly on the reel hub,
</p><p class="paragraph">b. store tapes vertically,
</p><p class="paragraph">c. keep storage area at right temperature and humidity,
</p><p class="paragraph">d. store away from equipment that generates stray magnetic fields.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MAGNETIC-TAPE-RECORDER-HEADS-3-1-">MAGNETIC TAPE RECORDER HEADS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Magnetic tape recorder heads are the heart of magnetic tape recording, because it's the magnetic 
heads (as we'll call them in this chapter) that actually: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Record signal or data information onto magnetic tape 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Reproduce (play back) signal or data information from magnetic tape 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Erase any signal or data off of magnetic tape 
</p><p class="paragraph">To do these things, a magnetic tape recorder can have up to three different heads installed: one head 
for recording, one for reproducing, and one for erasing. Some magnetic tape recorders will use the same 
head for both recording and reproducing. Figure 3-1 shows a typical multitrack magnetic head.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MAGNETIC-HEAD-CONSTRUCTION-3-2-">MAGNETIC HEAD CONSTRUCTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Magnetic head construction is basically the same for all magnetic heads. They're all made up of a 
magnetic core wrapped with a coil of very thin wire. But, there's where the similarity ends. From here on, 
each magnetic head is built to perform a specific job. Will the head be used on a single track recorder? 
Will it be used on a multitrack recorder? Will it be a record head or a reproduce head? Or, will it be an 
erase head? What frequency will it be recording and/or reproducing? The answers to these questions will 
determine the final construction of a magnetic head. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-2 shows the construction of a typical multitrack magnetic head. Magnetic cores are wound 
with very thin wire, cemented together, and placed inside a half-bracket. A tip piece is then placed on top 
of the ferrite core, and the two half-brackets are assembled together. It's during this final assembly 
process that the headgap and the resulting frequency response of the magnetic head are determined. After 
some final contouring to give the magnetic head its curved face, it's ready for use.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Record and Reproduce Heads 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Record and reproduce heads convert and transfer electrical signals onto and off of magnetic tape. 
The maximum frequency these heads can transfer depends on the size of the headgap and the speed of the 
magnetic tape (we'll discuss speed in the next chapter). Most record and reproduce heads are in one of 
these three general bandwidth categories: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Narrowband—100 Hz to 100 kHz 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Intermediate band—100 Hz to 500 kHz 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Wideband—400 Hz to 2 mHz 
</p><p class="paragraph">The only physical difference between a record head and a reproduce head is in the number of turns 
of wire on the core. A reproduce head will have more turns than a record head. This is because reproduce 
heads must be able to recover low-level signals from magnetic tape. The extra turns of wire allow the 
reproduce head to output the highest level possible and at a good signal-to-noise level. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Record heads are always placed before reproduce heads on magnetic tape recorders. This allows you 
to monitor signals that you're recording. Figure 3-3 shows the placement of record and reproduce heads. 
Figure 3-4 shows some of the typical track arrangements used.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Erase Heads 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Erase heads transfer a signal to the magnetic tape that causes the magnetic particles to assume a 
neutralized or erased state. To do this, a high current signal that is 3 to 5 times higher in frequency than 
the maximum frequency response of the record and reproduce heads is used. In some audio recorders, a 
simple direct current (dc) voltage is used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Erase heads are always placed before the record and the reproduce heads on tape recorders. This 
allows you to erase the magnetic tape before it's recorded on. Figure 3-3 shows the placement of erase 
heads.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MAGNETIC-HEAD-MAINTENANCE-3-5-">MAGNETIC HEAD MAINTENANCE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">It's very important to regularly maintain magnetic heads. If you do, you'll greatly reduce the chance 
of getting a poor recording or playback. Regular preventive maintenance will also increase the life of the 
magnetic heads. There are two things you must do to properly maintain magnetic heads: (1) keep them 
clean, and (2) keep them demagnetized. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Cleaning Magnetic Heads 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Through use, magnetic heads pick up dirt, dust, lint, and oxide particles from the magnetic tape. 
These particles collect on the magnetic head and, if left unchecked, could cause signal dropout errors that 
degrade the quality of recording and playback. To keep magnetic heads clean, regularly clean them with a 
cotton-tipped applicator soaked in either isopropyl alcohol or in a magnetic head cleaner recommended by 
the recorder's manufacturer. A good rule of thumb is to clean the heads each time you change a tape reel 
or cartridge. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Demagnetizing Magnetic Heads 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Magnetic heads can become magnetized from many sources. It could happen 
</p><h3 class="subsection">• during ac power losses, 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• during testing or alignment, 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• because of stray magnetic fields, 
</h3><p class="paragraph">• from normal use. 
</p><p class="paragraph">No matter the cause, magnetized magnetic heads degrade the quality of the magnetic recording or 
playback. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To demagnetize magnetic heads, you'll use a hand-held degausser. It could be like the one shown in 
figure 3-5, or like the manual degausser shown in the previous chapter. No matter how they look, they all 
generate an ac magnetic field that demagnetizes the metal parts of a magnetic head. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

magnetic tape. Here are the basic steps: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Remove the tape (reel or cartridge) from the magnetic recorder. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Holding the degausser an arm's length away from the magnetic head, energize the degausser. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Slowly bring the degausser closer and closer to the magnetic head. Don't touch the head with 
the degausser. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Move the degausser back and forth across the head for 15 to 30 seconds. Figure 3-6 shows how 
this looks. 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. Slowly move the degausser away from the magnetic head. When the degausser is an arm's length 
away, de-energize it. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TAPE-REELING-SYSTEMS-4-2-">TAPE REELING SYSTEMS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A basic magnetic recorder tape reeling system (figure 4-1) has one supply reel and one take-up reel. 
Its job is to move the magnetic tape from one reel to the other. When this happens, four things occur: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. The supply reel feeds out magnetic tape at a constant tension. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The tape passes the magnetic heads in a straight line. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. The take-up reel accepts the magnetic tape at a constant tension. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Both the supply and take-up reels start and stop smoothly while maintaining the proper tape 
tension. 
</p><p class="paragraph">These four things must happen, or the magnetic tape could be damaged. Three of the most 
commonly used tape reeling systems are (1) take-up control, (2) two-motor reeling, and (3) tape 
buffering. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TAKE-UP-CONTROL-REELING-SYSTEMS-4-2-">TAKE-UP CONTROL REELING SYSTEMS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">This system uses a motorized take-up reel which pulls the magnetic tape off of a free-spooling 
supply reel. It maintains tape tension by using mechanical drag on the supply reel. As you might guess, 
this method has its disadvantages. It only works in one direction, and the tape tension doesn't remain 
constant throughout the reel. As the supply reel gives out tape, the tape tension varies. Uneven tape 
tension can cause stretched tape, poorly wound tape reels, and tape damage during starts and stops. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TWO-MOTOR-REELING-SYSTEMS-4-2-">TWO-MOTOR REELING SYSTEMS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">To overcome the problems of take-up control reeling systems, designers added a motor to the supply 
reel. By using two motors, the magnetic tape direction can be forward or reverse. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Two-motor reeling configurations usually use dc (direct current) motors, instead of ac (alternating 
current) motors, because dc motors run smoother and are easier to control. To help control tape tension, a 
small hold-back voltage is added to the motor for the supply reel. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Unfortunately, two-motor reeling systems do not properly control tape tension during starts and 
stops. Something called tape buffering must be added. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TAPE-BUFFERING-REELING-SYSTEMS-4-3-">TAPE BUFFERING REELING SYSTEMS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Controlling a recorder's tape tension during starts and stops is a big problem. Tape buffering 
overcomes this problem by regulating the tape reel speed and by protecting against changes in tape 
tension. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Every manufacturer of high-quality, high performance magnetic tape recorders uses some sort of 
tape buffering. It's especially important in magnetic recorders that operate at many different speeds, 
where precise tape tension must be maintained. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-2 shows the relationship between the tape reeling system and the tape buffering system. As 
you can see, the speed at which a tape reel will give up or take up magnetic tape is controlled by its 
respective speed control servo. Feedback from the supply and take-up buffers tells the servo to speed up 
or slow down. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two basic types of reeling system buffers: (1) spring-tension, and (2) vacuum-column. 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Spring-tension buffering systems use an electro-mechanical device to sense changes in tape 
tension. These changes are feedback that the speed control servo needs to adjust the speed of the tape 
reels. Figures 4-3 and 4-4 show two of the more common arrangements for spring-tension buffers. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the speed control servos that control tape reel speed. But, as shown in figure 4-5, the vacuum-column 
buffer system uses a vacuum chamber instead of a spring to hold a length of magnetic tape as slack during 
tape recorder starts and stops. An electronic sensor in the vacuum chamber helps to control how much 
tape is in the buffer. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

during operation. To do this, tape reeling systems use tape guides. Tape guides come in two designs, fixed 
and rotary. Both of these are shown in figure 4-6. Each type of tape guide has its drawbacks. Fixed tape 
guides produce a lot more friction, and rotary tape guides are more likely to cause errors because of their 
moving parts.

this configuration.

tape is pulled by sandwiching it between a single capstan and a pinch roller. As the capstan turns, the 
friction between it and the pinch roller pulls the tape across the magnetic heads. The magnetic tape is held 
against the magnetic heads by using tape guides. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

tape tension will vary. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CLOSED-LOOP-CAPSTAN-DRIVE-4-8-">CLOSED-LOOP CAPSTAN DRIVE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Closed-loop capstan drive tape transports were designed to overcome the drawbacks of the open-
loop drive design. They use more than one capstan and/or pinch roller to clamp the magnetic tape in the 
area around the magnetic heads. This keeps tape tension constant and improves the quality of the 
recording or the playback. Figure 4-10 shows the basic arrangement of the closed-loop capstan drive.

(2) dual-motors dual capstans, and (3) peripheral drive capstans. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Differential Velocity Capstans 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-11 shows a differential velocity capstan. In this design, the take-up capstan is made a little 
larger than the supply capstan. This causes the take-up capstan to pull the tape away from the heads 
slightly faster than the supply capstan feeds the tape to the heads. The result is a constant tape tension in 
the area around the magnetic heads. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Both capstans are turned by a single motor which is coupled to the capstan pulleys by a belt. This 
arrangement is very efficient in one direction, but, unfortunately, differential velocity capstans don't work 
in reverse.  If you reversed the tape direction, a negative tension would occur, and the tape would bunch 
up in the area around the magnetic heads. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Dual-Motors Dual Capstans 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-12 shows a dual-motor dual capstan drive. In this design, each capstan is driven by its own 
motor. Tape tension is maintained by slowing down one of the motors. When reverse tape motion is 
needed, the opposite motor is slowed down. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY 
</h1><p class="paragraph">Now that you've finished chapter 4, you should be able to describe magnetic tape transport systems 
in terms of their operating characteristics, parts, and preventive maintenance requirements. The following 
is a summary of the important points in this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A MAGNETIC TAPE RECORDER TRANSPORT has four basic parts: (1) tape reeling system, 
(2) tape speed control system, (3) electronic subsystem, and (4) basic enclosure. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The TAPE REELING SYSTEM must move the tape in a straight line at a constant tension, and it 
must start and stop smoothly while maintaining the proper tension. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Three of the MOST COMMON REELING SYSTEMS are (1) take-up control, (2) two-motor 
reeling, and (3) tape buffering. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The two types of TAPE TRANSPORT CONFIGURATIONS are (1) open-loop capstan drive and 
(2) closed-loop capstan drive. The open-loop type works in only one direction, and the tape tension can 
vary. The closed-loop type keeps the tape tension constant. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Three types of CLOSED-LOOP CAPSTAN DRIVES are (1) differential velocity capstans, 
(2) dual-motors dual capstans, and (3) peripheral drive capstans. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The CAPSTAN SPEED CONTROL component of a tape transport keeps the capstan turning at the 
correct operating speed and at a constant speed. It has these six parts: (1) precision frequency source, 
(2) speed select network, (3) capstan speed motor, (4) comparison network, (5) speed correction circuit, 
and (6) capstan motor drive circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You should CLEAN magnetic tape transports with isopropyl alcohol, cotton swabs, and lint free 
cloths and DEMAGNETIZE them using a hand-held degausser.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="answer">A4. The two-motor configuration runs in both directions and a holdback voltage helps control tape 
tension, but it does not properly control tape tension during starts and stops.

</p><p class="answer">A6.  
</p><p class="paragraph">a. Spring-tension buffering systems. 
</p><p class="paragraph">b. Vacuum-column buffering systems. 
</p><p class="answer">A7. They keep the tape straight with respect to both the supply and take-up reels and the magnetic 
heads. 
</p><p class="answer">A8.  
</p><p class="paragraph">a. Only operates in one direction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">b. The tape tension and head-to-tape contact can vary. 
</p><p class="answer">A9. Closed loop capstan drive transports use more than one capstan to clamp the tape in the area 
around the magnetic head. 
</p><p class="answer">A10.  
</p><p class="paragraph">a. Differential velocity capstans. 
</p><p class="paragraph">b. Dual motors dual capstans. 
</p><p class="paragraph">c. Peripheral drive capstans. 
</p><p class="answer">A11. The supply capstan is slightly larger than the take-up capstan. This causes the take-up capstan to 
pull the tape slightly faster than the supply capstan feeds the tape. 
</p><p class="answer">A12. Each capstan is driven by its own motor. It maintains tape tension by slowing down one of the 
motors. When the tape motion is reversed, the opposite motor is slowed down. 
</p><p class="answer">A13. Makes sure the capstan turns at the right speed and at a constant speed. 
</p><p class="answer">A14. Capstan speed monitor.

called amplitude modulation (AM) electronics. The second way is frequency modulation (FM). Even
though direct record and reproduce circuits are much different from FM record and reproduce electronics,
they both share the same two very important jobs. They both must:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Take an input signal, process it as needed, and then send it to the record magnetic head for
reproduction.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Take the reproduced signal from the reproduce magnetic head, process it as needed, and output it

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DIRECT-RECORD-ELECTRONICS-5-1-">DIRECT RECORD ELECTRONICS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Direct record electronics record input signals onto magnetic media just as the signals appeared at the
recorder’s input. The only processing an input signal receives is the adding of a bias signal. The added
bias signal makes sure the signal stays away from the steps of the magnetism curve. Figure 5-1 shows a
basic block diagram of a recorder’s direct record electronics.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

summing network. It also matches the impedance between the source of the input signal and the
magnetic tape recorder.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Bias source. This circuit generates the high-frequency bias signal and sends it to the summing

</p><p class="paragraph">1. Pre-amplifier circuit. This circuit takes the very weak reproduced signal from the reproduce head
and (a) amplifies the signal, (b) removes any bias signal that was used during the recording
process, and (c) sends the signal to the equalization and phase correction circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Equalization and phase correction circuit. This circuit takes the pre-amplified signal and fixes any
frequency response problems that the reproduce magnetic head may have caused. To better
understand this, look at the voltage versus frequency response graph in figure 5-3. The top of the
graph shows the input signal that comes from the pre-amplifier and the bottom shows the
equalization signal generated by the equalization circuit. In the top part of the graph, note how the
output voltage level varies as the frequency of the signal varies. This isn’t good. A good output
voltage level is one that remains constant as the frequency changes. The equalization signal
corrects this problem. Notice that when the input signal and the equalization signal are combined
they cancel each other out. This allows a nice flat (voltage versus frequency) output signal to go
to the output amplifier circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Output amplifier circuit. This circuit takes the signal from the equalization and phase correction
circuit and amplifies it for output. It also matches the magnetic recorder’s impedance to the output
device that is used for listening or recording.

</h2><p class="paragraph">FM record electronics process signals to be recorded differently than direct record electronics.
Instead of recording the input signal just as it appears at the recorder’s input, FM record electronics use
the input signal to vary (modulate) the carrier frequency of a record oscillator. The frequency modulated
output signal of the record oscillator then becomes the signal that’s actually recorded onto the magnetic
media. Figure 5-4 shows a block diagram of the FM record electronics.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">FM record electronics consist of three main parts:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Input pre-amplifier circuit. This circuit does two things: (a) it serves as an impedance matcher
between the signal source and the magnetic recorder, and (b) it pre-amplifies the input signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Record oscillator circuit. This circuit generates a carrier signal onto which the input signal will be
modulated. The input signal is used to vary (frequency modulate) the carrier signal. This is how
the input signal gets frequency modulated onto the carrier signal. The output of this circuit is the
frequency-modulated carrier signal. The center frequency of the carrier depends on two things:
(a) the bandwidth of the signal you’re recording, and (b) the media onto which you’re recording.
For magnetic tape, the carrier frequency can be as low as 1.688 kHz for an operating tape speed
of 1-7/8 inches per second, and as high as 900 kHz for 120 inches per second.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Head driver circuit. This circuit takes the frequency-modulated output from the record oscillator
circuit, amplifies it, and sends it to the magnetic head for recording. The output level of this
circuit is set to be just below the magnetic saturation point of the magnetic media.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SIGNAL-TO-NOISE-RATIO-6-2-">SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO
</h2><p class="paragraph">Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is the first magnetic tape recorder specification we’ll describe. It’s one of
the most important specifications of a magnetic tape recorder.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SIGNAL-TO-NOISE-RATIO-DEFINITION-6-2-">SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO DEFINITION
</h2><p class="paragraph">The SNR is the ratio of the normal signal level to the magnetic tape recorder’s own noise level. It’s
measured in decibels (dB). In other words, the higher the SNR of a magnetic tape recorder, the wider the
range of input signals it can properly record and reproduce.
</p><p class="paragraph">The noise part of the signal-to-noise ratio is generated in the magnetic tape recorder itself. Although
noise can be generated by almost any part of the magnetic tape recorder, it’s usually generated by either
the magnetic heads or the magnetic tape.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SIGNAL-TO-NOISE-RATIO-MEASUREMENT-6-2-">SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO MEASUREMENT
</h2><p class="paragraph">You can measure the SNR with a vacuum tube voltmeter (VTVM) and a signal generator. The
equipment set up for measuring the SNR is shown in figure 6-1. After equipment setup, measure the SNR
as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Set the signal generator to inject a test signal into the tape recorder. The technical manual for the
tape recorder you’re testing will tell you how to set up the signal generator.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. While recording and reproducing, set the output level of the tape recorder’s reproduce electronics
to a level that displays 0-dB reference on the VTVM.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Disconnect the signal generator. The voltage displayed on the VTVM will drop from 0-dB to
some negative dB level. This level is the magnetic tape recorder’s SNR.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">6-3
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two things you should know when reading SNR specifications in technical manuals,
equipment brochures, etc.
</p><p class="paragraph">First, the SNR is stated in three ways. You’ll see it as (1) root-mean-square (RMS) signal-to-RMS
noise, (2) peak-to-peak signal-to-RMS noise, or (3) peak signal-to-RMS noise. If the SNR specification
doesn’t state which way it was measured, you could be mislead. For example, a 25-dB RMS SNR is equal
to a 34-dB peak-to-peak signal-to-RMS noise ratio, or a 28-dB peak signal-to-RMS noise ratio.
</p><p class="paragraph">Second, all SNR specifications should include the record level that was used. Since the SNR varies
directly to the record level, you could be mislead by a SNR that doesn’t include the record level of the test
signal used when the SNR was measured.
</p><p class="paragraph">FREQUENCY RESPONSE
The frequency-response specification of a magnetic tape recorder is sometimes called the bandwidth.
</p><p class="paragraph">A typical frequency-response specification might read within + / -  3 db from 100 Hz to 100 kHz at 60 ips.
This means the magnetic tape recorder is capable of recording all frequencies between 100 Hz and 100
kHz at 60 inches per second (ips) without varying the output amplitude more than 3 dB.
FREQUENCY-RESPONSE DEFINITION
</p><p class="paragraph">Frequency response is the amplitude variation with frequency over a specified bandwidth. Let’s
convert this to plain English. The frequency-response specification of a magnetic tape recorder tells you
the range of frequencies the recorder can effectively record and reproduce. What exactly does the word
effectively mean? That’s hard to say because frequency response varies from recorder to recorder, and
from manufacturer to manufacturer. But a good rule of thumb is that an effective frequency-response
specification tells the lowest and highest frequencies that the recorder can record and reproduce with no
more than + / -  3-dB difference in output amplitude.
FREQUENCY-RESPONSE MEASUREMENT
</p><p class="paragraph">The equipment setup for measuring the frequency response of a magnetic tape recorder is the same
as for measuring the signal-to-noise ratio. It’s shown in figure 6-1. After equipment setup, measure a
recorder’s frequency response as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Set the signal generator to output a test signal. The technical manual for the tape recorder will tell
you how.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Set the recorder’s reproduce electronics output level to a 0-dB reference on the VTVM.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. While recording at a set speed, vary the frequency of the signal generator from the lowest to
highest frequency you’re checking. Make sure that the output level of the signal generator stays
the same.
</p><p class="paragraph">4. As you sweep through the frequencies, look at the VTVM. You’ll see the amplitude rise and fall
as you vary the output frequency of the signal generator. As you approach the lowest and the
highest frequencies that the magnetic tape recorder can effectively record, you’ll see the VTVM
drop to less than -  3 dB. This determines the lower and upper limits of the frequency-response
specification for that magnetic tape recorder.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">FREQUENCY-RESPONSE LIMITING FACTORS
Four factors that can limit or degrade the frequency response of magnetic tape recorders are:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. A too-high or too-low bias signal level setting for the record head.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. An improper reproduce head.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. An improper tape transport speed.
</p><p class="paragraph">4. A poor magnetic tape-to-head contact.
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnetic record head transforms the electrical signal into a magnetic field for recording onto
magnetic tape. If the bias signal level is set to high, you might erase the higher frequencies. If it’s too low,
you’ll get excessive tape distortion.
</p><p class="paragraph">The reproduce head transforms the magnetic field from the magnetic tape back into an electrical
signal. As explained in chapters 3 and 5, the head gap of a recorder’s reproduce head and the operating
speed of the magnetic tape transport determine the wavelength of the reproduce head. The wavelength
determines the center frequency of a recorder’s frequency-response specification. Once you pass this
center frequency, both below and above, the output voltage level of the recorder’s reproduce head will
decrease. Figure 6-2 shows this. This is why the equalization circuits described in chapter 5, figure 5-3,
are used.
</p><p class="paragraph">Poor tape-to-head contact can seriously degrade the record and reproduce process. Magnetic heads
are designed to reduce tape-to-head gap as much as possible. A tape-to-head gap is extremely degrading at
the higher frequencies. Figure 6-3 shows this. Note how a .1-mil gap causes only a small loss at 10 kHz.
But, at 1 MHz, it causes a 46-dB loss! You must maintain tape-to-head contact. Keeping the magnetic
tape recorder heads and tape transport clean is the best way to do this.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">A magnetic tape recorder’s harmonic-distortion specification is very important. It usually determines
where the record level of a recorder’s electronics should be set. The record level is also used to determine
the signal-to-noise ratio and frequency-response specifications. A typical harmonic-distortion
specification might read "1% third harmonic of a 100-kHz signal at 60 ips." This means that the magnetic
tape recorder has 1% third-harmonic distortion of a 100-kHz signal at 60 ips.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HARMONIC-DISTORTION-DEFINITION-6-6-">HARMONIC-DISTORTION DEFINITION
</h2><p class="paragraph">Harmonic distortion is the production of harmonic frequencies by an electronic system when a signal
is applied at the input. When an input signal goes through nonlinear electronic circuitry, the output signal
will include some harmonic distortion (or unwanted frequencies). If you analyzed this distortion, you’d
see that a pattern exists. A pattern, whereby the frequency of each unwanted frequency is a multiple
( · 1, · 2, · 3, etc.) of the center frequency of the input signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two types of harmonic distortion: even-order and odd-order. If the frequencies of the
distortion are 2, 4, 6, etc., times the center frequency, it’s even-order harmonics. If the frequencies of the
distortion are 3, 5, 7, etc., times the center frequency, it’s odd-order harmonics.
</p><p class="paragraph">Odd-order harmonics are normally caused by the magnetic tape itself. Even-order harmonics are
normally caused by (1) permanently magnetized magnetic heads, (2) faulty circuits, or (3) asymmetrical
or unbalanced bias signals. As you might guess, even-order harmonics can be reduced by doing the right
maintenance and periodic performance tests.
</p><p class="paragraph">The primary harmonic distortion in magnetic tape recorder systems is third-order harmonics. If the
level of third-order harmonics in a recorder increases, the level of distortion will also increase (figures
6-4A and B show this relationship). Two things that determine the level of third-order harmonics in a
recorder are (1) the signal bias level, and (2) the record level. Figure 6-4A shows how third-order
harmonic distortion decreases as the signal bias level increases. Figure 6-4B shows how the third
harmonic increases gradually at first and then abruptly as the record level increases. That’s why the third
harmonic is used to determine the normal record level.

the test signal from the signal generator is recorded and reproduced by the magnetic tape recorder at a
normal record level. The amount of harmonic distortion is measured at the recorder’s output on the wave
analyzer.
</p><p class="paragraph">The technical manual for the magnetic recorder you’re testing will tell you how to set up the test
equipment. It’ll tell you to set up the wave analyzer to measure a specific frequency. This frequency will
be one of the multiples (· 1, · 2, · 3, etc.) of the frequency the signal generator is outputting.
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, let’s say the technical manual told you to set up the signal generator to input a 10-kHz
test signal into the magnetic tape recorder. Since you want to measure third-order harmonics, the
technical manual will tell you to set the wave analyzer to measure the amount of harmonic distortion at
30-kHz.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PHASE-RESPONSE-6-7-">PHASE RESPONSE
</h2><p class="paragraph">It used to be thought that the only important specifications of magnetic tape recorders were
signal-to-noise ratio and frequency response. But now, with the need to record and reproduce more
complex waveforms, such as telemetry and computer data, the phase-response specification becomes as
important as frequency response.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PHASE-RESPONSE-DEFINITION-6-7-">PHASE-RESPONSE DEFINITION
</h2><p class="paragraph">Phase response is the expression of the variation of the phase shift with respect to frequency. A good
magnetic tape recorder will have linearly increasing phase response as frequency increases. In simpler
terms, good phase response shows that a magnetic recorder can reproduce a complex waveform (such as a
square wave which has an infinite number of sine waves) without distorting it. Figure 6-6 shows both
good and bad phase response.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FLUTTER-6-9-">FLUTTER
</h2><p class="paragraph">The general audio and broadcast field coined the term flutter to describe what you’ll actually hear
from the bad effects of this specification.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FLUTTER-DEFINITION-6-9-">FLUTTER DEFINITION
</h2><p class="paragraph">Flutter is the result of non-uniform tape motion caused by variations in tape speed that produces
frequency modulation of signals recorded onto magnetic tape.
</p><p class="paragraph">Flutter is usually expressed as a percent peak or a peak-to-peak value for instrumentation recorders
and as a root-mean-square (RMS) value for audio recorders. It’s caused by magnetic tape transports.
Low-frequency flutter (below 1000 Hz) is caused by the rotating parts of a tape transport such as:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Irregular magnetic tape supply or take-up reels.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Uneven or sticking guide rollers and pinch rollers.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Capstans.
</p><p class="paragraph">High-frequency flutter (above 1000 Hz) is caused by the fixed parts of a tape transport, such as fixed
tape guides and magnetic heads. When the magnetic tape passes over a fixed tape guide or magnetic head,
the transition from static to dynamic friction causes something called stiction. It’s this stiction that causes
the variations in tape speed which, in turn, cause the flutter.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you might guess, it’s hard to prevent flutter. The only way to lessen flutter is through skilled
engineering, machining, and design of magnetic tape recorders.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FLUTTER-MEASUREMENT-6-9-">FLUTTER MEASUREMENT
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are many ways to measure flutter. Most are based on the fact that tape speed variations cause
frequency modulation of a recorded tone. Figure 6-8 shows a typical setup for measuring the peak-to-peak
value of flutter with a frequency-modulation (FM) demodulator and an oscilloscope. The technical
manual for the magnetic tape recorder you’re testing will tell you how to set up the signal generator to
output the test signal. After setting up the test equipment, follow these procedures:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">1. Record the test signal onto magnetic tape; then rewind the magnetic tape. This is necessary
because you can’t measure flutter as you’re recording. Since the tape-speed variation past the
record head is almost the same as past the reproduce head, the flutter level is too small to see.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. After you rewind the tape, play it back. During playback, the output signal from the tape recorder
goes through the FM demodulator to remove the original test signal. The waveform you now see
on the oscilloscope is the actual flutter signal that was modulated onto the test signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Using the oscilloscope display, measure the peak-to-peak value of the flutter signal.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TIME-BASE-ERROR-6-10-">TIME-BASE ERROR
</h2><p class="paragraph">The time-base error (TBE) specification of magnetic tape recorders is closely related to the flutter
specification. In fact, the TBE is a direct measure of the effects of flutter on the stability of recorded data.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TIME-BASE-ERROR-DEFINITION-6-10-">TIME-BASE ERROR DEFINITION
</h2><p class="paragraph">The TBE is the time-relationship error between two or more events recorded and reproduced from
the same magnetic tape. It’s also defined as the displacement of a point on the magnetic tape from where
it should have been, during a specific time interval.
</p><p class="paragraph">A typical TBE specification might read "+ / -  100 microseconds over a 10-millisecond time interval
at a tape speed of 60 inches per second, referenced to a control tone." This means that the time-base error
could cause a signal to jitter +/ -  100 microseconds over a 10-millisecond period at a tape speed of 60
inches per second.
</p><p class="paragraph">TBE jitter introduces noise or unwanted frequency modulation (when using FM recording
techniques) into the magnetic tape recording process. It can also cause a loss of accuracy in pulse-
duration modulation (PDM), pulse-coded modulation (PCM), or other magnetic recordings where precise
timing relationships exist between two or more signals.

the tape transport guides are worn or sticking, the magnetic tape won’t properly pass over the magnetic

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY
</h1><p class="paragraph">Now that you’ve finished chapter 6, you should be able to describe the seven most common magnetic
tape recording specifications and how to measure each specification. The following is a summary of
important points in this chapter:
</p><p class="paragraph">The SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO (SNR) is the ratio of the normal signal level to the tape
recorder’s own noise level measured in dB. The higher a recorder’s SNR, the wider the range of signals it
can record and reproduce.
</p><p class="paragraph">SNR IS STATED IN ONE OF THREE WAYS based on how it was measured. If you don’t know
the way it was measured, you could be misled.
</p><p class="paragraph">A recorder’s FREQUENCY-RESPONSE specification is sometimes called its bandwidth. It tells
the range of frequencies a recorder can effectively record and reproduce. Factors that can degrade a
recorder’s frequency response are an improper bias level setting, reproduce head gap, or tape transport
speed. Also, failure to clean the heads and the tape transport can cause poor tape-to-head contact.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">HARMONIC DISTORTION is the production of unwanted harmonic frequencies when a signal is
applied at the recorder’s input. The primary harmonic distortion in tape recorders is third order harmonics.
It’s measured with a wave analyzer. You can reduce this distortion with proper preventive maintenance
and periodic performance tests.
</p><p class="paragraph">Good PHASE RESPONSE means the recorder can reproduce complex waveforms such as square
waves without distortion. The best way to check a recorder’s phase response is by recording and
reproducing a square wave and checking the output on an oscilloscope.
</p><p class="paragraph">FLUTTER results from non-uniform tape motion caused by variations in tape speed. The tape speed
variations are caused by design and machining deficiencies in the rotating and fixed parts of the tape
transport.
</p><p class="paragraph">TIME-BASE ERROR (TBE) is the time-relationship error between two or more events recorded
on and reproduced from the same magnetic tape. It causes TBE jitter, which introduces noise or loss of
accuracy where precise timing relationships exist between two or more signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">SKEW is the time difference in microseconds between the tracks on a multi-tracked tape recorder.
Fixed or dynamic skew can happen when one of the tracks on the multi-track head leads or lags the track
next to it. Fixed skew errors only show up when you record on one recorder and reproduce on a different
recorder. You can minimize fixed skew by adjusting the recorder’s electronics and aligning the heads.
Dynamic skew errors are caused by worn or sticking tape transport guides or by warped magnetic tape.

digital magnetic tape recording, (2) the eight methods of encoding digital data onto magnetic tape, and
(3) the configuration differences between the three types of digital tape recorders.
</p><p class="paragraph">Until now, you’ve learned about magnetic tape recording from an analog point-of-view. That is, the
signal you record and reproduce is the actual analog input signal waveform. In digital magnetic tape
recording, the signal you record and reproduce is, instead, a series of digital pulses. These pulses are
called binary ones and zeros. These ones and zeros can represent one of three types of data: (1) data used
by digital computers, (2) pulsed square-wave signals, or (3) digitized analog waveforms.
</p><p class="paragraph">The digital magnetic tape recording process stores data onto tape by magnetizing the tape to its
saturation point in one of two possible polarities: positive (+) or negative ( - ). The saturation point of
magnetic tape is the point where the magnetic tape is magnetized as much as it can be.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DIGITAL-MAGNETIC-TAPE-RECORDING-FORMATS-7-1-">DIGITAL MAGNETIC TAPE RECORDING FORMATS
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are three digital magnetic tape recording formats: serial, parallel, and serial-parallel. Each of

single recorder track of the magnetic tape in a single, continuous stream. Figure 7-1A shows how this
looks.

related to each other. Figure 7-1B shows how this looks. This format is usually used to store computer
data.

Bit-cell period: The time occupied by a single digital bit.
</p><p class="paragraph">Packing density: The number of bits per fixed length of magnetic tape per track. There are three

</h2><p class="paragraph">This section describes how digital data is electrically encoded onto the magnetic tape. The following
paragraphs describe the eight most common digital data encoding methods.
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Return to bias (RB)
2. Return to zero (RZ)
3. Non-return to zero (NRZ) and these four variations of the NRZ method:

d. Non-return-to-zero space (NRZ-S)
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Bi-phase level
</p><p class="paragraph">RETURN-TO-BIAS (RB) ENCODING
The RB encoding method uses magnetic tape that is pre-set to one of the two polarities (+ or - ). This
</p><p class="paragraph">pre-sets the magnetic tape to all zeros. Digital ones are then recorded onto the magnetic tape by
magnetizing the tape in the opposite polarity. After each one pulse, the tape returns to its original bias
condition. Figure 7-2 shows the magnetic tape preset to a negative bias condition. It also shows how the
digital data word 0100110001 is stored onto the magnetic tape using the RB encoding method.
</p><p class="paragraph">This method has a serious drawback: It requires an external clocking signal to read the zeros stored

</p><h3 class="subsection">RETURN-TO-ZERO (RZ) ENCODING
The RZ encoding method uses magnetic tape that is normally in a neutral condition (the tape is not
</h3><p class="paragraph">biased positively or negatively). A digital one is recorded as a positive-going pulse: a digital zero is
recorded as a negative-going pulse. The magnetic tape returns to its neutral state in between pulses.
Figure 7-3 shows the magnetic tape in its neutral state. It also shows how the digital data word
0100110001 is stored onto the magnetic tape using return-to-zero encoding.
</p><p class="paragraph">NON-RETURN-TO-ZERO (NRZ) ENCODING
The NRZ encoding method is, by far, the most widely used. It’s accurate, simple, and reliable. It
</p><p class="paragraph">does not return the magnetic tape to its neutral state in between pulses. The magnetic tape is always in
saturation, either positively or negatively. The polarity of the saturating signal only changes when
incoming data changes from a zero to a one and vice versa. Figure 7-4 shows how the digital data word
101100011010 is stored onto the magnetic tape using the NRZ encoding method.

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">7-6
</p><p class="paragraph">There are four widely used variations to the basic NRZ encoding method. Each of these is described
in the following paragraphs.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Non-Return-To-Zero-Level (NRZ-L) Encoding
In NRZ-L encoding, the polarity of the saturating signal changes only when the incoming signal
</h3><p class="paragraph">changes from a one to a zero or from a zero to a one. Figure 7-4 also shows how the digital data word
101100011010 is stored onto the magnetic tape using the NRZ-L encoding method. Note that the NRZ-L
method looks just like the NRZ method, except for the first input one data bit. This is because NRZ does
not consider the first data bit to be a polarity change, where NRZ-L does.
</p><p class="paragraph">The NRZ-L encoding method isn’t normally used in higher density (over 20,000 bpi) digital
magnetic recording. This encoding method is sometimes called the non-return-to-zero-change (NRZ-C)
encoding method.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Enhanced Non-Return-to-Zero-Level (E-NRZ-L) Encoding
This encoding method takes the basic NRZ-L data and adds a parity bit to it after every seven
</h3><p class="paragraph">incoming data bits. The polarity of the parity bit is such that the total number of ones in the eight-bit data
word will be an odd count. Figure 7-5 shows how the digital data word 0100010 is stored onto the
magnetic tape using the E-NRZ-L encoding method.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before the parity bit is added, the original incoming data is compressed in time. This is done so that
when the parity bit is added, the eight-bit data word takes up the same amount of time as the original-
seven bit data word. When the tape is reproduced, the parity bit is taken out.
</p><p class="paragraph">This encoding method works very well in high density (up to 33,000 bpi) magnetic tape recording.
And, it offers an extremely good bit-error rate of 1 error per 1 million bits.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Non-Return-to-Zero-Mark (NRZ-M) Encoding
The NRZ-M encoding method is probably the most widely used encoding method for 800-bpi digital
</h3><p class="paragraph">magnetic tape recording. In this method, the polarity of the saturating signal changes when the incoming
signal is a one. An incoming zero would not change the polarity of the saturating signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">NRZ-M offers better protection from error than straight NRZ. In NRZ-M, there’s a one-to-one
relationship between incoming data and polarity changes. If one data bit is lost, only that one bit is lost.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">7-7
</p><p class="paragraph">Whereas, in straight NRZ, if one bit is lost, all of the bits that follow will be exactly the opposite in
polarity from what they should be. Figure 7-4 also shows how the digital data word 101100011010 is
stored onto the magnetic tape using the NRZ-M encoding method.
</p><p class="paragraph">Non-Return-to-Zero-Space (NRZ-S) Encoding
The NRZ-S encoding method works just like NRZ-M encoding, with one exception. Instead of the
</p><p class="paragraph">saturating signal changing polarity when the incoming data signal is a one, it changes when the incoming
data signal is a zero.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BI-PHASE-LEVEL-ENCODING-7-7-">BI-PHASE LEVEL ENCODING
</h2><p class="paragraph">The bi-phase level encoding method records two logic levels for each incoming data bit. When an
incoming data bit is a one, bi-phase level recording records a zero-one. When an incoming data bit is a
zero, bi-phase level recording records a one-zero. This encoding method helps to overcome any
low-frequency response problems that the magnetic tape recorder may have. Figure 7-6 shows how the
digital data word 101000111001 is stored onto magnetic tape using the bi-phase encoding method.
</p><p class="paragraph">Bi-phase encoding requires exactly twice the bandwidth of NRZ-L. That’s why it’s mostly used in
medium-density digital magnetic tape recording. In fact, this encoding method is probably the most
widely used encoding method for 1600-bpi digital magnetic tape recording.

</h2><p class="paragraph">There are two types of disk recording mediums: flexible diskettes and fixed (hard) disks. The 
following paragraphs describe (1) how flexible and fixed disks are made; (2) how data is organized on 
them; (3) how to handle, store, and ship them; (4) and how to erase them. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FLEXIBLE-MAGNETIC-RECORDING-DISKETTES-8-2-">FLEXIBLE MAGNETIC RECORDING DISKETTES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Flexible diskettes, or floppy disks as they're more commonly called, are inexpensive, flexible, and 
portable magnetic storage mediums. They have the following characteristics. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Floppy Disk Construction 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Floppy disks are made of round plastic disks coated with magnetic oxide particles. The disks are 
enclosed in a plastic jacket which protects the magnetic recording surface from damage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Floppy disks come in three sizes: 8 inch, 5 1/4 inch, and 3 1/2 inch. Figure 8-1 shows each size. All 
disk sizes can either be single-sided or double-sided. Single-sided disks store data on only one side of the 
disk; double-sided disks store data on both sides. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When floppy disks are manufactured, the magnetic oxide coating is applied to both sides. Each disk 
is then checked for errors. Disks certified as single-sided, are checked on only one side; disks certified as 
double-sided are checked on both sides. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Floppy disks are also classified by how much data they can store. This is called a disk's density. 
There are three levels of floppy disk density: single-density, double-density, and high-density. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Some of the more common types of floppy disks and their storage capacity are listed below: </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Floppy Disk Data Organization 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Data is stored on a floppy disk in circular tracks. Figure 8-2 shows a circular track on a floppy disk. 
The total number of tracks on a floppy disk is permanently set by (1) the number of steps the disk drive's 
magnetic head stepper motor can make, and (2) whether the disk drive has a magnetic head for one or 
both surfaces of the floppy disk. These two things will also determine the type of floppy disk that's 
needed. Each type of disk is rated with a number that represents how many tracks per inch (TPI) it can 
hold. Some common track capacities are 40, 48, 80, and 96 TPI. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each track of a floppy disk is broken up into arcs called sectors. A disk is sectored just as you'd slice 
an apple pie. Figure 8-2 shows the sectors of a floppy disk. How many slices are made? That depends on 
who made the disk and in what host computer the disk is used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two methods for sectoring a floppy disk: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Hard Sectoring: This method sectors the disk physically. The disk itself will have marks or sensor 
holes on it that the floppy disk drive hardware can detect. This method is seldom used today. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Soft sectoring: This method sectors the disk logically. The computer software determines the 
sector size and placement, and then slices the disk into sectors by writing codes on the disk. This </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">is called formatting or initializing a floppy disk. During formatting, if the computer software 
locates a bad spot on the disk, it locks it out to prevent the bad spot from being used. Soft 
sectoring is by far the most popular method of sectoring a floppy disk. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Once a floppy disk is formatted, the computer uses the disk's side number, a track number, and a 
sector number (together) as an address. It's this address that locates where on the disk the computer will 
store the data. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Floppy Disk Handling, Storage, and Shipping 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Floppy disks hold a lot of data. Even disks with only a 360,000-byte storage capacity can hold 180 
pages of data! That's why it's important to handle, store, and ship floppy disks properly. One hundred and 
eighty pages of data is a lot of data to retype just because of carelessness. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before we get into disk handling and storage procedures, let's first learn about head-to-disk contact. 
Do you remember reading in chapter 2 that the quality of magnetic tape recording is seriously degraded 
when dust, dirt, or other contaminates get between the magnetic head and the tape? Well, the same is true 
for magnetic disk recording. In fact, head-to-disk contact is extremely important with floppy disks. This is 
because floppy disk drives, unlike magnetic tape drives, spin at very high speeds — 300 to 600 
revolutions-per-minute (RPM). If anything gets between the head and the recording surface, you can lose 
data, or even worse, you can damage the magnetic head and the disk's recording surface. Figure 8-3 
shows the size relationship between a disk drive's magnetic head, the disk recording surface, and some 
common contaminants. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">You must handle, store, and ship floppy disks with great care if you want them to stay in good 
condition. Here's some specific precautions you should take: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always store 8" and 5-1/4" floppy disks in their envelopes when not in use. Dirt, dust, etc., 
can get on the recording surface through the magnetic head read/write access hole if you leave it 
exposed for any length of time. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">8-5 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always write on a floppy disk label first, and then place the label on the disk. NEVER write 
directly on a floppy disk. If you absolutely must write on a disk, use a felt-tip marker. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO hold floppy disks by their outside corners only. DO NOT bend them. And NEVER, NEVER 
paper clip them to anything, or anything to them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always store floppy disks in an upright position. Laying them on their side can cause them to 
warp. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always keep floppy disks away from food, liquids, and cigarette smoke. All of these can 
easily damage floppy disks. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always ship floppy disks in appropriate shipping containers. When shipping only a few disks, 
use the specially designed cardboard shipping envelopes. If you must ship a large number of 
disks, make sure the box you use is sturdy enough to protect the disks from damage. A good rule 
of thumb is to use a shipping box that allows you to place 2 inches of packing material around the 
disks. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT touch any exposed recording surfaces. Something as simple as a fingerprint can destroy 
the data on a floppy disk. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT expose a floppy disk to magnetic fields. Telephones, magnetic copy holders, printers, 
and other electronic equipment generate magnetic fields that can destroy the data on a floppy 
disk. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT expose floppy disks to extreme heat or cold. Floppy disks will last longer if they're 
stored in an environment that stays around 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit and 30-60 percent relative 
humidity. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Floppy Disk Erasing 
</h3><p class="paragraph">There are two ways to erase a floppy disk: (1) degauss it and then reformat it, or (2) just reformat it. 
The process for degaussing floppy disks is the same as for degaussing magnetic tape. Refer back to 
chapter 2 for the details on this. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the floppy disks were used to store classified, or unclassified but sensitive information, they can't 
be de-classified by erasing them. This is because, with the right equipment and software, the data that was 
on the disk can be reconstructed. Floppy disks are cheap and easy to replace. If you can't re-use the floppy 
disks to store other classified data, just destroy them, using the procedures in OPNAVINST 5510.1, DON 
Information and Personnel Security Program Regulation.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fixed disks, or hard disks as they're more commonly called, are expensive, rigid, semi-portable, 
magnetic storage mediums. They have the following characteristics: 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Hard Disk Construction 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Most hard disks are made of aluminum platters coated on both sides with either iron oxide or 
thin-film metal magnetic coatings. The first type, iron oxide, is the most common (you can recognize this 
coating by its rust color). This is the same oxide coating that's used on magnetic tape. The second type of 
coating, thin-film metal, is the newer and better of the two. This coating is a microscopic layer of metal 
that's bonded to the aluminum platter. You can recognize it by its shiny silver color. Thin-film 
metal-coated hard disks are becoming more and more popular because they allow more data to be stored 
in less space. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Hard disks can hold a lot of data, the smallest disk being 10,000,000 bytes, and the largest being 
about 2,500,000,000 bytes (and they're working on larger ones). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Hard disk platters come in many sizes, ranging from 14" to 2". The most common sizes are 3-1/2", 
5-1/4" and 14". The first two sizes are usually used with smaller personal computers. The 14" size is 
usually used with the larger mini and mainframe computers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most hard disk drives use more than one hard disk platter to store data. These are called disk packs. 
Some hard disk drives use removable hard disk platters. These can use just one platter, or they can use 
disk packs containing many platters. Most of the multi-platter removable hard disk drives in use today use 
14" hard disk platters. Figure 8-4 shows a hard disk-pack. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">Data is stored on a hard disk the same way it's stored on a floppy disk, in circular tracks. The total 
number of tracks on a hard disk is set, just like floppy disk, by (1) the number of steps the disk drive's 
magnetic head stepper motor can make, and (2) whether the disk drive has a magnetic head for one or 
both surfaces of the hard disk platter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A computer places data on a hard disk using one of two methods, either (1) the cylinder method, or 
(2) the sector method. The manufacturer of the hard disk drive decides which method to use. 
</p><p class="paragraph">THE CYLINDER METHOD.—This method uses a cylinder as the basic reference for placing data 
on a hard disk. Look at figure 8-5 view A. This is a picture of a disk pack containing six hard disk 
platters. Notice that this particular disk drive uses only 10 out of the 12 available recording surfaces. If 
you imagine that you're looking down through the disk pack from above, the tracks with the same number 
on each of the 10 recording surfaces will line up. Put together, these tracks make up a cylinder. Each of 
these 10 tracks with the same number, one on each recording surface, can be read from and written to by 
one of the disk drive's 10 read/write magnetic heads that are positioned by the five access arms. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">8-8 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">So, to locate a place to store data using the cylinder method, a computer must specify the cylinder 
number, the recording surface number, and the record number. Figure 8-5 view A shows record number 
1 stored on cylinder 25 of recording surface number 6. Special data is stored on each track to tell the 
computer where the start of a track is. 
</p><p class="paragraph">THE SECTOR METHOD.—Although we talked about this method earlier under the heading 
"Floppy Disk Data Organization," we need to repeat it here as it also applies to hard disks. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The sector method of organizing data on a hard disk is actually a variation of the cylinder method. 
As you already know, the sector method slices up a hard disk into pie-shaped slices (just like floppy 
disks). The total number of slices is set by the hard disk drive manufacturer. Figure 8-5 view B shows an 
example of the sector method. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Unlike a floppy disk drive, which locates a place on the disk using the surface number, track 
number, and sector number, a hard disk drive locates a place on the disk by using the surface number, 
cylinder number, and sector number. This is true even if the hard disk has only one platter. That's because 
both surfaces of that one platter still form a cylinder. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Hard Disk Handling, Storage, and Shipping 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Hard disks hold a lot more data than floppy disks; even the lowest capacity hard disk can hold 5,000 
pages of data! That's why it's important to handle, store, and ship hard disks properly. If you think 180 
pages of data is a lot to retype, just think of retyping 5,000 pages! </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Hard disk drives spin at a very high speed of about 3600 RPM. It is extremely important that nothing 
gets between the head and the recording surface. If it does, you can lose data and you can damage both 
the magnetic head and the disk's recording surface. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most hard disk failures involve a head-crash. It's the worst thing that can happen to a hard disk. A 
head-crash is the result of the disk drive's magnetic heads crashing into the recording surface and 
grinding into the hard disk platter. Figure 8-6 shows a good hard disk platter and a bad hard disk platter 
that was the victim of a head-crash. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">You must handle, store, and ship hard disks with extreme care if you want them to stay in good 
condition. Here are some specific precautions you should take: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always store removable hard disks in their storage cases when not in use. Dirt, dust, etc., can 
get on the recording surface through the magnetic head read/write access hole if you leave it 
exposed for any length of time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always handle hard disks with extreme care. DO NOT drop them. Even a small drop of 2" 
can warp a hard disk platter enough to cause a head crash.

can easily cause damage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO always ship hard disks in their proper shipping containers. If you don't have the original

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RECORDING-DIGITAL-DATA-ON-MAGNETIC-DISKS-8-10-">RECORDING DIGITAL DATA ON MAGNETIC DISKS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Digital data is stored on a magnetic disk using magnetic pulses. These pulses are generated by 
passing a frequency modulated (FM) current through the disk drive's magnetic head. This FM current 
generates a magnetic field that magnetizes the particles of the disk's recording surface directly under the 
magnetic head. The pulse can be one of two polarities, positive or negative. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Digital data isn't just recorded onto a magnetic disk as-is. Instead, it's encoded onto the disk. Three of 
the most popular encoding methods are (1) frequency modulation (FM), (2) modified frequency 
modulation (MFM), and (3) run length limited (RLL). The following paragraphs describe each of these 
encoding methods. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">FREQUENCY MODULATION (FM) ENCODING 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The FM method of encoding digital data onto a disk uses two pulse periods to represent each bit of 
data (a pulse period is the time span of one pulse). The first pulse period always contains a clock pulse. 
The second pulse-period may, or may not, contain a data pulse. If the digital data is a "1," a data pulse 
will be present in the second pulse-period. But, if the digital data is a "0," then there's no pulse present. 
Figure 8-7 shows this. The clock pulse, which is always present, tells the disk drive's interface that the 
next pulse is a data pulse. It is used to compensate for changes in the disk's rotation speed. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">MODIFIED FREQUENCY-MODULATION (MFM) ENCODING 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The MFM method of encoding digital data onto a disk is more popular because it is more efficient 
and more reliable than straight FM encoding. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MFM encoding still uses two pulse periods, but uses a lot fewer pulses to store the digital data onto 
the disk. It does this in two ways: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. It does away with the clock pulse that the FM method uses. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. It stores a digital "1" by generating a no-pulse and a pulse in the two pulse periods. It stores a 
digital "0" as either a pulse and a no-pulse if the last bit was a "0," or as two no-pulses if the last 
bit was a "1." Figure 8-8 shows this.

method. As its name implies, RLL limits the run length (distance) between pulses (also called flux 
reversals) on a hard disk. The basic theory of RLL encoding is that you can store more data in less space 
if you reduce the number of flux reversals (or pulses) that you must record. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are several versions of the RLL encoding method, the most popular version being the 2,7 RLL. 
This means that no fewer than 2 no-pulses and no more than 7 no-pulses can occur between pulses.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Like magnetic tape recorders, if you want a magnetic disk drive to continue storing and retrieving 
data without errors, you must periodically perform preventive maintenance. Fortunately, disk drives 
require less maintenance than magnetic tape drives. The following paragraphs describe the preventive 
maintenance requirements for both floppy and hard disk drives. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FLOPPY-DISK-DRIVE-PREVENTIVE-MAINTENANCE-8-16-">FLOPPY DISK DRIVE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Of all of the magnetic disk drives in use today, floppy disk drives require the most maintenance. This 
is because they are not sealed units like most hard drives and because they use flimsy plastic disks that are 
coated with the same type of oxide as magnetic tape. 
</p><p class="paragraph">It's this oxide that causes most of the problems you'll have with floppy disk drives. Just as with 
magnetic tape, the oxide coating wears off of the plastic backing and sticks (mainly) to the magnetic 
heads. This contamination causes dropout errors which have much graver consequences than with 
magnetic tape. It can cause a program to crash, or even worse — it can destroy your valuable data. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To prevent this, you must periodically clean the floppy disk drive's magnetic heads. There are many 
kits available to do the job. A kit has a cleaning disk and a bottle of cleaning solution. A cleaning disk 
looks just like a regular disk, except that instead of an oxide-coated disk, it has a cloth or fiber cleaning 
disk inside the protective jacket. The instructions that come with the cleaning kit will lead you through the 
cleaning process. Here is an example of the cleaning procedures for a floppy disk drive's magnetic heads: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Pour some of the cleaning solution onto the cleaning disk through the access hole in the 
protective jacket. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Insert the cleaning disk into the disk drive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Exercise the disk drive for at least 30 seconds. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Remove the disk from the disk drive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are also some cleaning kits that use disposable cleaning disks. These kits will instruct you to 
clean the heads as follows: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Open the scaled envelope that contains a cleaning disk soaked in cleaning solution. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Insert the cleaning disk into the protective jacket provided. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Insert the cleaning disk (with protective jacket) into the disk drive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Exercise the disk drive for 30 seconds. 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. Remove the disk from the disk drive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">6. Remove the cleaning disk from the protective jacket and throw it away. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now comes the question "How often must I clean the heads?" That's hard to say. It depends on the 
type of disk drive, the quality of the floppy disks you use, and how much you use the disk drive. On the 
average, you should clean a floppy disk drive

need preventive maintenance because it's a sealed unit that you must not open for any reason. If it's a 
cartridge disk drive, the manufacturer will have a special cleaning disk with instructions for doing the 
preventive maintenance. The Navy uses some larger cartridge disk drives, such as the 14" disk pack 
drives, that require some other preventive maintenance. This could include the following:

the data off of the disk, formats it as needed, and sends it to the interface electronics for output to the host 
computer. The write/read electronics also performs the initial disk formatting function. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTERFACE-ELECTRONICS-8-18-">INTERFACE ELECTRONICS

</p><p class="paragraph">2. Convert the incoming and outgoing data as needed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A disk drive is a serial device. This means the data stored on the disk is stored in a serial pulse-train 
format. But the data coming from the disk drive and going to the host computer needs to be in a parallel 
data format. The interface electronics converts the data from parallel to serial, and vice versa, as needed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are many types of disk drive interfaces in use today. The five most common ones are the: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) interface.

</p><p class="paragraph">5. Integrated drive electronics (IDE). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The following paragraphs describe each of these interfaces. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) Interface 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The NTDS interface is used by many naval electronic warfare systems. There are three versions of 
this interface: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. NTDS FAST: A parallel interface that can transfer data at a rate of 250,000 32-bit words per

</p><h3 class="subsection">ST-506/412 Interface 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ST-506/412 interface was developed by Seagate Technology, Inc. It's often used in the hard disk 
drives installed in older IBM-compatible desktop computers that have a maximum capacity of 125 MB. 
It's also the interface used to control most floppy disk drives in use today. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">This is one of the interfaces where most of the electronics is actually on a controller card mounted in 
the host computer. With this interface, the controller card does most of the work (moving the magnetic 
head, spinning the disk, etc.). The controller card also cleans any data coming from the disk drive by 
stripping off the formatting and control signals that were used to store the data onto the hard disk. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A hard disk drive is connected to the controller card in the host computer via two ribbon cables (a 
34-pin control cable and a 20-pin data cable). Floppy drives use only the 34-pin control cable to transfer 
both data and control signals. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When this interface was originally developed in 1981, it's 5-Mbits per second transfer rate was 
considered too fast. They actually slowed it down by using a 6:1 interleave factor (we'll define this later) 
so it could operate with the computers being built at that time. With today's transfer rates pushing the 
envelope at 24 Mbits per second, you can see that it's now one of the slowest interfaces. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Enhanced Small Device Interface (ESDI) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ESDI is an optimized version of the ST-506/412 interface. The main difference is that with 
ESDI, most of the disk drive's interface electronics is located in the disk drive itself, rather than on a 
controller card in the host computer. The result is a much faster transfer rate and more hard disk capacity. 
ESDIs have a transfer rate of up to 24 MB per second. And, they can handle disk drives with a maximum 
capacity of 1.2 GB (gigabytes). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ESDI uses the same interface cables as the ST-506/412 interface, but that's where the similarity 
ends. With ESDI drives, only the clean data is sent to the controller card in the host computer. All 
formatting and control signals are stripped off at the hard disk drive. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Small Computer Systems Interface (SCSI) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The SCSI (pronounced skuzzy) is very different from both the ST-506/412 and the ESDI. The SCSI 
is an 8-bit, parallel, high-level interface. High-level means that instead of a host computer asking for data 
by specifying a track, cylinder, and sector number, all it asks for is a logical sector number. The SCSI 
then translates the logical sector number into the actual disk location. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The SCSI also has other improvements over the previous disk drive interfaces. For example, it can: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Transfer data at rates of up to 4 MB per second. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Handle hard disk drives of almost any size. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Disconnect itself from a host computer's bus while it processes requests. This frees-up the host 
computer to do other things. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Daisy-chain up to eight units off of one controller. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The SCSI interface uses one 50-pin ribbon cable to connect the hard disk drive(s) to the controller 
card mounted in the host computer. Some computer manufacturers include the SCSI electronics in their 
motherboards and do away with a separate controller card altogether. This interface got its big break 
when Apple Computer Corporation used the SCSI as its hard disk drive interface in its MacIntosh 
computers. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">The IDE is the newest interface available. It was developed as a result of trying, to find a cheaper 
way to build computer systems. It includes all of the controller card electronics in the hard disk drive 
itself, thus, the hard drive does all the work. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The hard disk drive connects to the host computer's bus with a 40-pin ribbon cable. The ribbon cable 
connects directly to either a 40-pin connector on the host computer's motherboard or a 40 pin connector 
on a small interface card that plugs into the host computer's motherboard. This interface offers a transfer 
rate of up to 1 MB and can handle hard drives with a maximum capacity of 300 MB.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MAGNETIC-DISK-RECORDING-SPECIFICATIONS-8-20-">MAGNETIC DISK RECORDING SPECIFICATIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Think back to the chapter 6 on "Magnetic Tape Recording Specifications." Do you remember how to 
measure and adjust them if needed? Well, magnetic disk recording specifications are a little different. 
They're set by the manufacturer and you can't change them. All you can do is measure them. The 
following paragraphs describe six of the most common specifications. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SEEK-TIME-8-20-">SEEK TIME 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The seek time is the amount of time it takes for the magnetic head to position itself over a specific 
track of a magnetic disk. It's usually stated in milliseconds. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LATENCY-PERIOD-8-20-">LATENCY PERIOD 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The latency period is the amount of time it takes for a specific sector of a specific track to position 
itself under the magnetic head. It too, is usually stated in ms. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ACCESS-TIME-8-20-">ACCESS TIME 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The access time is the sum of the seek time and the latency period. It's the total amount of time in ms 
that it takes a disk drive to retrieve a sector of data from the magnetic disk. Access time is stated in one of 
the following three ways: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Track-to-track seek time: This is the amount of time it takes a disk drive to access data from a 
track next to the track it's presently over. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Average seek time: This is the amount of time it takes a disk drive to access data that's located 
one-third of the way across the magnetic disk. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Maximum seek time: This is the amount of time it takes a disk drive to access data from the last 
track of a magnetic disk when it's presently on the first track of the magnetic disk. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTERLEAVE-FACTOR-8-20-">INTERLEAVE FACTOR 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The interleave factor applies only to hard disk drives. They spin at 3600 RPM, a very fast speed 
compared to floppy disk drives which only spin at 300-600 RPM. Interleave indicates how many physical 
sectors are between sequentially numbered logical sectors on a hard disk. It's used when the magnetic 
heads and the control circuitry can't process the data fast enough to sequentially number the sectors on a 
hard disk platter. With interleave, the magnetic head is told to skip X number of sectors to get to the next 
one. For example, a hard disk with 17 sectors per track and no interleave is numbered 1, 2, 3, 4.... 17. The 
same hard disk with an interleave factor of 3 is numbered 1, 7, 13, 2, 8, 14, 3, 9, 15, 4, 10, 16, 5, 11, 17, 6, </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

drives have no interleave. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TRANSFER-RATE-8-21-">TRANSFER RATE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The transfer rate states how fast a disk drive and a disk drive controller (working together) can 
transfer data to the host computer. An example of a transfer rate specification is "2 Mbits/sec," or two 
million bits per second. The higher the number, the faster the data transfer rate. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RECORDING-DENSITY-8-21-">RECORDING DENSITY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The recording density states how close together bits can be stored on the recording surface of a 
magnetic disk. It determines two things: (1) How close together the tracks on the disk will be, and 
(2) how close together the bits on each track will be. An example of a recording density specification is 
"12 Mbits/in2," or 12 million bits per square inch.

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY 
</h1><p class="paragraph">Now that you've finished chapter 8, you should be able to describe the (1) characteristics of floppy 
and hard disks, (2) methods for encoding digital data onto magnetic disks, (3) disk drive transports and 
their preventive maintenance requirements, (4) parts of a disk drive's electronics component, and 
(5) common types of disk drive interface electronics. The following is a summary of important points in 
this chapter: 
</p><p class="paragraph">FLOPPY DISKS are single-sided or double-sided plastic disks coated with oxide particles. The 
disks can be single-density, double-density, or high density. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Data is stored on floppy disks in CIRCULAR TRACKS. The tracks are divided into arcs called 
SECTORS. 
</p><p class="paragraph">HANDLE, SHIP, and STORE floppy disks carefully. Contaminates between the heads and the disk 
surface can cause serious damage. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">FIXED (HARD) DISKS are aluminum platters coated on both sides with iron oxide or thin-film 
metal. Most hard disk drives use disk packs which are several disk platters stacked together. Some hard 
disk drives use removable disk platters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Either the CYLINDER OR SECTOR METHOD is used to place data on hard disks. 
</p><p class="paragraph">HANDLE, STORE, AND SHIP HARD DISKS with extreme care. Contaminates on the heads or 
the disk surface can cause head-crash. 
</p><p class="paragraph">ERASE HARD AND FLOPPY DISKS by reformatting or degaussing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Three popular METHODS FOR ENCODING DIGITAL DATA ONTO DISKS are frequency 
modulation, modified frequency modulation, and run length limited. 
</p><p class="paragraph">FLOPPY DISK DRIVE TRANSPORTS contain the parts that (1) spin the floppy disk, (2) write 
data to the disk, and (3) read data from it. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The DRIVE MOTOR/SPINDLE ASSEMBLY of a floppy disk drive transport holds and spins the 
floppy disk. The transport's HEAD ARM ASSEMBLY holds the read/write heads and its ACTUATOR 
ARM ASSEMBLY positions the heads over the disk's recording surface. 
</p><p class="paragraph">HARD DISK DRIVE TRANSPORTS contain the parts that (1) rotate the hard disk platter, 
(2) write data to the disk, and (3) read data from the disk. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The DRIVE MOTOR/SPINDLE ASSEMBLY of a hard disk drive transport holds the disk pack in 
place while the drive motor spins the spindle at 3600 RPM. The transport's HEAD ARM ASSEMBLY 
holds the read/write heads and its ACTUATOR ARM ASSEMBLY positions the heads over the correct 
track of the hard disk. 
</p><p class="paragraph">FLOPPY DISK DRIVES REQUIRE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE at regular intervals 
because they are not sealed units and the disks use an oxide coating that wears off and sticks to the heads 
and other parts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">HARD DISK DRIVES REQUIRE VERY LITTLE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE. 
Cartridge disk drives will have a special cleaning kit for doing the preventive maintenance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Magnetic DISK DRIVE ELECTRONICS consist of (1) control electronics to control the 
electromechanical parts of a disk drive, (2) write/read electronics to write data to and read data from a 
disk drive, and (3) interface electronics to interface the disk drive to the host computer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC DISK RECORDING SPECIFICATIONS are set by the manufacturer; all you can 
do is measure them. Six of the most common specifications are seek time, latency period, access time, 
interleave factor, transfer rate, and recording density.
