of resistance, capacitance, and inductance.
</p><p class="paragraph">Much of the theory of operation and practical applications of the basic types of test instruments used
in electrical and electronic circuits are found in the instruction books and technical manuals that
accompany various equipments. You should read and understand these books before you attempt to use
any test instrument. You should also know the established safety precautions to ensure your safety and
safe equipment operating procedures to protect equipment from damage.
</p><h3 class="subsection">TEST EQUIPMENT IDENTIFICATION
One of the first things you must learn as a maintenance technician is how to identify the various
</h3><p class="paragraph">electronic equipment and components by their appropriate nomenclatures. You will find that several
methods are used to identify test equipment used; this may be somewhat confusing to you at first. For
example, a Tektronix Model 541A oscilloscope can also be identified as a CBTV-541A. The Joint
Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS) is used by all branches of the military to identify
equipment by a system of standardized nomenclatures.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-1. What system is currently used by all branches of the military to identify test equipment?
</p><h3 class="subsection">ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT CLASSIFICATION
The Electronic Test Equipment Classification Board was established in 1973 to control the increased
</h3><p class="paragraph">use of undesirable electronic test equipment (ETE) in fleet and shore activities. The board classifies
electronic test equipments as GENERAL PURPOSE (GPETE) or SPECIAL PURPOSE (SPETE) and
assigns responsibility for their management. Items classified as general purpose are managed by the
Space and Warfare Systems Command (SPAWARSYSCOM). Items classified as special purpose are
managed by the individual systems command that generates the requirement.
</p><p class="paragraph">GPETE is test equipment that has the capability, without modification, to generate, modify, or
measure a range of parameters of electronic functions required to test two or more equipments or systems
of basically different design.
</p><p class="paragraph">Special-purpose electronic test equipment (SPETE) is specifically designed to generate, modify, or
measure a range of parameters of electronic functions of a specific or peculiar nature required to test a
single system or equipment. These special test equipments are procured by the systems command that has
the responsibility for the system/equipment requiring the SPETE for maintenance.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-2. Name the two classes of test equipment.
 Q-3. What test equipment is designed to generate, modify, or measure a range of parameters of
</p><p class="paragraph">electronic functions of a specific nature required to test a single system or equipment?
Until the ETE classification board was established, the uncontrolled increase in use of nonstandard
</p><p class="paragraph">GPETE had resulted in loss of inventory control and increased support costs. NESEA has the
responsibility for evaluating requests to purchase nonstandard GPETE and for recommending its approval
or disapproval to NAVSEA. NAVSEA will then forward its final decision to the originating command for
such requests.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">SHIP CONFIGURATION AND LOGISTIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (SCLSIS) PROGRAM
The Navy must maintain, update, and calibrate thousands of pieces of equipment. To do this, the
</p><p class="paragraph">SHIP CONFIGURATION AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT INFORMATION SYSTEM (SCLSIS) program
was designed to keep track of all installed and portable equipment in the fleet. SCLSIS is used to keep up
with the existence, location, and changes made to equipment. The SCLSIS program seeks to improve the
quality of equipment reporting, provide information needed by other Navy management systems, and
reduce record keeping. It is also designed to assist Navy supply systems that furnish spares,
documentation, and training necessary to support installed and portable equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, the inventory of assigned test equipment on board ship is directly related to SCLSIS
records. Properly maintained SCLSIS records also show the complete inventory of test equipment on
board by quantity, serial number, and location. The SCLSIS program has two basic elements: (1)
VALIDATION, to establish a baseline data inventory, and (2) INVENTORY UPDATING, to correct
errors or omissions and to document configuration changes.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-4. Name the two basic elements of the SCLSIS program.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CALIBRATION-AND-REPAIR-PROCEDURES-1-3-">CALIBRATION AND REPAIR PROCEDURES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The difference between the terms calibration and repair needs to be addressed before we proceed
further. Calibration is little more than checking, adjusting, or systematically aligning a test instrument to a
known standard. To do this, you must ensure that the equipment you send to the calibration lab is in
working order.
</p><p class="paragraph">The calibration lab is where actual repair work becomes important. Obvious problems, such as open
power cords, burned components, broken meters, and missing hardware, should be repaired or replaced
before sending equipment to the calibration lab. Most calibration labs with which you will deal will be
part of an intermediate maintenance activity (IMA) on board a tender.
CALIBRATION STATUS
</p><p class="paragraph">You can determine the calibration status of any test equipment by checking the calibration label or
tag located on the equipment. These calibration labels or tags advise you as to whether the item is usable
and within its calibration interval. Tags and labels to be used in the METROLOGY CALIBRATION
(METCAL) coordination program are listed in the following paragraphs. No other calibration labels or
tags are authorized to be placed on test equipment.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Calibrated Label
</h3><p class="paragraph">The CALIBRATED label, shown in view A of figure 1-1, has black lettering and a white
background and comes in two sizes. It is the most commonly used label in the METCAL program. This
label indicates that the instrument to which it is attached is within its applicable tolerance on all
parameters. If there are any qualifying conditions for use of the instrument, one of the other labels
described in the next paragraphs should be used.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-5. What calibration label is used when actual measurement values must be known to use the test
equipment?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Special Calibration Labels
</h3><p class="paragraph">Two SPECIAL CALIBRATION labels are shown in view C of figure 1-1 that have black lettering
and a yellow background; the size and content of the labels are different. A SPECIAL CALIBRATION
tag (figure 1-1, view C) is used with the smaller of the two labels. These labels or tag are used when some
unusual or special condition in the calibration should be drawn to your attention.
</p><p class="paragraph">Such special conditions may be deviations from usual calibration tolerances, multiple calibration
intervals, or a requirement for in-place calibration. The special condition that resulted in the SPECIAL
CALIBRATION label should be described on the large label when sufficient space is available on the
instrument or on the tag when the small label is used. Brief descriptions of special conditions are provided
in the following paragraphs.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-6. An instrument that must be calibrated in place requires what type of calibration label?
In cases where you do not require full instrument capability, the calibration can be performed with
</p><p class="paragraph">reduced tolerances or cover less than all ranges and parameters. This approach is often used when the
instrument does not meet full calibration tolerances on certain ranges or parameters, but can still meet
user requirements. On the other hand, the special calibration may be for higher accuracy than usual on a
short-term basis upon your specific request.
</p><p class="paragraph">MULTIPLE CALIBRATION INTERVALS.—Some instruments have components that require
calibration less frequently than the rest of the instrument. For example, the attenuator in a signal generator
may require calibration every 12 months, whereas the rest of the instrument parameters should be
calibrated every 4 months. Since the attenuator calibration is time consuming and may require unavailable
standards, use of the multiple-interval approach can save considerable time (man-hours) as well as permit
the more frequent calibration to be performed at a lower level laboratory.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a specific instrument has been designed for multiple calibration intervals, such information is
provided in the applicable calibration procedure. The SPECIAL CALIBRATION label or tag is annotated
with the words MULTIPLE INTERVAL, and the type of calibration performed is indicated; for example,
partial 1 of 2, 2 of 2, complete calibration, and so forth. The calibration due date reflects the due date of
the next partial or complete calibration.
</p><p class="paragraph">CALIBRATION IN-PLACE.—Some instruments should be calibrated in-place. Annotation on the
SPECIAL CALIBRATION label or tag will alert both you and the calibrator that the instrument should
not be removed, but should be calibrated in-place.
</p><h3 class="subsection">User Calibration Label
</h3><p class="paragraph">Some test and measuring equipment (T&amp;ME) should be calibrated by you instead of your referring
the instrument to a calibration facility. For example, some instruments, such as hardness testers and
densitometers, are provided with their own standards and should be calibrated each time used, or at least
very frequently. Some instruments, such as oscillographic recorders, may require calibration before,
during, and after each use.
</p><p class="paragraph">Other automatic test equipment (ATE) have self-calibration tests that should be performed each time
used or each day of use. Still other instruments are calibrated as part of checkout procedures performed
daily or weekly and recorded in maintenance logs. Whenever recognized, the requirement for calibration</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">by the user and the calibration interval (each use—daily, weekly, every 100 hours—each overhaul, and so
forth) is indicated in the Metrology Requirements List (METRL).
</p><p class="paragraph">The USER CALIBRATION label, shown in view D of figure 1-1, has black lettering and a white
background and is affixed when the calibration is performed by the user; however, this label is not
replaced at each calibration. When the label is first attached to the instrument, it is annotated as to the
appropriate calibration interval. Records of calibrations performed, when other than each time used,
should be by normal maintenance practices; that is, in the maintenance log, on maintenance action forms,
and so forth.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Inactive—Calibrate Before Use Label
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the event that an individual instrument due for recalibration will not be used for some time in the
future, you may indefinitely postpone the recalibration by affixing an inactive label to the instrument. As
shown in view E of figure 1-1, the INACTIVE—CALIBRATE BEFORE USE label has green lettering
and a white background. The INACTIVE label remains on the instrument until it is recalibrated. The
instrument is not to be used while bearing this label.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Calibration Not Required Label
</h3><p class="paragraph">Test equipment standards and T&amp;ME not requiring calibration are shown as CALIBRATION NOT
REQUIRED. This label, shown in view F of figure 1-1, has orange letters and a white background. It is
attached to and should remain on the instrument indefinitely unless its calibration requirements change. If
the instrument is not listed in METRL, you should use the following criteria when placing instruments in
the CALIBRATION NOT REQUIRED category:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Instrument does not make quantitative measurements nor provide quantified outputs.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The device is "fail-safe"; that is, operation beyond specified tolerances will be apparent to the
user.
</p><p class="paragraph">• All measurement/stimulus circuits are monitored during use by calibrated instruments or are
dependent on external known or calibrated sources for performance within required limits. (When
determining that an instrument falls into the CALIBRATION NOT REQUIRED category, you
should annotate the label as to the authority for the decision, such as METRL, technical manual,
letter or message from higher authority.)
</p><h3 class="subsection">Rejected—refer To Attached Tag Label
In the event that an instrument fails to meet the acceptance criteria during calibration and cannot be
</h3><p class="paragraph">adequately repaired, a REJECTED—REFER TO ATTACHED TAG label is placed on the instrument and
all other servicing labels removed. This label, as shown in view G of figure 1-1, has black letters and a
red background. In addition to the REJECTED label, a REJECTED tag, giving the reason for rejection
and other information as required, is attached to the instrument. Both the label and tag remain on the
instrument until it is repaired and recalibrated. The instrument is not to be used while bearing a
REJECTED label.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Calibration Void If Seal Broken Label
</h3><p class="paragraph">The CALIBRATION VOID IF SEAL BROKEN label, shown in view H of figure 1-1, has black
letters and a white background. It is placed over readily accessible (usually exterior) adjustments to
prevent tampering by the user when such tampering could affect the calibration. The label should not be</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">used to cover adjustments or controls that are part of the normal use and operation of the instrument. This
label may also be used to prevent removal and/or interchange of plug-ins, modules, subassemblies, and so
forth, when such removal or interchange would affect the calibration.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-REPAIR-PROCEDURES-1-7-">REPAIR PROCEDURES
</h2><p class="paragraph">If you are unable to replace a known failed component with onboard spares, you can often locate the
replacement component from other supply sources. The replacement component can then be delivered,
along with the inoperative equipment, to the IMA. So by sending the repair part along with the
equipment, you can reduce repair time considerably. This is particularly true when your unit is getting
under way and no time is available for you to complete the repair before calibration. Most operational
commands have a higher supply priority for purchase of repair parts than the IMA can use.
</p><h3 class="subsection">"No Reject" Policy
IMAs have a "no reject" policy on test equipment to provide operational test equipment in a more
</h3><p class="paragraph">timely manner. The "no reject" policy says, in effect, that test equipment submitted to the IMA for
calibration, which is later found to require repair, will be repaired by the repair department of the IMA.
Before this policy, any equipment found inoperative by the calibration lab was marked REJECTED, the
reasons stated, and the equipment returned uncalibrated to the ship for repairs. The "no reject" policy does
not relieve you of your responsibility to ensure your equipment is in working order prior to submitting it
for calibration. Its purpose is to streamline the procedure and cut down delays in returning your
equipment to you calibrated and ready to use.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Responsibility for Repair and Maintenance of Test Equipment
</h3><p class="paragraph">Generally, the responsibility for repair and maintenance of test equipment is placed on maintenance
personnel. In some cases, however, maintenance personnel are not authorized to make repairs. Then the
test instrument must be sent to a shore repair/calibration facility.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-7. Responsibility for repair and maintenance of test equipment generally rests with what group of
personnel?
</p><p class="paragraph">When test equipment is sent for calibration and repair, all accessories, such as probes, adapters, and
calibration sheets, should be included. Only in emergencies or special situations should partial repair or
calibration be attempted on test equipment designated as nonrepairable. Such emergency repairs should
be noted on a tag attached to the unit and an entry made on the MEASURE card (discussed shortly). The
equipment should then be sent at the earliest opportunity to an authorized facility so that permanent
repairs can be made and the unit calibrated.
</p><p class="paragraph">STOWAGE AND HANDLING OF TEST EQUIPMENT
Most electronic test equipment is precision equipment. Such equipment must be handled with care to
</p><p class="paragraph">properly perform its designed functions. Rough handling, excessive heat, moisture, and dust all affect the
useful life of the equipment. Bumping or dropping a test instrument may ruin the calibration of a meter,
cause short circuits, or damage electronic elements inside the case. Sharp bends, creases, or dents in
coaxial test cables can alter the expected attenuating effect and cause false meter readings or
measurements. Forced air cooling, dust filters, and heaters are used in many pieces of equipment. This
test equipment requires clean air filters for proper ventilation and a warm-up period that permits units in
the equipment to maintain calibrated standards.
</p><p class="paragraph">Electronic test equipment should be stowed in a dry location with the dust cover (if provided) in
place. Dust covers for spare plug-in units should be constructed for such stowage. For ease in performing</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">maintenance, the test equipment should be stowed at a location convenient to equipment spaces. If
possible, related test equipment should be mounted in the equipment spaces. This reduces the problem of
finding adequate stowage space elsewhere.
</p><p class="paragraph">In stowage spaces, individual pieces of test equipment should be held in place by stretch seat-belt-
type straps. If bars are used to hold equipment on shelves, meters and control knobs should be protected
by blocking the equipment to prevent it from rolling and sliding on the shelf. Test equipment too large for
shelf stowage should be kept in stowage cases and tie-downs provided to secure the cases. Refer to
Stowage Guide for Portable Test Equipment, NAVSEA ST000-AB-GYD-010/GPETE, to determine
adequate stowage space and proper weight support requirements.

</h3><p class="paragraph">For the sake of simplicity, we will use the more commonly used acronym MEASURE instead of the
full name to describe this system in the next discussion.
</p><p class="paragraph">MEASURE is a data processing system designed to provide a standardized system for the recall and
scheduling of test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE) into calibration facilities. It also
provides for the documentation of data pertaining to the calibration actions performed by these facilities.
</p><p class="paragraph">The primary reference document that describes the operation of the MEASURE system is Metrology
Automated System for Uniform Recall and Reporting (MEASURE) Users Manual, OP 43P6A. The Chief
of Naval Operations oversees this program and establishes policy and guidelines.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-8. What Navy office oversees the MEASURE program?
Each naval activity must ensure that the test equipment for which it has been assigned primary
</p><p class="paragraph">responsibility is submitted on a timely basis to a calibration activity for required calibration.
</p><p class="paragraph">The MEASURE program is designed to assist these naval activities in the fulfillment of this
responsibility. MEASURE does this by providing for the automatic scheduling and recall of all such test
equipment for calibration.
</p><p class="paragraph">Each activity submits an initial inventory, using the form shown in figure 1-2, to its Metrology
Calibration Representative (METCALREP) for approval. The METCALREP then forwards the inventory
to the Measure Operational Control Center (MOCC). The MOCC, based on the information contained on
these inventory report forms, provides the necessary preprinted Metrology Equipment Recall and
Reporting (METER) card. Figure 1-3 illustrates a MEASURE METER card.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><h3 class="subsection">TEST EQUIPMENT REFERENCES
Several publications that contain information concerning test equipment are required to be
</h3><p class="paragraph">maintained aboard ship by type commander instructions. These requirements are usually found in the
inspection checkoff list. Other publications, while not required by directive, are necessary to you as
reference and study material so you will be able to administer an effective test equipment program.
Technicians should become familiar with the publications/directives listed in appendix II of this module.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-TO-TROUBLESHOOTING-1-11-">INTRODUCTION TO TROUBLESHOOTING
</h2><p class="paragraph">Our military forces increasingly rely on electrical and electronic equipment to help perform their
mission. The effectiveness of our tactical forces depends on many types of electronic systems, such as
communications systems, detection systems, and fire control systems. The reliability of such equipment is
determined by many factors; however, the primary factors are the quality of the equipment in use, the
availability of spare parts, and the ability of maintenance personnel to perform adequate maintenance.
</p><p class="paragraph">Maintenance is work done to correct, reduce, or counteract wear, failure, and damage to equipment.
Maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment is divided into two main categories: PREVENTIVE
(routine) and CORRECTIVE maintenance. Preventive maintenance consists of mechanical, electrical, and
electronic checks to determine whether equipment is operating properly. It also consists of visual
inspections of cabling and equipment for damage and to determine if lubrication is needed. Corrective
maintenance isolates equipment failure by means of test techniques and practices; it also replaces
defective parts and realigns or readjusts equipment to bring it back to proper performance.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-9. What are the two main categories of maintenance?
 Q-10. What type of maintenance involves isolating equipment troubles and replacing defective parts?</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Testing and troubleshooting are the areas of maintenance that require the greatest technical skill.
Testing procedures are referred to as measurements, tests, and checks. The definitions of these terms
often overlap, depending on their use and the results obtained. For example, a power measurement and a
frequency check could constitute a test of the operation of the same radio transmitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Troubleshooting is a term which we in the electronics field use daily. But what does it mean?
Troubleshooting is sometimes thought to be the simple repair of a piece of equipment when it fails to
function properly. This, however, is only part of the picture. In addition to repair, you, as a troubleshooter,
must be able to evaluate equipment performance. You evaluate performance by comparing your
knowledge of how the equipment should operate with the way it is actually performing. You must
evaluate equipment both before and after repairs are accomplished.
</p><p class="paragraph">Equipment performance data, along with other general information for various electronic
equipments, is available to help you in making comparisons. This information is provided in performance
standards books for each piece of equipment. It illustrates what a particular waveform should look like at
a given test point or what amplitude a voltage should be, and so forth. This data aids you in making
intelligent comparisons of current and baseline operating characteristics for the specific equipment
assigned to you for maintenance. ("Baseline" refers to the initial operating conditions of the equipment on
installation or after overhaul when it is operating according to design.)
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember, maintenance refers to all actions you perform on equipment to retain it in a serviceable
condition or to restore it to proper operation. This involves inspecting, testing, servicing, repairing,
rebuilding, and so forth. Proper maintenance can be performed only by trained personnel who are
thoroughly familiar with the equipment. This familiarity requires a thorough knowledge of the theory of
operation of the equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">A logical and systematic approach to troubleshooting is of the utmost importance in your
performance of electronics maintenance. Many hours have been lost because of time-consuming "hit-or-
miss" (often referred to as "easter-egging") methods of troubleshooting.
GENERAL TEST EQUIPMENT INFORMATION
</p><p class="paragraph">In any maintenance training program, one of your most important tasks is to learn the use of test
equipment in all types of maintenance work. To be effective in maintenance work, you must become
familiar not only with the common types of measuring instruments, but also with the more specialized
equipment. Some examples of common types of typical measuring instruments are the ammeter,
voltmeter, and ohmmeter; examples of specialized test equipment are the spectrum analyzer, dual-trace
oscilloscope, and power and frequency meters.
</p><h3 class="subsection">TEST EQUIPMENT SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
The electrical measuring instruments included in test equipment are delicately constructed and
</h3><p class="paragraph">require certain handling precautions to prevent damage and to ensure accurate readings. In addition, to
prevent injury to personnel, you must observe precautions while using test equipment. You can find a list
of applicable instructions in appendix II of this module.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Instrument Precautions
</h3><p class="paragraph">To prevent damage to electrical measuring instruments, you should observe the precautions relating
to three hazards: mechanical shock, exposure to magnetic fields, and excessive current flow.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">MECHANICAL SHOCK.—Instruments contain permanent magnets, meters, and other
components that are sensitive to shock. Heavy vibrations or severe shock can cause these instruments to
lose their calibration accuracy.
</p><p class="paragraph">EXPOSURE TO STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS.—Strong magnetic fields may permanently
impair the accuracy of a test instrument. These fields may impress permanent magnetic effects on
permanent magnets, moving-coil instruments, iron parts of moving-iron instruments, or in the magnetic
materials used to shield instruments.
</p><p class="paragraph">EXCESSIVE CURRENT FLOW.—This includes various precautions, depending on the type of
instrument. When in doubt, use the maximum range scale on the first measurement and shift to lower
range scales only after you verify that the reading can be made on a lower range. If possible, connections
should be made while the circuit is de-energized. All connections should be checked to ensure that the
instrument will not be overloaded before the circuit is reenergized.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Other Instrument Precautions
</h3><p class="paragraph">Precautions to be observed to prevent instrument damage include the following:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Keep in mind that the coils of wattmeters, frequency meters, and power meters may be carrying
large quantities of current even when the meter pointer is on scale.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never open secondaries of current transformers when the primary is energized.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never short-circuit secondaries of potential transformers the primary is energized.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never leave an instrument connected with its pointer off-scale or deflected in the wrong direction.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Ensure that meters in motor circuits can handle the motor starting current. This may be as high as
six to eight times the normal running current.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never attempt to measure the internal resistance of a meter movement with an ohmmeter since
the movement may be damaged by the current output from the ohmmeter.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never advance the intensity control of an oscilloscope to a position that causes an excessively
bright spot on the screen; never permit a sharply focused spot to remain stationary for any period
of time. This results in burn spots on the face of the cathode-ray tube (CRT).
</p><p class="paragraph">• In checking electron tubes with a tube tester that has a separate "short test," always make the
short test first. If the tube is shorted, no further test should be made.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Before measuring resistance, always discharge any capacitors in the circuit to be tested. Note and
record any points not having bleeder resistors or discharge paths for capacitors.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Always disconnect voltmeters from field generating or other highly inductive circuits before you
open the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-11. Which quantity (voltage or current) determines the intensity of an electrical shock?
Situations can arise during the use of test equipment that are extremely dangerous to personnel. For
</p><h3 class="subsection">example, you may have an oscilloscope plugged into one receptacle, an electronic meter plugged into</h3><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">another, and a soldering iron in still another. Also, you may be using an extension cord for some
equipments and not others or may be using other possible combinations. Some of the hazards presented
by situations such as these include contact with live terminals or test leads. In addition, cords and test
leads may be cross connected in such a manner that a potential difference exists between the metal cases
of the instruments. This potential difference may cause serious or fatal shocks.
</p><p class="paragraph">Test leads attached to test equipment should, if possible, extend from the back of the instruments
away from the observer. If this is not possible, they should be clamped to the bench or table near the
instruments.
</p><p class="paragraph">At times, you may use instruments at locations where vibration is present, such as near a diesel
engine. At such times, the instruments should be placed on pads of folded cloth, felt, or similar shock-
absorbing material.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WORKING-ON-ENERGIZED-CIRCUITS-1-14-">WORKING ON ENERGIZED CIRCUITS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Insofar as is practical, you should NOT undertake repair work on energized circuits and equipment.
However, it could become necessary, such as when you make adjustments on operating equipment. In
such cases, obtain permission from your supervisor, then proceed with your work, but carefully observe
the following safety precautions:
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT WORK ALONE.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Station an assistant near the main switch or circuit breaker so the equipment can be immediately
de-energized in case of an emergency.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Someone qualified in first aid for electrical shock should be standing by during the entire
operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Ensure that you have adequate lighting. You must be able to see clearly if you are to perform the
job safely and properly.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Be sure that you are insulated from ground by an approved rubber mat or layers of dry canvas
and/or wood.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Where practical, use only one hand, keeping the other either behind you or in your pocket.
</p><p class="paragraph">• If you expect voltage to exceed 150 volts, wear rubber gloves.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT work on any type of electrical apparatus when you are wearing wet clothing or if your
hands are wet.
</p><p class="paragraph">• DO NOT wear loose or flapping clothing.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The use of thin-soled shoes and shoes with metal plates or hobnails is prohibited.

</p><p class="paragraph">• Remove all rings, wristwatches, bracelets, and similar metal items before working on the
equipment. Also ensure that your clothing does not contain exposed metal fasteners, such as
zippers, snaps, buttons, and pins.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not tamper with interlock switches; that is, do not defeat their purpose by shorting them or
blocking them open.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Ensure that equipment is properly grounded before energizing.
</p><p class="paragraph">• De-energize equipment before attaching alligator clips to any circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Use only approved meters and other indicating devices to check for the presence of voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Observe the following procedures when measuring voltages in excess of 300 volts:
</p><p class="paragraph">� Turn off the equipment power.
</p><p class="paragraph">� Short-circuit or ground the terminals of all components capable of retaining a charge.
</p><p class="paragraph">� Connect the meter leads to the points to be measured.
</p><p class="paragraph">� Remove any terminal grounds previously connected.
</p><p class="paragraph">� Turn on the power and observe the voltage reading.
</p><p class="paragraph">� Turn off the power.
</p><p class="paragraph">� Short circuit or ground all components capable of retaining a charge.
</p><p class="paragraph">� Disconnect the meter leads.
</p><p class="paragraph">• On all circuits where the voltage is in excess of 30 volts and where decks, bulkheads, or
workbenches are made of metal, you should insulate yourself from accidental grounding by using
approved insulating material. The insulating material should have the following qualities:
</p><p class="paragraph">� It should be dry, without holes, and should not contain conducting materials.
</p><p class="paragraph">� The voltage rating for which it is made should be clearly marked on the material. The proper
material should be used so that adequate protection from the voltage can be supplied.
</p><p class="paragraph">� Dry wood may be used or, as an alternative, several layers of dry canvas, sheets of phenolic
(resin or plastic) insulating material, or suitable rubber mats.
</p><p class="paragraph">� Care should be exercised to ensure that moisture, dust, metal chips, and so forth, which may
collect on insulating material, are removed at once. Small deposits of such materials can
become electrical hazards.
</p><p class="paragraph">� All insulating materials on machinery and in the area should be kept free of oil, grease, carbon
dust, and so forth, since such deposits destroy insulation.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

period of time after having been disconnected from the power source.
</p><p class="paragraph">Always assume there is a voltage present when working with circuits having
high capacitance, even when the circuit has been disconnected from its power
source.
</p><p class="paragraph">An approved type of shorting probe should be used to discharge capacitors and
cathode-ray tubes individually.
</p><p class="paragraph">When using the safety shorting probe, always be sure to first connect the test clip to a good ground
(if necessary, scrape the paint off the grounding metal to make a good contact). Then hold the safety
shorting probe by the insulated handle and touch the probe end of the shorting rod to the point to be
shorted out. The probe end is fashioned so that it can be hooked over the part or terminal to provide a
constant connection by the weight of the handle alone. Always take care not to touch any of the metal
parts of the safety shorting probe while touching the probe to the exposed "hot" terminal. It pays to be
safe; use the safety shorting probe with care.

</p><p class="paragraph">• If pertinent, inform the remote station regarding the circuit on which work will be performed.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Use one hand when turning switches on or off.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Safety devices, such as interlocks, overload relays, and fuses, should never be altered or
disconnected except for replacement. In addition, they should never be changed or modified in
any way without specific authorization.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Fuses should be removed and replaced only after the circuit has been de-energized. When a fuse
"blows," the replacement should be of the same type and have the same current and voltage
ratings. A fuse puller should be used to remove and replace cartridge fuses.
</p><p class="paragraph">• All circuit breakers and switches from which power could possibly be supplied should be secured
(locked if possible) in the OPEN or OFF (safe) position and danger tagged in accordance with
procedures in the Standard Organization and Regulations of the U.S. Navy, OPNAVINST
3120.32.
</p><p class="paragraph">• After the work has been completed, the tag (or tags) should be removed only by the same person
who signed it (them) when the work began.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Keep clothing, hands, and feet dry if at all possible. When you must work in wet or damp
locations, place a rubber mat or other nonconductive material on top of a dry, wooden platform or
stool; then use the platform or stool to sit and stand on. Use insulated tools and insulated
flashlights of the molded type when you are required to work on exposed parts.
</p><h3 class="subsection">GROUNDING OF POWER TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT
The possibility of electrical shock can be reduced by ensuring that all motor and generator frames,
</h3><p class="paragraph">metal bases, and other structural parts of electrical and electronic equipment are at ground potential.
</p><p class="paragraph">Normally, on steel-hull vessels, such grounds are inherently provided because the metal cases or
frames of the equipment are in contact with one another and with the metal structure of the vessel. In
some instances where such inherent grounding is not provided by the mounting arrangements, such as
equipment supported on shock mounts, suitable ground connections must be provided.
</p><p class="paragraph">The grounding wire used for this purpose is generally made of flexible material (copper or
aluminum) that provides sufficient current-carrying capacity to ensure an effective ground. In this
manner, equipment cases and frames that are not intended to be above ground potential are effectively
grounded; also, the possibility of electrical shock to personnel coming in contact with metal parts of the
equipment is minimized. The secondary purpose of grounding equipment is to improve the operation and
continuity of service of all equipments.
</p><p class="paragraph">Paint, grease, or other foreign matter can interfere with the positive metal-to-metal contact at the
ground connection point. Therefore, all bonding surfaces (connection points or metallic junctions) must
be securely fastened and free of such matter. In all instances where equipment grounding is provided,
certain general precautions and preventive maintenance measures must be taken. A few of these
precautions are listed below:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-18
</p><p class="paragraph">• Periodically clean all strap-and-clamp connectors to ensure that all direct metal-to-metal contacts
are free from foreign matter.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Check all mounting hardware for mechanical failure or loose connections.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Replace any faulty, rusted, or otherwise unfit grounding strap, clamp, connection, or component
between the equipment and the ground to the ship’s hull.
</p><p class="paragraph">• When replacing a part of the ground connection, make certain that the metallic contact surfaces
are clean and that electrical continuity is re-established.
</p><p class="paragraph">• After completing the foregoing steps, recheck to be sure that the connection is securely fastened
with the correct mounting hardware. Paint the ground strap and hardware in accordance with
current procedures.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of the electrical shock hazards that could be encountered aboard ship, plugs and
convenience outlets for use with portable equipment and power tools normally are standard three-prong
type. Both plugs and outlets are keyed so that the plug must be in the correct position before it can be
inserted into the receptacle. To ensure that the safety factors incorporated in these devices are in
serviceable condition and are safe for use, you must perform the following precautions and inspections:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Inspect the pins of the plug to see that they are firmly in place and are not bent or damaged.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Check the wiring terminals and connections of the plug. Loose connections and frayed wires on
the plug surface must be corrected and any foreign matter removed before the plug is inserted into
the receptacle.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Use a meter to ensure that the ground pin has a resistance of less than 1 ohm equipment ground.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not attempt to insert a grounded-type plug into a grounded receptacle without first aligning
the plug properly.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUTION-1-18-">CAUTION

</h2><p class="paragraph">Electronic measurements involve the fundamental electrical quantities of voltage and current and the
inherent characteristics of resistance, capacitance, and inductance. In circuits being tested, voltage and
current are dependent upon resistance, capacitance, and inductance for their distribution; therefore,
voltage and current measurements are valuable aids in determining circuit component conditions and in
the evaluation of symptoms. Practically any reading obtained from the use of test equipment will depend
on these basic measured quantities of resistance, capacitance, and inductance.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Voltage measurements may be made as part of either preventive or corrective maintenance. These
measurements are made using a voltmeter. When compared with voltage charts, these measurements are a
valuable aid in locating a trouble quickly and easily. However, if the sensitivity of the test voltmeter
differs from that of the voltmeter used in preparing the chart, the voltage measurements must be evaluated
before the true circuit conditions can be determined. (Sensitivity in voltmeters was discussed in NEETS,
Module 3, Introduction to Circuit Protection, Control, and Measurement.)
</p><p class="paragraph">Since many of the troubles you find in equipments and systems are the result of abnormal voltages,
voltage measurements are a valuable aid in locating trouble. You can measure voltage with a voltmeter
without interrupting circuit operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">Point-to-point voltage measurement charts, usually found in equipment technical manuals, contain
the normal operating voltages found in the various stages of the equipment. These voltages are usually
measured between indicated points and ground unless otherwise stated. When you begin recording
voltage measurements, it is a smart and safe practice to set the voltmeter on the highest range before
measuring. This ensures that excessive voltages existing in the circuit will not cause overloading of the
meter.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-13. On what range should you set the voltmeter prior to taking a voltage measurement?
To increase accuracy, you should then set the voltmeter to the appropriate range for the proper
</p><p class="paragraph">comparison with the expected voltage in the voltage charts. When checking voltages, remember that a
voltage reading can be obtained across a resistance, even if that resistance is open. The resistance of the
meter itself forms a circuit resistance when the meter probes are placed across the open resistance.
Therefore, the voltage across the component may appear to be normal or near-normal as you read the
meter, but may actually be abnormal when the meter is disconnected from the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the internal resistance of the voltmeter is approximately the same value as the resistance being
tested, it will indicate a considerably lower voltage than the actual voltage present when the meter is
removed from the circuit. The sensitivity (in ohms per volt) of the voltmeter used to prepare the voltage
charts is provided on those charts. If a meter of similar sensitivity is available, you should use it to reduce
the effects of loading.
</p><p class="paragraph">The following precautions are general safety measures that apply to the measurement of voltages.
Remember that nearly all voltages are dangerous and have often proved fatal to careless technicians.
When measuring voltages, be sure to observe the following precautions:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Set test equipment to the HIGHEST range.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Make sure safety observer knows where to secure power for the equipment under test.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Connect the ground lead of the voltmeter first.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Use only one hand to take measurements (when possible), and put the other hand in your pocket
or behind your back.
</p><p class="paragraph">• If the voltage to be measured is less than 300 volts, place the end of the test probe on the point to
be tested; use the polarity switch to select positive or negative readings.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">• If the voltage to be measured is more than 300 volts, proceed as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph"> 1. Shut off circuit power.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 2. Discharge all filter capacitors with a shorting probe.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 3. Temporarily ground the point to be measured.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 4. Connect (clip on) the proper test lead to the high-voltage point.
 5. Move away from the voltmeter.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 6. Turn on circuit power and read the voltmeter.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 7. Turn off circuit power.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 8. Discharge all capacitors before disconnecting the meter.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-14. When taking a voltage measurement, which lead of the voltmeter should you connect to the circuit
first?
</p><p class="paragraph">Current measurements are not often taken in the course of preventive maintenance or testing. This is
because the ammeter (or other current-measuring instrument) must become an actual part of the
equipment being tested. The circuit must be opened (desoldered) to connect the ammeter in series with
the circuit being tested. Usually, you can take a voltage measurement and use this factor to calculate the
circuit current by applying Ohm’s law.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-15. Is an ammeter connected in series or in parallel with the circuit under test?
RESISTANCE MEASUREMENTS
</p><p class="paragraph">Resistance measurements are a valuable aid to you in locating defective circuits and components
during corrective maintenance. Maintenance handbooks for the equipment can often be used to help you
take these measurements. These handbooks often contain resistance charts that are referenced to
accessible test points within the equipment. Without these charts, taking resistance measurements in a
complex circuit is a slow process. The process is slow because one side of the circuit component must
often be desoldered to get a true resistance measurement. However, resistance tolerances vary so widely
that approximate resistance readings are adequate for most jobs.
</p><p class="paragraph">Once the most accessible test point is found, an ohmmeter is usually used to take the resistance
measurement. Because of the degree of accuracy needed when an ohmmeter is used, proper calibration
and understanding of the meter scales is a must. (Topic 2 of this module will discuss these requirements
in detail.) When using an ohmmeter, you must observe the following precautions:
</p><p class="paragraph">• The circuit being tested must be completely de-energized.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Any meters or transistors which can be damaged by the ohmmeter current must be removed
before any measurement is made.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-16. What must be done to a circuit before you can use an ohmmeter for testing?</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAPACITANCE-MEASUREMENTS-1-21-">CAPACITANCE MEASUREMENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Capacitance measurements are usually taken with a capacitance meter. Capacitance tolerances vary
even more widely than resistance tolerances. Capacitance tolerances depend on the type of capacitor, the
value of capacitance, and the voltage rating. The actual measurement of capacitance is very simple;
however, you must make the important decision of whether to reject or to continue to use the capacitor
after it has been tested.
</p><p class="paragraph">The POWER FACTOR of a capacitor is important because it is an indication of the various losses of
a capacitor. Power losses can be traced to the dielectric, such as current leakage and dielectric absorption.
Current leakage is of considerable importance, especially in electrolytic capacitors.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-17. What is the term used to refer to the losses which can be traced to the dielectric of a capacitor?
INDUCTANCE MEASUREMENTS
</p><p class="paragraph">Inductance measurements are seldom required in the course of troubleshooting. However, inductance
measurements are useful in some cases; therefore, bridges (discussed in the next section) are available for
making this test. You will find that many capacitance test sets can be used to measure inductance. Most
capacitance test sets are furnished with inductance conversion charts if the test equipment scale is not
calibrated to read the value of inductance directly.
</p><h3 class="subsection">CAPACITANCE, INDUCTANCE, AND RESISTANCE BRIDGES
</h3><p class="paragraph">You can measure capacitance, inductance, and resistance for precise accuracy by using ac bridges.
These bridges are composed of capacitors, inductors, and resistors in a wide variety of combinations.
These bridges are operated on the principle of a dc bridge called a WHEATSTONE BRIDGE.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Wheatstone Bridge
</h3><p class="paragraph">The Wheatstone bridge is widely used for precision measurements of resistance. The circuit diagram
for a Wheatstone bridge is shown in figure 1-5. Resistors R1, R2, and R3 are precision, variable resistors.
The value of Rx is an unknown value of resistance that must be determined. After the bridge has been
properly balanced (galvanometer G reads zero), the unknown resistance may be determined by means of a
simple formula. The galvanometer (an instrument that measures small amounts of current) is inserted
across terminals b and d to indicate the condition of balance. When the bridge is properly balanced, no
difference in potential exists across terminals b and d; when switch S2 is closed, the galvanometer
reading is zero.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-22
</p><p class="paragraph">The operation of the bridge is explained in a few logical steps. When the battery switch S1 is closed,
electrons flow from the negative terminal of the battery to point a. Here the current divides as it would in
any parallel circuit. Part of it passes through R1 and R2; the remainder passes through R3 and Rx. The
two currents, I1 and I2, unite at point c and return to the positive terminal of the battery. The value of I1
depends on the sum of resistance R1 and R2, and the value of I2 depends on the sum of resistances R3 and
Rx. In each case, according to Ohm’s law, the current is inversely proportional to the resistance.
</p><p class="paragraph">R1, R2, and R3 are adjusted so that when S1 is closed, no current flows through G. When the
galvanometer shows no deflection, there is no difference of potential between points b and d. All of I
</p><p class="paragraph"> 1
follows the a b c path and all I2 follows the a b c path. This means that a voltage drop E1 (across R1
between points a and b) is the same as voltage drop E3 (across R3 between points a and d). Similarly, the
voltage drops across R2 and Rx (E2 and Ex) are also equal. Expressed algebraically,
</p><h3 class="subsection">and
</h3><p class="paragraph">With this information, we can figure the value of the unknown resistor Rx. Divide the voltage drops
across R1 and R3 by their respective voltage drops across R2 and Rx as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">We can simplify this equation:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Use of ac Bridges
</h3><p class="paragraph">A wide variety of ac bridge circuits (such as the Wheatstone) may be used for the precision
measurement of ac resistance, capacitance, and inductance. Let’s look at ac bridges in terms of functions
they perform.
</p><p class="paragraph">RESISTANCE BRIDGE.—An ac signal generator, as shown in figure 1-6, is used as the source of
voltage. Current from the generator passes through resistors R1 and R2, which are known as the ratio
arms, and through Rs and Rx. Again, Rx is known as resistance. Rs has a standard value and replaces R3 in
figure 1-6. When the voltage drops across R2 and Rs are equal, the voltage drops across R2 and Rx are
also equal; no difference of potential exists across the meter and no current flows through it. As we
discovered with the Wheatstone bridge, when no voltage appears across the meter, the following ratio is
true:
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, if in figure 1-6 we know that R1 is 20 ohms, R2 is 40 ohms, and Rs is 60 ohms, we can
find the value of Rx using our formula as follows:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">With the ac signal applied to the bridge, R1 and R2 are varied until a zero reading is seen on the
meter. Zero deflection indicates that the bridge is balanced. (NOTE: In actual practice, the variables are
adjusted for a minimum reading since the phase difference between the two legs will not always allow a
zero reading.)
</p><p class="paragraph">CAPACITANCE BRIDGE.—Because current varies inversely with resistance and directly with
capacitance, an inverse proportion exists between the four arms of the bridge in figure 1-7; the right side
of our expression is inverted from the resistance bridge expression as follows:
</p><h3 class="subsection">or
</h3><p class="paragraph"> Q-18. What effect does an increase in capacitance have on a capacitor’s opposition to current flow?
Because R1 and R2 are expressed in the same units, the equation R1/R2 becomes a simple
</p><p class="paragraph">multiplication factor. This equation provides a numerical value for Cx and will be in the same units as Cs
(farad, microfarad, and so forth).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

of the simple bridge circuit shown in figure 1-8. Ratio arms R1 and R2 are accurately calibrated resistors.

equipment. The determination of dc power is fairly simple; recall that the unit of power, the watt, is the
product of the potential in volts and the current in amperes (P = E ·  I).
</p><p class="paragraph">As discussed in NEETS, Module 2, Introduction to Alternating Current and Transformers, the phase
angle of the voltage and current must be considered for accurate ac power measurements. The
measurement of ac power is further complicated by the frequency limitations of various power meters. If
there is no phase angle difference, you can compute ac power in the same manner as dc power; that is, by
determining the effective value of the product of the voltage and current.
</p><p class="paragraph">For equipments that operate in the audio-frequency (af) range, power levels have to be determined in
the performance of routine checks and during corrective maintenance procedures.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Power measurements for af circuits are usually indicated in terms of decibels (dB) or decibels
referenced to 1 milliwatt (dBm). Because the actual calculation of decibel measurements is seldom
required, the following explanation is somewhat simplified. Most test equipment is designed to measure
and indicate decibels directly. This eliminates the need for you to perform complicated calculations.
Nevertheless, a basic explanation of the decibel measurement system is necessary for you to understand
the significance of dB readings and amplifier-gain ratings that are expressed in decibels.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-DECIBEL-SYSTEM-2-2-">THE DECIBEL SYSTEM
</h2><p class="paragraph">The basic unit of measurement in the system is not the decibel; it is the bel. The bel is a unit that
expresses the logarithmic ratio between the input and the output of any given component, circuit, or
system. It may be expressed in terms of voltage, current, or power. Most often, it is used to show the ratio
between input and output power to figure gain. You can express the power gain of the amplifier (N) in
bels by dividing the output (P1) by the input (P2) and taking the base 10 logarithm of the resulting
quotient. The formula for determining this gain is:
</p><p class="paragraph">If an amplifier doubles the input power, the quotient of P1 to P2 will be 2. If you consult a logarithm
table, you will find that the base 10 logarithm of 2 is 0.3, making the power gain of the amplifier 0.3 bel.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-1. What is the logarithmic ratio between the input and output of a given circuit called?
Experience has shown that because the bel is a rather large unit, it is difficult to apply. A more
</p><p class="paragraph">practical unit, and one that can be used more easily, is the decibel (1/10 bel). You can convert any figure
expressed in bels to decibels by multiplying that figure by 10 or simply by moving the decimal point one
place to the right. Applying this rule, we find that the above ratio of 0.3 bel is equal to 3 decibels.
</p><p class="paragraph">The decibel (dB) cannot be used to represent actual power; only the ratio of one power compared to
another. To say that an amplifier has a 3 dB gain means that the output power is twice the input power.
This gives no indication of the actual power represented. You must be able to state the input power for it
to be meaningful. In many applications, a mathematical expression represents the actual power, not a
power ratio. One standard reference is the dBm.
</p><p class="paragraph">The dBm is an abbreviation used to represent power levels above or below 1 milliwatt. Negative
dBm ( - dBm) represents power levels below 1 milliwatt, and positive dBm (+dBm) represents power
levels above 1 milliwatt. In other words, a dBm value is a specific amount of power; 0 dBm is equal to 1
milliwatt. Briefly stated, the amount of power in a given value of dBm is the power which results if 1
milliwatt is amplified or attenuated by that dB value. For example, 40 dBm represents an actual power
level (watts or milliwatts) that is 40 dB above 1 milliwatt, whereas - 10 dBm represents a power level that
is 10 dB below 1 milliwatt. The formula for finding dBm is a variation of the dB power formula:
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-2. What term is used to represent power levels above or below a 1-milliwatt reference?</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">You do not need to use the formula in most applications. The following shows conversions of dBm
to mW:
</p><p class="paragraph">+20dBm = 100mW
+10dBm = 10mW
+7dBm = 5mW
+6dBm = 4mW
+4dBm = 2.5mW
+3dBm = 2mW
0dBm = 1mW
-3dBm = .5mW
-10dBm = .1mW
</p><p class="paragraph">For a +10 dBm level, start with the 1 milliwatt reference and move the decimal point one place to the
right (+10 dBm = 10 mW). Another 10 dB increment brings the power level to +20 dBm, thereby moving
the decimal point another place to the right (+20 dBm = 100 mW). For a - 10 dBm level, again start with
1 milliwatt, but this time move the decimal point one place to the left ( - 10 dBm = .1 mW). An additional
10 dB decrease results in another decimal point shift to the left ( - 20 dBm = .01 mW).
</p><p class="paragraph">For a 3 dB increase, you double the power. For a 3 dB decrease, you reduce the power by one-half
(+3 dBm = 2 mW and - 3 dBm = .5 mW). A +6 dBm level is an additional 3 dB change from +3 dBm. In
this case, you just double the power level of the +3 dBm (+6 dBm = 4 mW).
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-3. What milliwatt value is equal to +6 dBm?
The dB change can be made in either direction. For example, +7 dBm is a decrease from +10 dBm.
</p><p class="paragraph">Reducing the +10 dBm power by one-half, we have +7 dBm, or 5 mW. A +4 dBm power level is a 3 dB
decrease from +7 dBm (+4 dBm -  2.5 mW). By using this simple method, you can quickly find any
power level that corresponds to a given dBm.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some test instruments you will be using are calibrated in decibels and have a 1 milliwatt zero
reference level. Figure 2-1 illustrates such an instrument. Notice that this is an ac voltmeter in which the
upper scale of the meter indicates ac voltage and the lower scale indicates decibels. The zero power-level
indicator on the decibel scale is located at, or near, center scale. If the power in the line being measured is
more than the reference value, the meter will indicate a value to the right of the zero mark (+dB). If the
power is less than the reference value, the meter will indicate a value to the left of the zero mark ( - dB).
Such meters are useful when recording measurements where a direct indication in decibels is desired.
However, you must remember that this meter is still a voltmeter and that power measurements are not
meaningful unless the circuit impedance is known. If you feel the need to review how to calculate power
in ac circuits, refer to NEETS, Module 2.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MEASUREMENT-METHODS-2-4-">MEASUREMENT METHODS
</h2><p class="paragraph">At radio frequencies below the UHF range, power is usually determined by voltage, current, and
impedance measurements. One common method used to determine the output power of radio-frequency
(rf) oscillators and radio transmitters consists of connecting a known resistance to the equipment output
terminals. Current flowing through this resistance is then measured and the power is calculated as the
product of I2R.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because power is proportional to the current squared, the meter scale can be calibrated to indicate
power units directly. A THERMOCOUPLE AMMETER can be used in this manner for measuring rf
power. The resistor used to replace the normal load is specially designed to have low reactance and the
ability to dissipate the required amount of power. Such resistors are commonly called DUMMY LOADS
or DUMMY ANTENNAS.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-4. What name is given to a resistor used to replace the normal load in a circuit?
In the UHF and SHF frequency ranges, accurately measuring the voltage, current, and resistance is
</p><p class="paragraph">difficult. These basic measurements can vary greatly, depending on where in the circuit the measurements
are made. They are also affected by small changes in parts placement in the vicinity of tuned circuits.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">2-5
</p><p class="paragraph">To measure the output of microwave radio or radar transmitters, you can use test instruments that
convert rf power to another form of energy, such as light or heat. These instruments can be used to
indirectly measure the power. A method used to measure the effect of a resistor load on a stream of
passing air can also be used to indirectly measure power. Accurate measurement of large-magnitude
power also can be achieved by measuring the temperature change of a water load. The most common type
of power meter for use in this frequency range employs a BOLOMETER.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Bolometer
</h3><p class="paragraph">The bolometer is a loading device that undergoes changes of resistance as changes in dissipated
power occur. The two types of bolometers are the BARRETTER and the THERMISTOR. The barretter is
characterized by an increase in resistance as the dissipated power rises. The thermistor decreases in
resistance as the power increases. In either case, resistance is measured before and after the application of
rf power. If the same change in resistance is then produced by a variable dc source of power, then the rf
power is equal to the measured dc power. This relationship makes possible the direct calibration of a
bridge circuit in units of power. In other words, one condition of balance exists when no rf power is
applied; but in the presence of power, a second condition of balance exists because of the resistance
changes of the bolometer. It is this change of resistance that is calibrated in power.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-5. What are the two types of bolometers?
BARRETTER.—The construction of a typical barretter is shown in figure 2-2. The fine wire
</p><p class="paragraph">(usually tungsten) is extremely small in diameter. This thin diameter allows the rf current to penetrate to
the center of the wire. The wire is supported in an insulating capsule between two metallic ends, which
act as connectors. Because of these physical characteristics, the barretter resembles a cartridge-type fuse.
The enclosure is a quartz capsule made in two parts. One part is an insert cemented in place after the
tungsten wire has been mounted. In operation, the barretter is matched to the rf line after power is applied.
</p><p class="paragraph">THERMISTOR.—A high degree of precision is made possible by the thermistor; therefore, it is
widely used. Figure 2-3 shows the typical construction of a bead-type thermistor. The negative-
temperature coefficient comes from the use of a semiconductor as the active material. Notice that the</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">active material is shaped in the form of a bead. It is supported between two pigtail leads by connecting
wires. The pigtail ends are embedded in the ends of the surrounding glass capsule.
</p><p class="paragraph">The negative-resistance temperature coefficient of thermistors is desirable. This is because excessive
power has the effect of changing the resistance of the thermistor to an extent that causes a pronounced rf
mismatch. The resulting decrease in power transfer reduces the likelihood of burnout.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Thermistor Bridge
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-4, views A and B, is an example of a THERMISTOR BRIDGE used for rf power
measurements. A thermistor bridge circuit includes other thermistor elements, referred to as
compensating thermistors. These thermistors respond to fluctuations in ambient temperature so that the
bridge balances and calibration are maintained over a wide temperature range. Compensating thermistors
are usually in disc form so that they can be mounted on a flat metal surface, such as a chassis or a
waveguide. The thermistor bridge in view B is located in the terminating section of a waveguide and
contains RT-2, a bead thermistor, and two compensating thermistors, RT-1 and RT-3, on the outside of
the waveguide (view A). RA-1 in view B, a calibrated attenuator, controls the amount of rf energy applied
to RT-2.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Before power is applied, R1 and R2 in view A of figure 2-4 are used to adjust the current through
RT-2. When the resistance of RT-2 reaches the equivalent parallel resistance of R6 and RT1 (122.4
ohms), the bridge is balanced. Meter M-1 reads 0 at this time. The rf signal being measured is connected
to the test set and applied via the calibrated attenuator to RT-2. This causes the temperature of RT-2 to
increase, thus reducing its resistance. The bridge becomes unbalanced, causing meter M-1 to deflect an
amount proportional to the decrease in resistance of RT-2. Meter M-1, because of the operation of RT-2,
reads average power.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-6. As the dissipated power increases, what effect does this have on the resistance of a thermistor?
If the ambient temperature rises, the resistance of RT-1 decreases. This shunts more current around
</p><p class="paragraph">the bridge network and allows RT-2 to cool. The resistance of RT-3 decreases, maintaining meter
sensitivity independent of temperature changes. Cavity Z-1 in view B of figure 2-4 is an ABSORPTION-
TYPE FREQUENCY METER. This type of meter will be discussed later.

Frequency measurements are an essential part of preventive and corrective maintenance for electric

</p><p class="paragraph">• The output frequency of electric power generators is checked when the engine is started and
during preventive maintenance routines.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Equipment that operates in the af range must be adjusted to operate at the correct frequencies.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Radio transmitters must be accurately tuned to the assigned frequencies to provide reliable
communications and to avoid interference with radio circuits operating on other frequencies.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Radar sets must be properly tuned to obtain satisfactory performance.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see from the above examples, frequency measurement does indeed play a valuable role in
maintenance. These measurements can be divided into two broad categories: MECHANICAL-
ROTATION FREQUENCY measurement and ELECTRICAL-OUTPUT FREQUENCY measurement.
Depending upon your job and/or the type of command to which you are assigned, you may be tasked with
performing one or both of these types of measurements.
</p><h3 class="subsection">MECHANICAL-ROTATION FREQUENCY MEASUREMENT
The rotating frequency (speed in revolutions per minute) of armatures in electric motors and engine-
</h3><p class="paragraph">driven generators, as well as the blade speed in turbines, is measured with devices called
TACHOMETERS, STROBOSCOPES, and STROBOTACS.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tachometer
</h3><p class="paragraph">A tachometer is an instrument that measures the rate at which a shaft is turning. Although
tachometers are installed on machinery, such as generators and engines, you may need to determine the
speed of a rotating machine that is not equipped with a tachometer. In these instances, you will be
required to use a PORTABLE TACHOMETER. Portable hand-held tachometers measure speed by direct
contact with the shaft of the measured unit. Portable tachometers are for use only during testing and
should not be used continuously. The common types of portable tachometers are the CENTRIFUGAL
and the CHRONOMETRIC.
</p><p class="paragraph">CENTRIFUGAL TACHOMETER.—A centrifugal-type tachometer is illustrated in figure 2-5,
view A. View B shows the internal arrangement of the centrifugal tachometer; refer to view B in this
discussion. In the centrifugal tachometer, centrifugal force acts upon fly weights that are connected by
links to upper and lower collars. The upper collar is affixed to a drive shaft; the lower collar is free to
move up and down the shaft. A spring, which fits over the shaft, connects the upper and lower collars.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Each portable centrifugal tachometer has a small rubber-covered wheel and a number of hard rubber
tips. You fit the appropriate tip or wheel on the end of the tachometer drive shaft, and hold it against the
shaft to measure speed of rotation. As the drive shaft begins to rotate, the fly weights rotate with it.
Centrifugal force tends to pull the fly weights away from the center, causing the lower collar to rise and
compress the spring. The lower collar is attached to a pointer, and its upward motion, restricted by the
spring tension, causes an increase in the indication on the dial face.
</p><p class="paragraph">When properly used, a centrifugal tachometer will indicate correct shaft speed as long as it is in
contact with the machine shaft under test. A portable centrifugal tachometer has three ranges: low (50 to
500 rpm), medium (500 to 5,000 rpm), and high (5,000 to 50,000 rpm).
</p><p class="paragraph">CHRONOMETRIC TACHOMETER.—The chronometric tachometer (figure 2-6) is a
combination watch and revolution counter. It measures the average number of revolutions of a shaft per
minute. The chronometric tachometer also comes with hard rubber tips, which must be inserted over the
drive shaft.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When applied to a rotating shaft, the outer drive shaft of this tachometer runs free until a starting
button is depressed to start the timing element. In figure 2-6, note the starting button beneath the index
finger. The chronometric tachometer retains readings on its dial after its drive shaft has been disengaged
from a rotating shaft and until the pointers are returned to 0 by the reset button (usually the starting
button). The range of a chronometric tachometer is usually from 0 to 10,000 rpm and from 0 to 3,000 feet
per minute (fpm).
Stroboscope
</p><p class="paragraph">The rotation frequencies of recording devices and teletypewriter motors can be measured by the use
of a STROBOSCOPE. The stroboscope is an instrument that allows you to view rotating or reciprocating
objects intermittently and produces the optical effect of a slowing down or stopping motion. For example,
electric fan blades revolving at 1,800 rpm will appear stationary if you look at them under a light that
flashes uniformly 1,800 times per minute. At 1,799 flashes per minute, the blades will appear to rotate
forward at 1 rpm; at 1,801 flashes per minute, they will appear to rotate backward at 1 rpm.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the flashing rate of the light is adjustable, you can calibrate the control in flashes (or
revolutions) per minute. The stationary image you see when the rate of the lamp and the rotational rate of
a shaft are equal lets you record a very precise speed measurement.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Strobotac
</h3><p class="paragraph">The STROBOTAC (figure 2-7) is an electronic flash device in which the flash duration is very short
(a few millionths of a second). (Table 2-1 contains a description of the controls and indicators shown on
the strobotac in figure 2-7.) Because of this short flash duration, the strobotac can measure very rapid
motion. The box contains a swivel mount with a STROBOTRON LAMP in a reflector, an electronic
pulse generator to control the flashing rate, and a power supply that operates from the ac power line. The
flashing rate is controlled by the large knob; the corresponding speed (rpm) is indicated on an illuminated
dial that is viewed through windows in the knob.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

All alternating voltage sources are generated at a set frequency or range of frequencies. A

ac power generators can be measured by a vibrating reed, a tuned circuit, or by a crossed-coil, iron-vane
type meter. The vibrating-reed device is the simplest type of frequency meter. It has the advantage of
being rugged enough to be mounted on generator control panels.
</p><p class="paragraph">A simplified diagram of a vibrating-reed frequency meter is shown in figure 2-8, views A through D.
In view A, you can see that the current to be measured flows through the coil and exerts maximum
attraction on the soft-iron armature twice during each cycle. The armature is attached to the bar, which is
mounted on a flexible support. Reeds of suitable dimensions to have natural vibration frequencies of 110,
112, 114, and so forth, up to 130 hertz are mounted on the bar (view B). The reed with a frequency of 110
hertz is marked 55 hertz; the one with a frequency of 112 hertz is marked 56 hertz; the one with a
frequency of 120 hertz is marked 60 hertz, and so forth.

through a larger amplitude. The frequency is read from the scale value opposite the reed having the
greatest amplitude of vibration.
</p><p class="paragraph">In some instruments, the reeds are the same length; but they are weighted by different amounts at the
top so they will have different natural rates of vibration. An end view of the reeds in the indicator is
shown in view C. If the energizing current has a frequency of 60 hertz, the reed marked 60 will vibrate the
greatest amount, as shown. View D shows a hand-held vibrating-reed frequency meter mounted on the
casing of a motor-generator.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tuned Circuits
</h3><p class="paragraph">TUNED CIRCUITS are used as filters for the passage or rejection of specific frequencies.
BANDPASS FILTERS and BAND-REJECT FILTERS are examples of this type. Tuned circuits have
certain characteristics that make them ideal for certain types of filters, especially where a high degree of
selectivity is desired. A series-tuned circuit offers a low impedance to currents of the particular frequency
to which the circuit is tuned and a relatively high impedance to currents of all other frequencies. A
parallel-tuned circuit, on the other hand, offers a very high impedance to currents of its natural, or
resonant, frequency and a relatively low impedance to others. If you feel you need to review the subject of
tuned circuits at this time, refer to NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-
Shaping Circuits, for more information on these circuits and their applications.
</p><h3 class="subsection">AUDIO FREQUENCIES
Frequency measurements in the af range can be made by the comparison method or the direct-
</h3><p class="paragraph">reading frequency meter. Frequency comparisons can be made by the use of a calibrated af generator in
conjunction with either an oscilloscope or a modulator and a zero-beat indicating device. Direct-reading
frequency measurements can be made by instruments using series, frequency-selective electrical
networks, bridge test sets having null indicators, or counting-type frequency meters.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Heterodyne Frequency Meters
</h3><p class="paragraph">Heterodyne frequency meters are available in several varieties. They measure the frequency of the
unknown signal by matching the unknown signal with a locally generated signal of the same frequency
obtained from a calibrated, precision oscillator. This method is normally referred to as  zero beating.
When a perfect frequency match is obtained, it is indicated by the absence of a beat note (zero beat). The
technician generally uses a set of headphones to detect a zero-beat condition in the equipment being
tested.
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic heterodyne meter (figure 2-9) is a calibrated variable oscillator, which heterodynes against
the frequency to be measured. Coupling is accomplished between the frequency meter and the output of
the equipment under test. (NOTE: This coupling should be in accordance with the step-by-step
procedures listed in the technical manual for the frequency meter.) The calibrated oscillator is then tuned
so that the difference between the oscillator frequency and the unknown frequency is in the af range. This
difference in frequency is known as the BEAT FREQUENCY. As the two frequencies are brought closer
to the same value, the tone in the headset will decrease in pitch until it is replaced by a series of rapid
clicks. As the process is continued, the clicks will decrease in rapidity until they stop altogether. This is
the point of zero beat; that is, the point at which the frequency generated in the oscillator of the frequency
meter is equal to the frequency of the unknown signal being measured.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-7. In a heterodyne-type frequency meter, what is the difference between the oscillator frequency and
the unknown frequency?
</p><p class="paragraph">For all practical purposes, the point of zero beat can be assumed when the clicks are heard at
infrequent intervals. Figure 2-10 illustrates the zero-beat concept. Maintaining a condition of absolute
silence in the earphones is extremely difficult when you are making this measurement. When the
incoming signal is strong, the clicks are sharp and distinct. When the signal is weak, the zero-beat
condition is evidenced by a slowly changing "swishing" or "rushing" sound in the headset. After the zero
beat is obtained, the dial reading corresponds to the frequency measured.

</p><p class="paragraph">The manufacturer’s calibration book is a very important part of the frequency meter package; in fact,
the book is so important that it bears the same serial number as the heterodyne-type frequency meter
itself. Contained in this book is a list of the dial settings and the corresponding frequencies produced by
that meter at those dial settings. Operating instructions for the meter are also included.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Absorption Wavemeter
</h3><p class="paragraph">WAVEMETERS are calibrated resonant circuits used to measure frequency. The accuracy of
wavemeters is not as high as that of heterodyne-type frequency meters; however, they have the advantage
of being comparatively simple and can be easily carried.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-8. What equipment uses a calibrated resonant circuit to measure frequency?
Any type of resonant circuit can be used in wavemeter applications. The exact kind of circuit used
</p><p class="paragraph">depends on the frequency range for which the meter is intended. Resonant circuits consisting of coils and
capacitors are used for VLF through VHF wavemeters.
</p><p class="paragraph">The simplified illustration of an absorption wavemeter, shown in figure 2-11, consists of a pickup
coil, a fixed capacitor, a lamp, a variable capacitor, and a calibrated dial. When the wavemeter’s
components are at resonance, maximum current flows in the loop, illuminating the lamp to maximum
brilliance. The calibrated dial setting is converted to a frequency by means of a chart, or graph, in the
instruction manual. If the lamp glows very brightly, the wavemeter should be coupled more loosely to the
circuit. For greatest accuracy, the wavemeter should be coupled so that its indicator lamp provides only a
faint glow when tuned to the resonant frequency.
</p><h3 class="subsection">FREQUENCIES ABOVE THE AUDIO RANGE
The signal frequencies of radio and radar equipments that operate in the UHF and SHF ranges can be
</h3><p class="paragraph">measured by resonant, cavity-type wavemeters or resonant, coaxial-line-type wavemeters. When properly
calibrated, resonant-cavity and resonant-coaxial line wavemeters are more accurate and have better
stability than wavemeters used for measurements in the LF to VHF ranges. These frequency-measuring
instruments are often furnished as part of the equipment. They are also available as general-purpose test
sets.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the type most commonly used. Only this type is discussed in some detail.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Cavity Wavemeter
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-12 shows a typical CAVITY WAVEMETER. The wavemeter is of the type commonly used
for the measurement of microwave frequencies. The device uses a resonant cavity. The resonant
frequency of the cavity is varied by means of a plunger, which is mechanically connected to a micrometer
mechanism. Movement of the plunger into the cavity reduces the cavity size and increases the resonant
frequency. Conversely, an increase in the size of the cavity (made by withdrawing the plunger) lowers the
resonant frequency. The microwave energy from the equipment being tested is fed into the wavemeter
through one of two inputs, A or B. The crystal rectifier then detects (rectifies) the signal. The rectified
current is indicated on current meter M.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Electronic Frequency Counters
</h3><p class="paragraph">Another device used to measure frequencies above the audio range is the ELECTRONIC
FREQUENCY COUNTER. Since this instrument will be covered in detail in a later chapter, only a brief
description is provided at this time.
</p><p class="paragraph">The electronic frequency counter is a high-speed electronic counter with an accurate, crystal-
controlled time base. This combination provides a frequency counter that automatically counts and
displays the number of events occurring in a precise time interval. The frequency counter itself does not
generate any signal; it merely counts the recurring pulses fed to it.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">WAVEFORM ANALYSIS can be made by observing displays of voltage and current variations with
respect to time or by harmonic analysis of complex signals. Waveform displays are particularly valuable
for adjusting and testing pulse-generating, pulse-forming, and pulse-amplifying circuits. The waveform
visual display is also useful for determining signal distortion, phase shift, modulation factor, frequency,
and peak-to-peak voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">Waveform analysis is used in various electrical and electronic equipment troubleshooting. This
section will briefly discuss the oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer to provide you with basic knowledge
of this test equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-9. Name two instruments used to analyze waveforms.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-USE-OF-THE-OSCILLOSCOPE-2-17-">USE OF THE OSCILLOSCOPE
</h2><p class="paragraph">The CATHODE-RAY OSCILLOSCOPE (CRO or O-SCOPE) is commonly used for the analysis of
waveforms generated by electronic equipment. Several types of cathode-ray oscilloscopes are available
for making waveform analysis. The oscilloscope required for a particular test is determined by
characteristics such as input-frequency response, input impedance, sensitivity, sweep rate, and the
methods of sweep control. The SYNCHROSCOPE is an adaptation of the cathode-ray oscilloscope. It
features a wide-band amplifier, triggered sweep, and retrace blanking circuits. These circuits are desirable
for the analysis of pulse waveforms.
</p><p class="paragraph">Oscilloscopes are also part of some harmonic analysis test equipments that display harmonic energy
levels. To effectively analyze waveform displays, you must know the correct wave shape. The
maintenance instructions manual for each piece of equipment illustrates what waveforms you should
observe at the various test points throughout the equipment. Waveforms that will be observed at any one
selected test point will differ; each waveform will depend on whether the operation of the equipment is
normal or abnormal.
</p><p class="paragraph">The display observed on a cathode-ray oscilloscope is ordinarily one similar to those shown in figure
2-13. Views A and B show the instantaneous voltage of the wave plotted against time. Elapsed time (view
A) is indicated by horizontal distance, from left to right, across the etched grid (graticule) placed over the
face of the tube. The amplitude (view B) of the wave is measured vertically on the graph.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

electric circuits. For example, if you need to see the changes in waveform of an electric current, you must
first send the current through a small resistor. You can then use the oscilloscope to view the voltage wave
across the resistor. Other quantities, such as temperatures, pressures, speeds, and accelerations, can be
translated into voltages by means of suitable transducers and then viewed on the oscilloscope. A detailed
discussion of the oscilloscope is presented in chapter 6 of this module.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The SPECTRUM ANALYZER is a device that sweeps over a band of frequencies to determine (1)
what frequencies are being produced by a specific circuit under test and (2) the amplitude of each
frequency component. To accomplish this, the spectrum analyzer first presents a pattern on a display.
Then the relative amplitudes of the various frequencies of the spectrum of the pattern are plotted (see
figure 2-14). On the vertical, or Y axis, the amplitudes are plotted; on the horizontal, or X axis, the
frequencies (time base) are plotted. The overall pattern of this display indicates the proportion of power

the displayed frequency spectrum enables you to determine the degree of efficiency of the equipment
under test. With experience, you will be able to determine definite areas of malfunctioning components
within equipment. In any event, successful spectrum analysis depends on the proper operation of a
spectrum analyzer and your ability to correctly interpret the displayed frequencies. Later, in chapter 6, we
will discuss the various controls, indicators, and connectors contained on the spectrum analyzer.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TESTING-SEMICONDUCTOR-DEVICES-2-19-">TESTING SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES
</h2><p class="paragraph">Because of the reliability of semiconductor devices, servicing techniques developed for
transistorized equipment differ from those normally used for electron-tube circuits. Electron tubes are
usually considered to be the circuit component most susceptible to failure and are normally the first
components to be tested. Transistors, however, are capable of operating in excess of 30,000 hours at
maximum rating without failure. They are often soldered in the circuit in much the same manner as
resistors and capacitors. Therefore, they are NOT so quickly removed for testing as tubes.

equipment section where trouble has been localized, the semiconductor replacement method becomes
cumbersome. Several semiconductors may have to be replaced before the trouble is corrected. To
determine which stage(s) failed and which semiconductors are not defective, you must test all the
removed semiconductors. You can do this by observing whether the equipment operates correctly as you
reinsert each of the removed semiconductor devices into the equipment.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TESTING-DIODES-2-20-">TESTING DIODES
</h2><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor diodes, such as general-purpose germanium and silicon diodes, power silicon diodes,
and microwave silicon diodes, can be tested effectively under actual operating conditions. However,
crystal-rectifier testers are available to determine dc characteristics that provide an indication of crystal-
diode quality.
</p><p class="paragraph">A common type of crystal-diode test set is a combination ohmmeter-ammeter. Measurements of
forward resistance, back resistance, and reverse current can be made with this equipment. Using the
results of these measurements, you can determine the relative condition of these components by
comparing their measured values with typical values obtained from test information furnished with the
test set or from the manufacturer’s data sheets. A check that provides a rough indication of the rectifying
property of a diode is the comparison of the back-and-forward resistance of the diode at a specified
voltage. A typical back-to-forward-resistance ratio is on the order of 10 to 1, and a forward-resistance
value of 50 to 80 ohms is common.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-11. What is the typical back-to-forward resistance ratio of a good-quality diode?
Testing Diodes with an Ohmmeter
</p><p class="paragraph">A convenient test for a semiconductor diode requires only an ohmmeter. The back-and-forward
resistance can be measured at a voltage determined by the battery potential of the ohmmeter and the
resistance range at which the meter is set. When the test leads of the ohmmeter are connected to the diode,
a resistance will be measured that is different from the resistance indicated if the leads are reversed. The
smaller value is called the FORWARD RESISTANCE, and the larger value is called the BACK
RESISTANCE. If the ratio of back-to-forward resistance is greater than 10 to 1, the diode should be
capable of functioning as a rectifier. However, keep in mind that this is a very limited test that does not
take into account the action of the diode at voltages of different magnitudes and frequencies. (NOTE:
This test should never be used to test crystal mixer diodes in radars. It will destroy their sensitivity.)
Testing Diodes with Oscilloscopes
</p><p class="paragraph">An oscilloscope can be used to graphically display the back-and-forward resistance characteristics of
a crystal diode. A circuit used in conjunction with an oscilloscope to make this test is shown in figure 2-
15. This circuit uses the oscilloscope line-test voltage as the test signal. A series circuit (composed of
resistor R1 and the internal resistance in the line-test circuit) decreases a 3-volt, open-circuit test voltage
to a value of approximately 2 volts peak to peak.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

oscilloscope. The horizontal sweep represents the voltage applied to the diode under test. The voltage
developed across current-measuring resistor R2 is applied to the vertical input of the oscilloscope.
Because this voltage is proportional to the current through the diode being tested, the vertical deflection
will indicate crystal current. The resulting oscilloscope trace for a normal diode is similar to the curve
shown in figure 2-16.
</p><p class="paragraph">To test Zener diodes, you must use a higher voltage than the oscilloscope line-test signal. This test
can be made with a diode test set or with the circuit shown in figure 2-17. In this circuit, rheostat R1 is
used to adjust the input voltage to a suitable value for the Zener diode being tested. Resistor R2 limits the
current through the diode. The signal voltage applied to the diode is also connected to the horizontal input
of the oscilloscope. The voltage developed across current-measuring resistor R3 is applied to the vertical
input of the oscilloscope. The horizontal sweep represents the applied voltage, and the vertical deflection
indicates the current through the diode being tested. Figure 2-18 shows the characteristic pattern of a
Zener diode. Note the sharp increase in current at the Zener voltage (avalanche) point. For the Zener
diode to be usable, this voltage must be within limits specified by the manufacturer.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Most transistorized equipments use printed circuit boards on which components are neatly arranged.
This arrangement makes the transistors and other components easy to reach while you are troubleshooting
and servicing the equipment. While investigating with test probes, however, you must be careful to
prevent damage to the printed wiring.
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the outstanding advantages of transistors is their reliability. Tube failures account for over 90
percent of the failures in electron-tube equipments. Transistors, however, are long lived. This factor,
among others, decreases maintenance required to keep transistorized equipment operating. The techniques
used in testing transistorized equipment are similar to those for maintaining electron-tube circuits.
Basically, these techniques include several checks and inspections.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Power Supply Checks
</h3><p class="paragraph">When using test equipment to localize a trouble, you should check the power supply to see that its
output voltages are present and of the correct values. Improper power supply voltages can cause odd

connections, making extensive voltage checks unnecessary.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Transistor Checks
</h3><p class="paragraph">Transistors can be checked by substitution. Transistors, however, have a characteristic known as
leakage current, which may affect the results obtained when the substitution method is used.
</p><p class="paragraph">The leakage current may influence the current gain or amplification factor of the transistor.
Therefore, a particular transistor might operate properly in one circuit and not in another. This
characteristic is more critical in certain applications than in others. As the transistor ages, the amount of
leakage current tends to increase. One type of transistor checker used is the semiconductor test set. This
test set can be used either for in-circuit or out-of-circuit tests or for collector leakage current or current
gain. You should use extreme care when substituting transistors. More and more transistors have specific
current and breakdown voltage requirements that may affect how they operate within a given circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-12. As a transistor ages, what happens to the leakage current?
Voltage Checks
</p><p class="paragraph">Voltage measurements provide a means of checking circuit conditions in a transistorized circuit just
as they do in checking conditions in a tube circuit. The voltages, however, are much lower than in a tube
circuit. The bias voltage between the base and emitter, for instance, is usually 0.05 to 0.20 volts. When
making checks, observe polarity.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Resistance Checks
</h3><p class="paragraph">Transistors have little tendency to burn or change value because of low voltage in their circuits. They
can, however, be permanently damaged by high-voltage conditions that occur when the collector voltage
is increased. They can also be permanently damaged when the ambient temperature increases and causes
excessive collector current flow. Transistors are easily damaged by high current; therefore, resistance
measurements must not be taken with an ohmmeter that provides a maximum current output in excess of
1 milliampere. If you are not sure that the range of ohmmeter you want to use is below the 1 milliampere
level, connect the ohmmeter to a milliammeter and check it. See figure 2-19 for a method of measuring
the current from an ohmmeter.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Three basic tachometers are used for measuring mechanical rotation frequency—the CENTRIFUGAL
tachometer, the CHRONOMETRIC tachometer, and the STROBOSCOPIC tachometer.
</p><p class="paragraph">ELECTRICAL-OUTPUT frequencies of ac generators can be measured by VIBRATING-REED
devices or TUNED CIRCUITS.
</p><p class="paragraph">AUDIO FREQUENCIES can be measured by a process known as ZERO BEATING. This is done
by matching an unknown signal with a locally generated signal of the same frequency obtained from a
calibrated high-precision oscillator. As the two frequencies are brought closer to the same value, they
reach a point of zero beat. This is when the frequency generated in the oscillator is equal to the frequency

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-METER-POWER-SOURCE-3-2-">METER POWER SOURCE
</h2><p class="paragraph">Meters are either SELF-EXCITED or EXTERNALLY EXCITED. Self-excited meters operate from
their own power sources. Externally excited meters get their power from the circuit to which they are
connected. Most common meters (voltmeters, ammeters, and ohmmeters) that you use in your work
operate on the electromagnetic principle. All measuring instruments must have some form of indicating
device, usually a meter, to be of any use to you. The most basic indicating device used in instruments that
measure current and voltage operates by using the interaction between the magnetic fields associated with
current flow in the circuit. Before continuing, you might want to review the properties of magnetism and
electromagnetism in NEETS, Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-1. What meters operate from their own power sources?
BASIC METER MOVEMENT
</p><p class="paragraph">A stationary, permanent-magnet, moving-coil meter is the basic meter movement used in most
measuring instruments used for servicing electrical equipment. When current flows through the coil, a
resulting magnetic field reacts with the magnetic field of the permanent magnet and causes the movable
coil to rotate. The greater the intensity of current flow through the coil, the stronger the magnetic field
produced; the stronger the magnetic field produced, the greater the rotation of the coil. The
GALVANOMETER is an example of one type of stationary, permanent-magnet, moving-coil measuring
instrument.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Galvanometer
</h3><p class="paragraph">The galvanometer is used to measure very low currents, such as those in bridge circuits. In modified
form, the galvanometer has the highest sensitivity of any of the various types of meters in use today. A
simplified diagram of a galvanometer is shown in figure 3-1. It is different from other instruments used
for the same purpose because its movable coil is suspended by means of metal ribbons instead of a shaft
and jewel-bearing arrangement often used in other instruments.
</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The movable coil is wrapped around the aluminum frame of the galvanometer. The coil is suspended
between the poles of the magnet by means of thin, flat ribbons of phosphor bronze. These ribbons provide
a conduction path for the current between the circuit being tested and the movable coil. The ribbons allow
the coil to twist in response to the interaction of the applied current through the coil and the magnetic
field of the permanent magnet. They also provide the restoring force for the coil. Basically, the restoring
force is that force necessary to return the movable frame to its resting position after a reading. The
ribbons restrain or provide a counterforce to the magnetic force acting on the coil. When the driving force
of the coil current is removed, the restoring force provided by the ribbons returns the coil to its zero
position.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-2. What physical component of a galvanometer provides the restoring force for the coil?
To determine the amount of current flow, we must have a means to indicate the amount of coil
</p><p class="paragraph">rotation. Either of two methods may be used: (1) the POINTER arrangement or (2) the LIGHT AND
MIRROR arrangement.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-3. In a galvanometer, what two methods are used to indicate the amount of coil rotation?
In the pointer arrangement, one end of the pointer is mechanically connected to the rotating coil; as
</p><p class="paragraph">the coil moves, the pointer also moves. The other end of the pointer moves across a graduated scale and
indicates the amount of current flow. The overall simplicity of this arrangement is its main advantage.
However, a disadvantage of this arrangement is that it introduces a mechanical coil balancing problem,
especially if the pointer is long.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-4. What is the primary disadvantage of the pointer arrangement for indicating coil rotation?
In the light and mirror arrangement, the use of a mirror and a beam of light simplifies the problem of
</p><p class="paragraph">coil balance. When this arrangement is used to measure the turning of the coil, a small mirror is mounted
on the supporting ribbon, as shown in figure 3-1. An internal light source is directed to the mirror and
then reflected to the scale of the meter. As the movable coil turns, so does the mirror. This causes the light
reflection to move across the graduated scale of the meter. The movement of the reflection is proportional
to the movement of the coil; therefore, the intensity of the current being measured by the meter is
accurately indicated.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the beam of light and mirror arrangement is used, the beam of light is swept to the right or left
across a translucent screen (scale). The translucent screen is divided uniformly with the zero reading
located at center scale. If the pointer arrangement is used, the pointer is moved in a horizontal plane to the
right or left across a scale that is divided uniformly with the zero reading at the center. The direction in
which the beam of light or the pointer moves depends on the direction (polarity) of current through the
coil.
</p><h3 class="subsection">D’Arsonval Meter Movement
</h3><p class="paragraph">Most dc instruments use meters based on some form of the D’Arsonval meter movement. In
D’Arsonval-type meters, the length of the conductor and the strength of the field between the poles of the
magnet are fixed. Therefore, any change in current causes a proportional change in the force acting on the
coil. Figure 3-2 is a simplified diagram showing the principle of the D’Arsonval movement.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">3-4
</p><p class="paragraph">In the figure, only one turn of wire is shown; however, in an actual meter movement, many turns of
fine wire would be used, each turn adding more effective length to the coil. The coil is wound on an
aluminum frame (bobbin) to which the pointer is attached. Oppositely wound hairsprings (only one is
shown in the figure) are also attached to the bobbin, one at either end. The circuit to the coil is completed
through the hairsprings. In addition to serving as conductors, the hairsprings serve as the restoring force
that returns the pointer to the zero position when no current flows.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-5. What component of the D’Arsonval meter movement completes the circuit for current flow to the
coil?
</p><p class="paragraph">COIL MOVEMENT.—As we discussed previously, the deflecting (moving) force on the coil is
proportional to the current flowing through the coil. This deflecting force tends to cause the coil to rotate
against the restraining force of the hairsprings. When the deflecting force and the restraining force are
equal, the coil and the pointer stop moving. As we have just stated, the deflecting force is proportional to
the current in the coil, the angle (amount) of rotation is proportional to the deflecting force; therefore, the
angle of rotation is proportional to the current through the coil. When current stops flowing through the
coil, the deflecting force stops, and the restoring force of the springs returns the pointer to the zero
position.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-6. What component supplies restoring force to the coil of the D’Arsonval meter movement?
DIRECTION OF FORCE.—The current through the single turn of wire is in the direction
</p><p class="paragraph">indicated in the figure (away from you on the right-hand side and toward you on the left-hand side). If we
apply the right-hand motor rule, the direction of force is upward on the left-hand side and downward on
the right-hand side; therefore, the direction of motion of the coil and pointer is clockwise. If the current
were reversed in the wire, the direction of motion of the coil and pointer would be reversed. For a review
of the right-hand rule for motors, refer to NEETS, Module 5, Introduction to Generators and Motors.
</p><p class="paragraph">PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION.—A more detailed view of the basic D'Arsonval movement, as it is
used in ammeters and voltmeters, is shown in figure 3-3. The principle of operation is the same as that
discussed in the simplified version. The iron core is rigidly supported between the pole pieces; it serves to</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">concentrate the flux in the narrow space between the iron core and the pole piece. Current flows into one
hairspring, through the coil, and out the other hairspring. The restoring forces of the spiral springs return
the pointer to the normal zero position when the current through the coil is interrupted. Conductors
connect the hairsprings with the outside terminals of the meter. If the instrument is not DAMPED to
absorb the energy of the moving element, the pointer will oscillate (vibrate) for a period of time before
coming to a stop in its final position. Damping is an energy-absorbing system that prevents this.
</p><p class="paragraph">DAMPING.—This is accomplished in many D'Arsonval movements by means of the motion of the
aluminum bobbin on which the coil is wound. As the bobbin rotates in the magnetic field, an
electromotive force is induced into it as it cuts through the lines of force. Induced currents flow in the
bobbin in a direction opposite to the motion; this causes the bobbin to go beyond its final position only
once before stopping. The overall sensitivity of the meter can be increased by the use of a lightweight
rotating assembly (bobbin, coil, and pointer) and by the use of jewel bearings, as shown in figure 3-3.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">POLE CONSTRUCTION.—Note that the pole pieces in figures 3-2 and 3-3 have curved faces.
You can see the advantage of this type of construction if you remember that lines of force enter and leave
a magnetic field in the air gap at right angles to the coil, regardless of the angular position of the coil.
Because of this type of construction, a more linear scale is possible than if the pole faces were flat.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-7. What advantage is gained by using pole pieces with curved faces in the D’Arsonval meter
movement?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DC-AMMETER-3-6-">DC AMMETER
</h2><p class="paragraph">The movable coil of the D'Arsonval meter movement we have been discussing up to now uses small-
size wire in its windings. This small-size wire places limits on the amount of current that can be safely
passed through the coil. Therefore, the basic D'Arsonval movement discussed can be used to indicate or
measure only very small currents. Certain circuit changes must be made to the basic D'Arsonval meter
movement for it to be practical in everyday use. To measure large currents, you must use a SHUNT with
the meter.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Shunts
</h3><p class="paragraph">A shunt is a physically large, low-resistance conductor connected in parallel (shunt) with the meter
terminals. It is used to carry the majority of the load current. Such a shunt is designed with the correct
amount of resistance so that only a small portion of the total current flows through the meter coil. The
meter current is proportional to the total load current. If the shunt is of such a value that the meter is
calibrated in milliamperes, the instrument is called a MILLIAMMETER. If the shunt has such a value that
the meter must be calibrated in terms of amperes, it is called an AMMETER.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-8. What structurally large, low-resistance conductor is connected in parallel with the meter
movement to prevent damage?
</p><p class="paragraph">SHUNT RESISTANCE.—A single, standardized meter movement is normally used in all
ammeters, no matter what the range is for a particular meter. For example, meters with working ranges of
0 to 10 amperes, 0 to 5 amperes, or 0 to 1 ampere all use the same meter movement. The various ranges
are achieved through the use of different values of shunt resistance with the same meter movement. The
designer of the ammeter simply calculates the correct shunt resistance required to extend the range of the
meter movement to measure any desired value of current. This shunt is then connected across the meter
terminals. Shunts may be located inside the meter case (internal shunts) with the proper switching
arrangements for changing them. They may also be located outside the meter case (external shunts) with
the necessary leads to connect them to the meter.
</p><p class="paragraph">EXTERNAL SHUNTS.—An external-shunt circuit is shown in figure 3-4, view A. Typical external
shunts are shown in view B. View C shows a meter movement mounted within the case. The case
provides protection against breakage, magnetic shielding in some cases, and portability.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">3-7
</p><p class="paragraph">SHUNT CONSTRUCTION.—The shunt strips (view B of figure 3-4) are usually made of the alloy
Manganin. Manganin has a temperature coefficient of almost zero. The zero-temperature coefficient
property is desirable because of the heavy currents that often flow through shunts producing heat. A zero-
temperature coefficient material is not affected by this heat; therefore, it remains stable in temperature.
Most other materials increase their resistance as they are heated. If shunts were made of these materials,
they would carry less current. More and more current would flow through the meter movement, and the
chances of damage would increase. Using shunts constructed with zero-temperature coefficient materials
eliminates this problem.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-9. What type of temperature coefficient material does not produce increased heat in response to
increased current flow?
</p><p class="paragraph">The ends of the shunt strips are embedded in heavy copper blocks. The blocks are attached to the
meter coil leads and the line terminals. To ensure accurate readings, you should not interchangeably use
the meter leads for a particular ammeter with those for a meter of a different range. Slight changes in lead
length and size may vary the resistance of the meter circuit. If this happens, current will also change and
cause incorrect meter readings. External shunts are generally used where currents greater than 50 amperes
must be measured.
</p><p class="paragraph">SHUNT SELECTION.—When using an external-shunt ammeter, you should select a suitable shunt
so that the scale deflection can be easily read. For example, if the scale has 150 divisions and the load
current you want to measure is known to be between 50 and 100 amperes, a 150-ampere shunt would be
the correct choice. Under these conditions, each division of the scale represents 1 ampere. In other words,</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">a full-scale deflection of the pointer would rest on the 150th division mark, indicating that 150 amperes of
load current is flowing. At half-scale deflection, the pointer would rest on the 75th division mark,
indicating that 75 amperes of load current is flowing.
</p><p class="paragraph">A shunt having exactly the same current rating as the expected normal load current should never be
selected. If you were to select such a shunt, higher than normal load currents could possibly drive the
pointer off scale and damage the meter movement. A good choice of shunt values will place the indicating
needle somewhere near the midscale indication when the load current you are reading is normal. For
example, assume that the meter scale is divided into 100 equal divisions and you want to measure a
current of 60 amperes. The shunt to use would be a 100-ampere shunt. This would make each division of
the scale equal to 1 ampere. The meter indication would fall on the 60th division showing that 60 amperes
of load current is flowing. Therefore, an allowance (40 amperes) remains for unexpected surge currents.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-10. A good choice of shunt resistance will place the indicating pointer near what part of the meter
scale with a normal load?
</p><p class="paragraph">INTERNAL SHUNTS FOR METERS IN THE 0- TO 50-AMPERE RANGE.—When
measuring current ranges below 50 amperes, you will most often use internal shunts (Rshunt). In this way,
you can easily change the range of the meter by means of a switching arrangement. A switch will select
the correct internal shunt with the necessary current rating and resistance. Before you can calculate the
required resistance of the shunt for each range, the total resistance of the meter movement must be
known. For example, suppose you desire to use a 100-microampere D'Arsonval meter with an internal
coil resistance of 100 ohms to measure line currents up to 1 ampere. The meter will deflect to its full-scale
position when the current through the deflection coil is 100 microamperes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the coil resistance is 100 ohms, you can calculate the coil's voltage (Ecoil) by using Ohm's law,
as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">When the pointer is deflected to full scale, 100 microamperes of current flows through the coil and
0.01 volt drops across it. Remember, 100 microamperes is the maximum safe current for this meter
movement. Exceeding this value will damage the meter. The shunt must carry any additional load current.
</p><p class="paragraph">The meter coil has a 0.01 volt drop across it, and, because the shunt and coil are in parallel, the shunt
also has a voltage drop of 0.01 volt. The current that flows through the shunt is the difference between the
full-scale meter current and the line current being fed into the shunt. In this case, meter current is 100
microamperes. Full-scale deflection is desired only when the total current is 1 ampere. Therefore, the
shunt current must equal 1 ampere minus 100 microamperes, or 0.9999 ampere. Ohm's law is again used
to provide the approximate value of required shunt resistance (Rshunt), as follows:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">To increase the range of the 100-microampere meter to 1 ampere (full-scale deflection), place a 0.01-
ohm shunt in parallel with the meter movement.
</p><p class="paragraph">You can convert the 100-microampere instrument to a 10-ampere meter by using a proper shunt. The
voltage drop for a full-scale deflection is still 0.01 volt across the coil and the shunt. The meter current is
still 100 microamperes. The shunt current must therefore be 9.9999 amperes under full-scale deflection.
Again, this is an approximate figure found by the application of Ohm’s law.
</p><p class="paragraph">You can also convert the same instrument to a 50-ampere meter by using the proper shunt resistance,
as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">INTERNAL SHUNTS FOR METERS IN THE MILLIAMPERE RANGE.—The above method
of computing the shunt resistance is satisfactory in most cases; however, it can only be used when the line
current is in the ampere range and the meter current is relatively small compared to the load current. In
such cases, you can use an approximate value of resistance for the shunt, as was done above. However,
when the line current is in the milliampere range and the coil current becomes an appreciable percentage
of the line current, a more accurate calculation must be made. For example, suppose you desire to use a
meter movement that has a full-scale deflection of 1 milliampere and a coil resistance of 50 ohms to
measure currents up to 10 milliamperes. Using Ohm's law, you can figure the voltage (Ecoil) across the
meter coil (and the shunt) at full-scale deflection, as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">The current that flows through the shunt (Ishunt) is the difference between the line current and the
meter current, as figured below:
</p><p class="paragraph">The shunt resistance (Rshunt) may then be figured, as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that, in this case, the exact value of shunt resistance has been used rather than an
approximation.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The formula for determining the resistance of the shunt is given by Rs = Im /Is times Rm, where Rs is
the shunt resistance in ohms; Im is the meter current at full-scale deflection; Is is the shunt current at full-
scale deflection; and Rm  is the resistance of the meter coil. If the values given in the previous example are
used in this equation, it will yield 5.55 ohms, the value previously calculated.
</p><p class="paragraph">SWITCHING SHUNT VALUES.—Various values of shunt resistance can be used, by means of a
suitable switching arrangement, to increase the number of current ranges that can be covered by the
meter. Two switching arrangements are shown in figure 3-5. View A is the simpler of the two
arrangements when a number of shunts are used to calculate the values of the shunt resistors. However, it
has two disadvantages:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. When the switch is moved from one shunt resistor to another, the shunt is momentarily removed
from the meter. The line current then flows through the meter coil. Even a momentary surge of
current could easily damage the coil.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The contact resistance (resistance between the blades of the switch when they are in contact) is in
series with the shunt, but not with the meter coil. In shunts that must pass high currents, this
contact resistance becomes an appreciable part of the total shunt resistance. Because the contact
resistance is of a variable nature, the ammeter indication may not be accurate.
</p><p class="paragraph">The generally preferred method of range switching is shown in (figure 3-5, view B). Although only
two ranges are shown, as many ranges as needed can be used. In this type of circuit, the contact resistance
of the range-selector switch is external to the shunt and meter in each range position. The contact
resistance in this case has no effect on the accuracy of the current measurement.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Ammeter Connections
</h3><p class="paragraph">When you are using ammeters, a primary rule of safety is that such current-measuring instruments
must always be connected in series with a circuit, never in parallel with it. When an ammeter is
connected across a constant-potential source of appreciable voltage, the low internal resistance of the
meter bypasses the circuit resistance. This results in the application of the source voltage (or a good</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

renders the meter useless until repaired.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-11. In what manner are current-measuring instruments connected to a circuit?
If you do not know the approximate value of current in the circuit, you should take a reading at the
</p><p class="paragraph">highest range of the ammeter; then you should switch progressively to lower ranges until a suitable
reading is obtained. Most ammeter scales indicate the current being measured in increasing values from
left to right. If you connect the meter without observing proper polarity, the pointer may be deflected
backwards (from right to left). This action often damages the meter movement. You should ensure that
the ammeter is always connected so that the current will flow into the negative terminal and out the
positive terminal. Figure 3-6 shows various circuit arrangements and the proper ammeter connection
methods to measure current in various portions of the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-12. An ammeter should always be connected so that current will flow into what terminal and out of
what terminal?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Ammeter Sensitivity
</h3><p class="paragraph">Ammeter sensitivity is determined by the amount of current required by the meter coil to produce
full-scale deflection of the pointer. The smaller the amount of current required to produce this deflection,
the greater the sensitivity of the meter. A meter movement that requires only 100 microamperes for full-
scale deflection has a greater sensitivity than a meter movement that requires 1 milliampere for the same
deflection.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-13. (True or False) The larger the current required to produce full-scale deflection of the meter coil,
the better the sensitivity of the meter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Good sensitivity is especially important in ammeters to be used in circuits in which small currents
flow. As the meter is connected in series with the load, the current flows through the meter. If the internal
resistance of the meter is a large portion of the load resistance, an effect known as METER-LOADING
will occur. Meter-loading is the condition that exists when the insertion of a meter into a circuit changes
the operation of that circuit. This condition is not desirable. The purpose of inserting a meter into a circuit

example of this is shown in figure 3-7.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-14. What condition exists when the insertion of a meter into a circuit changes the operation of the
circuit?
</p><p class="paragraph">In view A of figure 3-7, the circuit to be tested has an applied voltage of 100 millivolts and a
resistance of 100 ohms. The current normally flowing in this circuit is 1 milliampere. In view B, an
ammeter that requires 1 milliampere for full-scale deflection and that has an internal resistance of 100
ohms has been inserted. Since 1 milliampere of current flow is shown in view A, you might naturally
assume that with the meter inserted into the circuit, a full-scale deflection will occur. You might also
assume that the 1 milliampere of circuit current will be measured. However, neither of these assumptions
is correct. With the ammeter inserted into the circuit, as shown in view B, the total resistance of the circuit
is 200 ohms. With an applied voltage of 100 millivolts, applying Ohm’s law shows the actual current
(Icircuit) to be 0.5 milliampere.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the meter reads 0.5 milliampere instead of the normal value of current, the meter reveals that a
definite loading effect has taken place. In cases such as this, the use of ammeters, which have a lower
internal resistance and a better current sensitivity, is desirable.

diagram of a voltmeter is shown in figure 3-8.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-15. What modification is made to the D’Arsonval meter movement to enable the meter to measure
voltage?
</p><p class="paragraph">Keep in mind that the D’Arsonval meter movement uses current flow to produce a magnetic field that
is proportional to the current. The meter movement is, therefore, an indicator of current flow rather than
voltage. The addition of the series resistance is what allows the meter to be calibrated in terms of voltage;
that is, the meter movement of a voltmeter operates because of the current flow through the meter, but the
scale is marked in volts. For example, the meter movement shown in figure 3-9 has an internal resistance
of 100 ohms, requires 100 microamperes for full-scale deflection, and has a voltage drop of 10 millivolts
when full-scale deflection is reached. If you were to place this meter directly across a 10-volt source, an
excessive current (in milliamperes) would flow. The meter would be destroyed because of the excessive
current flowing through the meter movement. This can be seen in the following Ohm’s law application:
</p><p class="paragraph">Using this equation, you can see that a current through the meter of 100 milliamperes is excessive
and will cause damage.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Since the normal voltage drop for the meter is 10 millivolts at full-scale deflection, some means must
be supplied to drop the extra 9.99 volts without applying it directly to the meter. This is done by the
addition of a multiplier resistor, as shown in figure 3-9.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Extending Voltmeter Ranges
</h3><p class="paragraph">The value of series resistance is determined by the current required for full-scale deflection and by
the range of the voltages to be measured. Since the current through the meter circuit is directly
proportional to the applied voltage, the meter scale can be calibrated directly in volts for a fixed value of
series resistance. For example, let’s assume that the basic meter is to be made into a voltmeter with a full-
scale deflection of 1 volt. The coil resistance of the basic meter is 100 ohms, and 100 microamperes of
current causes full-scale deflection. The resistance (R
</p><p class="paragraph"> meter) required to limit the total current in the circuit
to 100 microamperes can be found as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">Because the meter coil already measures 100 ohms, the series resistance required is equal to 10
kilohms minus 100 ohms, or 9.9 kilohms.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-16. What factors determine the value of the multiplier resistor?
Multirange voltmeters use one meter movement. The required resistances are connected in series

</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-17. In what manner are voltage-measuring instruments connected to the circuit to be measured?
Influence of a Voltmeter in a Circuit
</p><p class="paragraph">The purpose of a voltmeter is to indicate the potential difference between two points in a circuit.
When a voltmeter is connected across a circuit, it shunts the circuit. If the voltmeter has a low resistance,
it will draw a substantial amount of current. This action lowers the effective resistance of the circuit and
changes the voltage reading. When you are making voltage measurements in high-resistance circuits, use
a HIGH-RESISTANCE VOLTMETER to prevent the shunting action of the voltmeter. The effect is less
noticeable in low-resistance circuits because the shunting effect is less. The problem of voltmeter
shunting (sometimes called circuit loading) is illustrated in figure 3-11.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-18. When making voltage measurements in a high-resistance circuit, you should always use a
voltmeter with what relative value of resistance?
</p><p class="paragraph">In view A of figure 3-11, a source of 150 volts is applied to a series circuit consisting of two 10-
kilohm resistors. View A shows the voltage drop across each resistor to be 75 volts. In the 150-volt range,
the voltmeter to be used has a total internal resistance of 10 kilohms. View B shows the voltmeter
connected across the circuit. The parallel combination of R2 and the meter now present a total resistance
of 5 kilohms. Because of the addition of the voltmeter, the voltage drops change to 100 volts across R1
and 50 volts across R2. Notice that this is not the normal voltage drop across R2. Actual circuit conditions
have been altered because of the voltmeter.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Voltmeter Sensitivity
</h3><p class="paragraph">The sensitivity of a voltmeter is given in ohms per volt. It is determined by dividing the sum of the
resistance of the meter (Rmeter), plus the series resistance (Rseries), by the full-scale reading in volts. In
equation form, sensitivity is expressed as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">This is the same as saying the sensitivity is equal to the reciprocal of the full-scale deflection current.
In equation form, this is expressed as follows:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

METERS USED FOR MEASURING RESISTANCE
</p><p class="paragraph">The two instruments you will use most often to check continuity, or to measure the resistance of a
circuit or circuit component, are the OHMMETER and the MEGGER (MEGOHMMETER). The
ohmmeter is widely used to measure resistance and to check the continuity of electrical circuits and
devices. Its range usually extends to only a few megohms. The megger is widely used for measuring
insulation resistance, such as that between a wire and the outer surface of its insulation, and the insulation
resistance of cables and insulators. The range of a megger can be extended to more than 1,000 megohms.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-20. What instrument is used for measuring the insulation resistance of cables?
The Ohmmeter
</p><p class="paragraph">A simple ohmmeter circuit is shown in figure 3-12. The ohmmeter consists of the dc milliammeter,
discussed earlier in this chapter, and the added features shown below:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">• A source of dc potential; and
</h3><p class="paragraph">• One or more resistors (one of which is variable).
 Q-21. What added features enable a dc milliammeter to function as an ohmmeter?
</p><p class="paragraph">The deflection of the pointer of an ohmmeter is controlled by the amount of battery current passing
through the moving coil. Before you can measure the resistance of an unknown resistor or electrical
circuit, you must calibrate the ohmmeter to be used. If the value of resistance to be measured can be
estimated within reasonable limits, select a range on the ohmmeter that will give approximately half-scale
deflection when the resistance is inserted between the probes. If you cannot estimate the resistance to be
measured, then set the range switch on the highest scale. Whatever range you select, the meter must be
calibrated to read zero before the unknown resistance is measured.
</p><p class="paragraph">To calibrate the meter, you first short the test leads together, as shown in figure 3-12. With the test
leads shorted, a complete series circuit exists. The complete series circuit consists of the 3-volt source, the
resistance of the meter coil (R
</p><p class="paragraph"> meter), the resistance of the zero-adjust rheostat, and the series multiplying
resistor (Rseries). The shorted test leads cause current to flow and the meter pointer to deflect.
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that the zero point on the ohmmeter scale (as opposed to the zero points for voltage and
current) is located at the extreme right side of the scale. With the test leads shorted, the zero-adjust
potentiometer is set so that the pointer rests on the zero mark. Therefore, a full-scale deflection indicates
zero resistance between the leads.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-22. A full-scale deflection on an ohmmeter scale indicates what resistance between the leads?
If you change the range on the meter, you must "zero" (calibrate) the meter again to obtain an
</p><p class="paragraph">accurate reading. When you separate the test leads, the pointer of the meter will return to the left side of
the scale. This action, as explained earlier, is caused by the restoring force of the spring tension acting on
the movable coil assembly. The reading at the left side of the scale indicates an infinite resistance.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">3-19
</p><p class="paragraph">After you have adjusted the ohmmeter for zero reading, it is ready to be connected to a circuit to
measure resistance. A typical circuit and ohmmeter arrangement is shown in figure 3-13. You must
ensure that the power switch of the circuit to be measured is in the de-energized (OFF) position. This
prevents the source voltage of the circuit from being applied to the meter, a condition that could cause
severe damage to the meter movement.
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember that the ohmmeter is an open circuit when the test leads are separated. To take a
resistance reading with a meter, you must provide a path for current flow produced by the meter’s battery.
In view A of figure 3-13, the meter is connected at points A and B to produce this path. Connecting these
test leads places resistors R1 and R2 in series with the resistance of the meter coil, the zero-adjust
potentiometer, and the series multiplying resistor. Since you previously calibrated the meter, the amount
of coil movement now depends only on the resistances of R1 and R2.
</p><p class="paragraph">The addition of R1 and R2 into the meter circuit raises the total series resistance and decreases the
current. This decreases the amount of pointer deflection. The pointer comes to rest at a scale reading that
indicates the combined resistance of R1 and R2. If you were to replace either R1 or R2, or both, with a
resistor having a larger ohmic value, the current flow in the moving coil of the meter would be decreased
even more. This would further decrease the pointer deflection, and the scale indication would read a still
higher circuit resistance. View B is a simplified version of the circuitry in view A.
</p><p class="paragraph">From our ohmmeter discussion, two facts should be apparent: (1) Movement of the moving coil is
proportional to the amount of current flow, and (2) the scale reading of the ohmmeter is inversely
proportional to current flow in the moving coil.
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of circuit resistance to be measured may vary over a wide range. In some cases, it may
only be a few ohms; in other cases, it may be as great as 1 megohm. Scale multiplication features are built
into most ohmmeters so that they will indicate any ohmic value being measured and offer the least
amount of error. Most ohmmeters are equipped with a selector switch for selecting the multiplication
scale desired. For example, view A of figure 3-14 shows a typical meter that has a six-position switch.
The positions are marked on the meter in multiples of 10, from R ·  1 through R ·  100K.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The range used to measure any particular unknown resistance (Rx in view A of figure 3-14) depends
on the approximate ohmic value of the unknown resistance. For instance, the ohmmeter scale of the figure
is calibrated in divisions from 0 to infinity. Note that the divisions are easier to read on the right-hand
portion of the scale than on the left. For this reason, if Rx is greater than 1,000 ohms and if you are using
the R ·  1 range, you will be unable to accurately read the indicated resistance. This happens because the
combined series resistance of resistors Rx is too large for range R ·  1 to allow enough battery current to
flow to deflect the pointer away from infinity. You need to turn the range switch to the R ·  10 position to
obtain the 1,000-ohm reading.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s assume that you have changed the range switch to the R ·  10 position and the pointer now
deflects to a reading of 375 ohms, as shown in view B of figure 3-14. This would indicate to you that
unknown resistance Rx has 3,750 (375 times 10) ohms of resistance. The change of range caused the
deflection because resistor R ·  10 has only 1/10 the resistance of resistor R ·  1. Therefore, selecting the
smaller series resistance allowed a battery current of sufficient value to cause a readable pointer
deflection. If the R ·  100 range were used to measure the same 3,750 ohm resistor, the pointer would
deflect still further to the 37.5-ohm position, as shown in view C. This increased deflection would occur
because resistor R ·  100 has only 1/10 the resistance of resistor R ·  10.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-23. The R ·  100 resistance selection on an ohmmeter has what amount of resistance compared to the
R ·  10 selection?
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit arrangement in view A of figure 3-14 allows the same amount of current to flow through
the moving meter coil. The same amount is allowed to flow whether the meter measures 10,000 ohms on
the R ·  1 scale, 100,000 ohms on the R ·  10 scale, or 1,000,000 ohms on the R ·  100 scale.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The same amount of current must always be used to deflect the pointer to a certain position on the
scale (midscale position, for example), regardless of the multiplication factor being used. Since the
multiplier resistors are of different values, you must always "zero" the meter for each multiplication scale
selected. When selecting a range on the ohmmeter, select the one that will result in the pointer coming to
rest as close to the midpoint of the scale as possible. This will enable you to read the resistance more
accurately because scale readings are more easily interpreted at or near midpoint.
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Megohmmeter
</h3><p class="paragraph">An ordinary ohmmeter cannot be used for measuring multimillion ohm values of resistances, such as
those in conductor insulation. To test for such insulation breakdown, you need to use a much higher
potential than that supplied by the battery of an ohmmeter. This potential is placed between the conductor
and the outside of the insulation. A megger (megohmmeter) is used for these tests. The megger, shown in
figure 3-15, is a portable instrument consisting of two main elements: (1) a hand-driven dc generator,
which supplies the necessary voltage for making the measurement, and (2) the instrument portion, which
indicates the value of the resistance you are measuring. The instrument portion is of the opposed-coil
type, as shown in view A. Coils a and b are mounted on movable member c. A fixed angular relationship
exists between coils, and they are free to turn as a unit in a magnetic field. Coil b tends to move the
pointer counterclockwise, and coil a tends to move it clockwise.
</p><p class="paragraph">Coil a is connected in series with R3 and unknown resistance Rx. The combination of coil a, R3, and
Rx forms a direct series path between the + and -  brushes of the dc generator. Coil b is connected in series

(pointer) of the instrument portion of the megger has no restoring springs. Therefore, when the generator
is not being operated, the pointer will float freely and may come to rest at any position on the scale.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The guard ring, shown in view A of figure 3-15, shunts any leakage currents to the negative side of
the generator. This prevents such current from flowing through coil a and affecting the meter reading.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-24. What is the purpose of the guard ring in a megohmmeter?
If the test leads are open, no current will flow in coil a. However, current will flow internally through
</p><p class="paragraph">coil b and deflect the pointer to infinity. This reading indicates a resistance too large to measure. When a
resistance, such as Rx, is connected between the test leads, current also flows in coil a; the pointer tends to
move clockwise. At the same time, coil b still tends to move the pointer counterclockwise. Therefore, the
moving element, composed of both coils and the pointer, comes to rest at a position in which the two
forces are balanced. This position depends upon the value of Rx, which controls the amount of the current
in coil a. Because changes in voltage affect both coils in the same proportion, the position of the moving
element is independent of the voltage. If you short the test leads together, the pointer will come to rest at
zero because the current in coil a is relatively large. Since R3 limits the current, the instrument will not be
damaged under these circumstances. The external appearance of one type of megger is shown in view B
of figure 3-15.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most meggers you will use are rated at 500 volts; however, there are other types. Meggers are
usually equipped with friction clutches, which are designed to slip if the generator is cranked faster than
its rated speed. This prevents the generator speed and output voltage from exceeding rated values. A
1,000-volt generator is available for extended ranges. When an extremely high resistance, such as 10,000
megohms or more, is to be measured, a high voltage is needed to cause enough current flow to actuate the
meter movement.

As shown in figure 3-16, the fixed coils are connected in series and positioned coaxially (in line)

series. The two pairs of coils (fixed pair and movable pair) are also connected in series with each other.
The movable coil is pivot-mounted between the fixed coils. The main shaft on which the movable coils
are mounted is restrained by spiral springs that restore the pointer to zero when no current is flowing
through the coil. These springs also act as conductors for delivering current to the movable coils. Since
these conducting springs are very small, the meter cannot carry a high value of current.

mechanically responding at this speed. The result is simply a vibration near the zero point; in addition, no
useful reading of voltage or current is obtained. This problem does not exist with the
electrodynamometer-type movement. Current flow through the stationary (fixed) coils sets up a magnetic
field. Current flow through the moving coils sets up an opposing magnetic field. With two magnetic fields
opposing, the pointer deflects to the right. If the current reverses direction, the magnetic fields of both sets
of coils will be reversed. With both fields reversed, the coils still oppose each other, and the pointer still
deflects to the right. Therefore, no rectifying devices are required to enable the electrodynamometer meter
movement to read both ac and dc. Rectifying devices are required for the D’Arsonval-type meter
movement to enable it to be used for measuring ac voltages and currents.

the spiral springs. When the electrodynamometer is used as a voltmeter, its internal connections and

This is because the large currents that flow through the meter cannot be carried through the moving coils.
In the ammeter in view B of figure 3-17, stationary coils a and b are wound of heavier wire to carry up to
5.0 amperes. An inductive shunt (XL) is wired in parallel with the moving coils and permits only a small
part of the total current to flow through the moving coil. The current flowing through the moving coil is
directly proportional to the total current flowing through the instrument. The shunt has the same ratio of
reactance to resistance as the moving coil does. Therefore, the instrument will be reasonably correct at
frequencies at which it is used if ac currents are to be measured.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WATTMETER-3-25-">WATTMETER
</h2><p class="paragraph">Electric power is measured by means of a wattmeter. This instrument is of the electrodynamometer
type. As shown in figure 3-18, it consists of a pair of fixed coils, known as current coils, and a moving
coil, called the voltage (potential) coil. The fixed current coils are wound with a few turns of a relatively
large conductor. The voltage coil is wound with many turns of fine wire. It is mounted on a shaft that is
supported in jeweled bearings so that it can turn inside the stationary coils. The movable coil carries a
needle (pointer) that moves over a suitably graduated scale. Coil springs hold the needle at the zero
position in the absence of a signal.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Wattmeter Connection
</h3><p class="paragraph">The current coil of the wattmeter is connected in series with the circuit (load), and the voltage coil is
connected across the line. When line current flows through the current coil of a wattmeter, a field is set up
around the coil. The strength of this field is in phase with and proportional to the line current. The voltage
coil of the wattmeter generally has a high-resistance resistor connected in series with it. The purpose for
this connection is to make the voltage-coil circuit of the meter as purely resistive as possible. As a result,
current in the voltage circuit is practically in phase with line voltage. Therefore, when voltage is</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">impressed on the voltage circuit, current is proportional to and in phase with the line voltage. Figure 3-19
shows the proper way to connect a wattmeter into a circuit.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Wattmeter Errors
</h3><p class="paragraph">Electrodynamic wattmeters are subject to errors arising from such factors as temperature and
frequency. For example, heat through the coils eventually causes the small springs attached to the pointer
to lengthen and lose tension, which produces deflection errors. Large currents through the wattmeter also
produce a noticeable deflection error. These errors are caused by the heat (I2R) loss through coils from the
application of high currents. Because of this, the maximum current range of electrodynamic wattmeters is
normally restricted to approximately 20 amperes. The voltage range of wattmeters is usually limited to
several hundred volts because of heat dissipation within the voltage circuit. However, the voltage range
can be extended by the use of voltage multipliers.
</p><p class="paragraph">Good-quality, portable wattmeters usually have an accuracy of 0.2 to 0.25 percent. You must
remember, though, that electrodynamic wattmeter errors increase with frequency. For the higher
frequency and power ranges, special types of wattmeters are made specifically for those ranges. We will
discuss two such wattmeters in chapter 5 of this module.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Wattmeter Overloads
</h3><p class="paragraph">The wattmeter consists of two circuits, either of which will be damaged if too much current passes
through them. You should be especially aware of this fact because the reading on the instrument will not
tell you whether or not the coils are being overheated. If an ammeter or voltmeter is overloaded, the
pointer will indicate beyond the upper limit of its scale. In the wattmeter, both the current and potential
circuit may carry such an overload that their insulations burn; yet the pointer may be only part of the way
up the scale. This is because the position of the pointer depends upon the power factor of the circuit as
well as upon the voltage and current. Therefore, a low power-factor circuit will provide a very low
reading on the wattmeter. The reading will be low, even when the current and voltage circuits are loaded
to the maximum safe limit. The safe rating for each wattmeter is always distinctly rated, not in watts, but
in volts and amperes.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

We have considered the more common meters; now let’s consider some of the techniques employed
</h3><p class="paragraph">in their use. The techniques suggested here are not all-inclusive. You will find, as you develop your
technical skills, other variations and techniques in use. Consider the techniques for measuring current in a
circuit. You can accomplish this by placing an ammeter in series with the circuit or by measuring the
voltage across a resistor of known value and using Ohm’s law to figure current. This last technique has the
advantage of eliminating the necessity of opening the circuit to connect the ammeter.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CONTINUITY-TESTS-3-27-">CONTINUITY TESTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Open circuits are those in which the flow of current is interrupted by a broken wire, defective switch,
or any means by which the current cannot flow. The test used to detect open circuits (or to see if the
circuit is complete or continuous) is continuity testing.
</p><p class="paragraph">An ohmmeter (which contains its own batteries) is excellent for use in a continuity test. Normally,
continuity tests are performed in circuits where the resistance is very low, such as the resistance of a
copper conductor. An open is indicated in these circuits by a very high or infinite resistance between two
continuously connected points.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-20 shows a continuity test of a cable that connects two electronic units. Notice that both
plugs are disconnected and the ohmmeter is in series with conductor D under test. The power should be
off. When checking conductors A, B, and C (connection of ohmmeter to conductors not shown), the
current from the ohmmeter flows through plug 2 (female) through conductor A, B, or C to plug 1
(female). From plug 1, current passes through the jumper to the chassis, which is "grounded" to the ship’s
structure. The metal structure serves as the return path to the chassis of unit 2 and completes the circuit
through the series-connected ohmmeter. The ohmmeter indicates a low resistance because no break exists
in conductors A, B, or C. However, checking conductor D reveals an open. The ohmmeter is shown
indicating maximum resistance because current cannot flow in an open circuit. With an open circuit, the
ohmmeter needle is all the way to the left since it is a series-type ohmmeter (reads right to left).

</p><p class="paragraph">Where conditions are such that the ship’s structure cannot be used as the return path, one of the other
conductors (known to be good) may be used. For example, to check D, you can connect a jumper from
pin D to pin A of plug 1 (female) and the ohmmeter leads to pins D and A of plug 2 (female). This
technique will also reveal the open in the circuit.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TESTING-FOR-GROUNDS-3-28-">TESTING FOR GROUNDS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Grounded circuits are caused by some conducting part of the circuit making contact either directly or
indirectly with the metallic structure of the ship. Grounds can have many causes. The two most common
are the fraying of insulation from a wire and moisture-soaked insulation. The fraying of insulation from a
wire allows bare wire to come into contact with the metal ground. Moisture-soaked insulation causes
reduced insulation resistance (also classified as a ground).
</p><p class="paragraph">Grounds are usually indicated by blown fuses or tripped circuit breakers. Blown fuses or tripped
circuit breakers, however, can also result from a short circuit other than a ground. A high-resistance
ground can also occur when current is increased significantly but not enough to rupture the fuse or trip the
circuit breaker.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUTION-3-28-">CAUTION
</h2><p class="paragraph">Before testing any circuit, ensure the circuit under test has been de-energized
and checked with a safety shorting probe.
</p><p class="paragraph">In testing for grounds, you may use a megger or an ohmmeter. Measuring the resistance to ground
from points in a circuit determines if the point is grounded. Referring again to figure 3-20, you can see
one possible means of testing a cable for grounds. If the jumper is removed from pin D of plug 1 (female),
a test for ground can be made for each conductor in the cable. You can do this by connecting one meter
lead to ground and the other to each of the pins of either of the plugs. A low resistance indicates that some
part of that conductor or one of the plug assemblies is grounded. Both plugs must be removed from their
units; if only one plug is removed, a false indication is possible because a conductor may be grounded
through the unit.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TESTING-FOR-SHORTS-3-28-">TESTING FOR SHORTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">A short circuit, other than a grounded one, is one where two conductors touch each other directly or
through another conducting element. Two conductors with frayed insulation may touch and cause a short.
Too much solder on the pin of a connector may short to the adjacent pin. In a short circuit, enough current
may or may not flow to blow a fuse or open a circuit breaker. A short may occur between two cables
carrying signals but might not be indicated by a blown fuse.
</p><p class="paragraph">Shorts occur in many components, such as transformers, motor windings, and capacitors. The major
test method used to detect shorts in such components is to measure resistance. The indicated resistance is
then compared with the resistance given on schematics or in the equipment technical manuals to
determine whether the measured value is within specifications.
</p><p class="paragraph">An ohmmeter is the device used to check for shorts. You can use the ohmmeter to detect a short
between two conductors by measuring the resistance between them (be sure electrical power has been
disconnected). A low resistance reading indicates a short. You can test the circuit in figure 3-20 for a
short by first removing the jumper and disconnecting both plugs; you then measure the resistance between
the two suspended conductors.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The following section discusses voltage measurements on live circuits. BE
SURE YOU ALWAYS FOLLOW PRESCRIBED SAFETY RULES WHEN
MEASURING VOLTAGES.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-VOLTAGE-TESTS-3-29-">VOLTAGE TESTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Voltage tests must be made with the power applied; therefore, the prescribed safety precautions must
be followed to prevent injury to personnel and damage to the equipment. You will find in your
maintenance work that the voltage test is of utmost importance. It is used not only in isolating casualties
to major components but also in the maintenance of subassemblies, units, and circuits. Before checking a
circuit voltage, you should check the voltage of the power source to be sure that the normal voltage is
being applied to the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltmeter is used for voltage tests. In using the voltmeter, make certain that the meter used is
designed for the type of current (ac or dc) to be tested and has a scale with a suitable range. Since
defective parts in a circuit can cause higher than normal voltages to be present at the point of test, the
highest voltmeter range available should be used first. Once you have obtained a reading, determine if a
lower scale can be used that will cause no damage to the meter movement. If so, use the lower scale. This
provides a more accurate reading.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another consideration in the circuit voltage test is the resistance and current in the circuit. A low
resistance in a high-current circuit could result in considerable voltage drop, whereas the same resistance
in a low-current circuit may be minimal. Abnormal resistance in part of a circuit can be checked with
either an ohmmeter or a voltmeter. Where practical, an ohmmeter should be used because the test is then
carried out with a "dead" circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">The majority of the electronic circuits you will encounter in equipment will be low-current circuits,
and most voltage readings will be direct current. Also, many of the schematics will indicate the voltages
at various test points. Therefore, if you suspect that a certain stage is defective, you can check the voltage
by connecting a voltmeter from the test point to ground. If the suspected stage is not defective, the
voltmeter readings should match the voltages given on the schematic.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some technical manuals also contain voltage charts on which all the voltage measurements are
tabulated. These charts usually indicate the sensitivity of the meter (for example, 20,000 ohms/volt) used
to obtain the voltage readings for the chart. To obtain comparable results, you must use a voltmeter of the
same sensitivity (or greater) as that specified. Make certain that the voltmeter is not "loading" the circuit
while taking a measurement. If the meter resistance is not considerably higher than the circuit resistance,
the reading will be markedly lower than the true circuit voltage because of the voltmeter’s loading effect.
(To calculate meter resistance, multiply the rated ohms-per-volt sensitivity value of the meter by the scale
in use. For example, a 1,000-ohms-per-volt meter set to the 300-volt scale will have a resistance of
300,000 ohms.)
RESISTANCE TESTS
</p><p class="paragraph">Before checking the resistance of a circuit or of a part, make certain that the power has been turned
off. Also make sure capacitors in the associated circuit are fully discharged. To check continuity, always
use the lowest ohmmeter range. If the highest range is used, the meter may indicate zero, even though
appreciable resistance is present in the circuit. Conversely, to check a high resistance, use the highest
scale since the lower range scale may indicate infinity, even though the resistance is less than a megohm.
In making resistance tests, you must remember that even though the external ohmmeter leads are</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">connected in parallel with the circuit to be measured, the internal meter circuitry is electrically connected
in series.
</p><p class="paragraph">In making resistance tests, take into account that other circuits containing resistances and
capacitances may be in parallel with the circuit to be measured. Erroneous conclusions may be drawn
from readings obtained in such cases. Remember, a capacitor blocks the dc flow from the ohmmeter. To
obtain an accurate reading when other parts are connected across the suspected circuit, disconnect one end
of the circuit to be measured from the equipment. For example, many of the resistors in major
components and subassemblies are connected across transformer windings. To obtain a valid resistance
measurement, you must isolate the resistors to be measured from the shunt resistances of the coils of the
transformers.
</p><p class="paragraph">Resistance tests are also used to check a component for grounds. In these tests, the component to be
tested should be disconnected from the rest of the circuit so that no normal circuit ground will exist.
Dismounting the component to be checked is not necessary. The ohmmeter is set for a high-resistance
range. Then the ohmmeter is connected between ground and each electrically separate circuit of the
component being tested. Any resistance reading less than infinity indicates at least a partial ground. You
can also check capacitors suspected of being short-circuited by measuring the resistance. To check a
capacitor suspected of being open, temporarily shunt a known good capacitor then recheck the
performance of the circuit.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUTION-3-30-">CAUTION

instruments to perform required maintenance and upkeep of electronic systems and components. You
were also introduced to the construction and operation of basic meter movements in test equipment. This
chapter will introduce you to some of the testing instruments commonly used in the Navy today.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MULTIMETERS-4-1-">MULTIMETERS
</h2><p class="paragraph">During troubleshooting, you will often be required to measure voltage, current, and resistance.
Rather than using three or more separate meters for these measurements, you can use the
MULTIMETER. The multimeter contains circuitry that allows it to be used as a voltmeter, an ammeter,
or an ohmmeter. A multimeter is often called a VOLT-OHM-MILLIAMMETER (VOM).
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the greatest advantages of a VOM is that no external power source is required for its
operation; therefore, no warm-up is necessary. Other advantages are its portability, versatility, and
freedom from calibration errors caused by aging tubes, line voltage variations, and so forth.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-1. What is one of the greatest advantages of a VOM?
Two disadvantages are that (1) the VOM tends to "load" the circuit under test, and (2) the meter
</p><p class="paragraph">movement is easily damaged as a result of improper testing procedures.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUTION-4-1-">CAUTION

</p><p class="paragraph">The multimeter has two selector switches. The switch on the lower left is the function switch, and the
one in the lower center is the range switch. The function switch selects the type of current you will be
measuring (+dc, - dc, or ac). The range switch is a 12-position switch that selects the range of ohmmeter,
voltmeter, or milliammeter measurements you will make.
</p><p class="paragraph">The multimeter is equipped with a pair of test leads; red is the positive lead and black is the negative,
or common, lead. Eight jacks are located on the lower part of the front panel. To prepare the meter for
use, simply insert the test leads into the proper jacks to obtain the circuit and range desired for each
application. In most applications, the black lead will be inserted into the jack marked at the lower left with
a negative sign ( - ) or with the word COMMON.
Measuring Resistance
</p><p class="paragraph">Before proceeding, you should be aware of the following important safety precaution that must be
observed when using the ohmmeter function of a VOM:
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUTION-4-3-">CAUTION
</h2><p class="paragraph">Never connect an ohmmeter to a "hot" (energized) circuit. Be sure that no power is applied
and that all capacitors are discharged.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-2. Before you connect a VOM in a circuit for an ohmmeter reading, in what condition must the
circuit be?
</p><p class="paragraph">The internal components of the multimeter use very little current and are protected from damage by
an overload protection circuit (fuse or circuit breaker). However, damage may still occur if you neglect
the safety precaution in the CAUTION instructions above.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because no external power is applied to the component being tested in a resistance check, a logical
question you may ask is, Where does the power for deflection of the ohmmeter come from? The
multimeter contains its own two-battery power supply inside the case. The resistive components inside
the multimeter are of such values that when the leads are connected together (no resistance), the meter
indicates a full-scale deflection. Because there is no resistance between the shorted leads, full-scale
deflection represents zero resistance.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before making a measurement, you must zero the ohmmeter to ensure accurate readings. This is
accomplished by shorting the leads together and adjusting the OHMS ADJ control so that the pointer is
pointing directly at the zero mark on the OHMS scale. The ZERO OHMS control is continuously variable
and is used to adjust the meter circuit sensitivity to compensate for battery aging in the ohmmeter circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">An important point to remember when you are making an accurate resistance measurement is to
"zero" the meter each time you select a new range. If this is not done, the readings you obtain will
probably be incorrect.
</p><p class="paragraph">When making a resistance measurement on a resistor, you must give the following considerations to
the resistor being tested:
</p><p class="paragraph">• The resistor must be electrically isolated. In some instances, a soldered connection will have to be
disconnected to isolate the resistor. Generally, isolating one side of the resistor is satisfactory for
you to make an accurate reading.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">4-4
</p><p class="paragraph">• The meter leads must make good electrical contact with the resistor leads. Points of contact
should be checked for dirt, grease, varnish, paint or any other material that may affect current
flow.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Touch only the insulated portions of the test leads. Your body has a certain amount of resistance,
which the ohmmeter will measure if you touch the uninsulated portions of the leads.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-2 is a functional block diagram of the ohmmeter circuit in a VOM. The proper method of
checking a resistor is to connect the red lead to one end of the resistor and the black lead to the other end
of the resistor.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because zero resistance causes full-scale deflection, you should realize that the deflection of the
meter is inversely proportional to the resistance being tested; that is, for a small resistance value, the
deflection will be nearly full scale; and for a large resistance value, the deflection will be considerably
less. This means that the left portion of the OHMS scale represents high resistance; the right side of the
scale represents low resistance. Zero resistance (a short circuit) is indicated on the extreme right side of
the scale; infinite resistance (an open circuit) is located on the extreme left side of the scale.
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that you read the OHMS scale on the multimeter from RIGHT to LEFT. For example, the
pointer of the multimeter in figure 4-3 indicates 8.0 ohms. To determine the actual value of a resistor,
multiply the reading on the meter scale by the range switch setting (R ·  1, R ·  100, or R ·  10,000).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">4-5
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that the scale marks are crowded on the left side of the OHMS scale, which makes them
difficult to read. Therefore, the best range to select is one in which the pointer will fall in the space from
midscale to slightly to the right side of midscale. The divisions in this area of the scale are evenly spaced
and provide for easier reading and greater accuracy.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-3. When taking resistance readings with a VOM, you will obtain the most accurate readings at or
near what part of the scale?
</p><p class="paragraph">To explain the relationship between the meter readings and the range switch setting, let’s use an
example. Suppose you have a 2,400-ohm resistor, which you have identified by the resistor color code.
With the range switch in the R ·  1 position, you connect the meter across the resistor. The meter point
then deflects between 200 and the point labeled with the infinity symbol ( ¥ ) on the extreme left side of
the scale. Because the R ·  1 range is selected, you multiply the reading by 1. Obviously, the scale reading
is not accurate enough. Therefore, you move the range selector switch to the next higher scale position (R
·  100) to obtain a more easily read value.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the R ·  100 position, you again zero the meter. This time, the pointer moves to the 24 mark on the
scale. Because the R ·  100 scale is selected, the reading is multiplied by 100. This gives a more accurate
reading of 2,400 ohms (24 times 100).
</p><p class="paragraph">If you position the range switch to the R ·  10,000 scale, accuracy decreases. The most accurate
readings are obtained at or near midscale. Other VOM instruments have ranges with other settings, such
as R ·  10, R ·  100, or R ·  1,000, to make it easier to make such readings.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another thing to remember when you are measuring resistance is the tolerance of the resistor. If the
tolerance of the resistor in the preceding example is 10 percent, we would expect a reading between
approximately 2,160 and 2,640 ohms. If the reading is not within these limits, the resistor has probably
changed value and should be discarded.
</p><p class="paragraph">An open resistor will indicate no deflection on the meter. A shorted resistor causes full-scale
deflection to the right on the lowest range scale, such as if the leads were shorted together.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">4-6
</p><h3 class="subsection">Measuring dc Voltages
</h3><p class="paragraph">You set the multimeter to operate as a dc voltmeter by placing the function switch in either of two
positions: +DC or - DC. The meter leads, as in the case of the ohmmeter function, must be connected to
the proper meter jacks. When you measure dc voltages, be sure the red lead is the positive lead and the
black lead is the negative, or common, lead. View A of figure 4-4 is a functional block diagram of dc
voltage circuits in a multimeter. View B shows the jacks and switch positions for measuring dc voltages.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the meter is connected in a circuit, it becomes a circuit component. Because all meters have
some resistance, they alter the circuit by changing the current. The resistance presented by the voltmeter
depends on the amount of voltage being measured and the position of the function switch.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some multimeters use a 20,000 ohms-per-volt meter sensitivity for measuring dc voltage and a 5,000
ohms-per-volt sensitivity for measuring ac voltage. The higher the meter resistance, the less it will load
the circuit. The idea is to keep circuit loading to an absolute minimum so that the circuit under test is
unaffected by the meter. In this way, you can get a clearer picture of what the circuit malfunction is, not
the effect of the meter on the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">Again, refer to figure 4-4. With the function switch set to either +DC or - DC, let’s consider the
effect of the range switch on the meter scale to be used. When measuring dc voltages, you have eight
voltage ranges available: .25V, 2.5V, 10V, 50V, 250V, and 500V (1- and 1,000-volt special application
plug-ins are also available). The setting of the range switch determines the maximum value represented
on the meter. When measuring dc voltages, use the scale marked DC (figure 4-3). The last number at the
extreme right side of the DC scale indicates the maximum value of the range being used. When the range
switch is in the 2.5V position, the scale represents a maximum of 2.5 volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">To simplify the relationship between the digits on the meter scale and the setting of the range switch,
always use the multiple of the full-scale-deflection digits on the meter face that correspond to the numbers
of the range switch. For example, use the 250 scale for the 250MV jack, 2.5V, and 250V ranges; the 50
on the scale for 50V and 500V ranges; and the 10 on the scale for the 10V and 1,000V ranges.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

higher range position, 50V. When you place the range switch to the 50V position (as shown in view B of
figure 4-4), the meter pointer should rise from a little more than midscale to 30, which represents 30 volts
dc.
</p><p class="paragraph">When measuring a known dc voltage, position the range switch to a setting that will cause
approximately midscale deflection. Readings taken near the center of the scale are the most accurate.
When measuring an unknown dc voltage, always begin on the highest voltage range. Using the range
switch, work down to an appropriate range. If the meter pointer moves to the left, you should reverse the
polarity of the function switch.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUTION-4-7-">CAUTION

</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-4. Besides setting up the meter for expected voltage ranges, what must be strictly observed when
taking dc voltage readings?
</p><p class="paragraph">Now let’s discuss how you take a voltage measurement on a component within a circuit. As an
example, let’s measure the voltage drop across the resistor shown in figure 4-5.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When measuring a dc voltage drop across a component in a circuit, you must connect the voltmeter
in parallel with the component. As you can see in figure 4-5, the positive (red) lead is connected to the
positive side of the resistor, and the negative (black) lead is connected to the negative side. A voltage
reading is obtained on the meter when current flows through the resistor.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some voltmeter readings will require the use of a ground as a reference point. Under these
conditions, one voltmeter lead is connected to the equipment ground, and the other lead is connected to
the test point where voltage is to be measured. Be sure to observe polarity.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Measuring ac Voltages
</h3><p class="paragraph">To measure ac voltages, you must set the function switch to the AC position. The same procedure
used to measure dc voltages applies, except that in reading the voltage, you use the AC volts scale (the

</h3><p class="paragraph">A dc high-voltage probe is available for use with the multimeter. The probe extends the range of the
multimeter in a safe and convenient manner. It is primarily used to measure high-voltage, low-power, dc-
current sources, such as the anode supplies in television receivers and other cathode-ray tube circuitry.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUTION-4-11-">CAUTION
</h2><p class="paragraph">Do not use this probe on electrical equipment that can deliver high power
under short-circuit conditions, such as from a large dc motor-generator set.
</p><p class="paragraph">Also available is an ac high-voltage probe. The 10,000-volt ac probe is similar to the high-voltage dc
probe with the following exceptions:
</p><p class="paragraph">• The ac high-voltage probe is designed primarily to extend the range of a 5,000-ohms-per-volt
VOM.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The probe is used with the VOM in the 10V AC position.
</p><p class="paragraph">• You take readings on the 0-10V AC scale and multiply by 1,000.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRONIC-DIGITAL-MULTIMETER-4-11-">ELECTRONIC DIGITAL MULTIMETER
</h2><p class="paragraph">As you studied in chapter 3 (externally excited meters), placing a meter into a circuit causes energy
to be taken from the circuit. The amount of energy taken depends on the sensitivity of the meter. In some
cases, this energy loss cannot be tolerated. For example, in extremely sensitive circuits, such as oscillator
grid circuits and automatic volume control circuits, degradation of normal circuit operation will occur.
This often results in failure to obtain a usable indication of the fault. The use of electronic multimeters is
practical in these sensitive electronic circuits. The higher the input impedance of a meter, the less the
loading effect and the more accurate the measurements taken. Electronic multimeters have considerably
greater input impedances than do nonelectronic multimeters.
</p><p class="paragraph">One example of a typical electronic multimeter in use within the Navy is the electronic Model
8000A Digital Multimeter. Most electronic digital multimeters overcome the disadvantage of requiring a
continuous external power source by combining an external ac source with an internal rechargeable
battery. Another advantage of this meter is that it can be read directly and does not use a scale. Figure 4-8
shows the model 8000A multimeter.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Operating Features
</h3><p class="paragraph">The locations of all controls, connectors, and indicators are shown in figure 4-8. The INPUT
terminals, located on the left-hand side of the meter face, provide input connections for voltage or
resistance (V-?) and milliampere current (MA) measurements with respect to the common terminal. The
readout section, located across the upper half of the meter face, contains light-emitting diode (LED)
indicators. They display the measured input and polarity signs for dc measurements. The POWER switch,
located on the lower right-hand side of the meter face, is a push-button switch used to energize the
instrument. The RANGE switches, located on the lower, middle, right-hand portion of the meter face,
select the voltage (200 millivolts, 2, 20, 200, or 1,200 volts), current (200 microamperes, 2, 200, or 2,000
milliamperes), and resistance (200 ohms, 2, 20, 200, or 2,000 kilohms) ranges. The FUNCTION switches,
located on the lower, middle, left-hand portion of the meter face, select the voltage, current, or resistance
modes. The MA input terminal is also a fuse holder for the current protection fuse.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Internal Battery Models
</h3><p class="paragraph">Power is supplied by internal rechargeable batteries that allow the instrument to operate for at least 8
hours. Recharging the batteries is accomplished by switching the POWER switch to OFF and connecting
the instrument to an ac power line. You can use the instrument when recharging the batteries on ac power,
but the recharging time will be extended.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-5. Power for the electronic digital multimeter is normally supplied by what internal power source?
Overload Protection
</p><p class="paragraph">An overload condition is indicated by the simultaneous flashing of the display readouts. The dc
voltage function can withstand up to 1,200 volts dc or 1,200 volts root-mean-square (rms) on any range.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-6. How is an overload condition indicated by the electronic digital multimeter?
The ac voltage function can sustain up to 1,200 volts rms on the 20-, 200-, and 1,200-volt ranges and
</p><p class="paragraph">500 volts rms on the 200-millivolt and 2-volt ranges. The current input fuse is protected above 2 amperes
rms. Protection for the resistance function is to 130 volts rms in the 200-ohm and 2-kilohm ranges, and
250 volts rms in the 20-kilohm through 20-megohm ranges.

integrated circuit (ic). This frequency is characteristic of the magnitude and polarity of the dc input
voltage. Counting of the output frequency from the analog ic is accomplished by the digital ic. The

</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-8. What is the general function of the differential voltmeter?
The differential voltmeter can be used as a conventional TRANSISTORIZED ELECTRONIC
</p><p class="paragraph">VOLTMETER (TVM) and a DIFFERENTIAL NULL VOLTMETER. It can also be used to measure
variations of a voltage near some known value (NULL DETECTOR), high resistance values
(MEGGOMETER), and for dBm measurements.
METER DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS
</p><p class="paragraph">The differential voltmeter is a solid-state instrument that provides the capability of making dc
voltage measurements from +/ -  10 microvolts to +/ -  1,100 volts. Ac voltages from 0.001 to 1,100 volts
can be measured over a frequency range from 5 hertz to 100 kilohertz. Both of these measurements can be
made without concern for loading the circuit. The differential voltmeter has four voltage readout dials that
vary the resistance of the divider assembly as described above.
</p><p class="paragraph">The differential voltmeter uses a built-in NULL DETECTOR to measure an unknown voltage. The
meter circuitry compares the unknown voltage to a known, adjustable reference voltage supplied by the
meter. The reference voltage is provided by a high-voltage dc power supply and decade resistor divider
assembly strings that are set by voltage readout dials. In this way, the output from the high-voltage power
supply can be precisely divided into increments as small as 10 microvolts. The readout dials are used to
adjust the meter pointer to 0 and the unknown voltage is then read from the voltage dials.
</p><p class="paragraph">A primary feature of the differential voltmeter is that it does not draw current from the unknown
source for dc measurements when the measurement is obtained. Therefore, the determination of the
unknown dc potential is independent of its source.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FRONT-PANEL-CONTROLS-4-17-">FRONT PANEL CONTROLS

reference supply, a resistive divider, a dc input divider, an ac converter, a null detector, and a meter. The
circuitry is interconnected by various switching arrangements when you perform the desired ac or dc
conventional or differential voltage measurements.
</p><p class="paragraph">Placing the MODE switch in figure 4-16 to the AC position connects the instrument circuitry as a
conventional transistorized ac voltmeter. A full-scale input voltage at the input terminals of the instrument
results in a voltage being applied to the input of the null detector. The null detector drives the front panel
meter that indicates the value of the measured ac voltage.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Differential Null Mode
</h3><p class="paragraph">When the instrument is used as a dc differential voltmeter, the MODE and NULL SENS switches in
figure 4-16 are placed to their respective +/ -  dc and desired full-scale meter sensitivity positions. In this
mode of operation, the NULL SENS switch selects a suitable resistance value to determine the full-scale
sensitivity of the meter. The dc input voltage applied to the instrument is then compared with the null
detector, and any resulting difference is used to drive the meter. The meter terminals can be reversed
through the contacts of the MODE switch for +/ -  dc voltage measurements.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-18 is a panel view of the model 250DE bridge switches, dials, controls, and connections.
Refer to the figure as we briefly discuss some of the switches and dials below.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The FUNCTION switch selects the type of bridge circuit that will measure resistance,
capacitance, or inductance.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The RANGE switch selects the multiplier for each function.
</p><p class="paragraph">• L-R-C decade dials are a DEKASTAT decade resistor that is the main balancing element of the
bridge. The setting of the dials after the bridge is balanced indicates the value of inductance,
resistance, or capacitance.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The D-Q dial is used to balance the phase of the capacitance or inductance of the bridge. The
setting of the dial after the bridge is balanced indicates the value of dissipation factor (D) or
storage factor (Q).
</p><p class="paragraph">• The GEN-DET switch selects bridge generator and detector connections, ac or dc, internal or
external generator. The switch also connects the internal batteries to the battery test circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The DET GAIN control adjusts the sensitivity of the ac-dc detector and turns on power to the
generator.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CONNECTIONS-4-23-">CONNECTIONS
</h2><p class="paragraph">L, R, and C terminals 1, 2, and 3 are used to connect unknown resistors, inductors, and capacitors to
the bridge. Resistors and inductors are connected between terminals 1 and 2, and capacitors are connected
between terminals 2 and 3. EXT BIAS terminals are normally connected with a shorting lug. They allow
insertion of a dc voltage or current to bias capacitors or inductors. EXT DET connector is a BNC coaxial
socket that allows an external detector to be used with the instrument. It is connected to the bridge at ALL
TIMES.
</p><p class="paragraph">EXT D-Q terminals are normally connected with a shorting lug. They allow an external rheostat to
extend the range of the D-Q dial. EXT GEN terminals provide a connection to the bridge for an external
generator. When the GEN-DET switch is in the AC EXT GEN position, the terminals connect an isolation
transformer so that a grounded external generator can be used. When the GEN-DET switch is in the DC
EXT GEN position, the terminals are connected directly to the bridge.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BATTERY-4-23-">BATTERY
</h2><p class="paragraph">The model 250DE bridge has a battery supply consisting of four 1.5 V dc batteries with an expected
life of 500 hours. The battery power supply should be checked before each day’s operation. Turn DET
GAIN control to 1 and set GEN-DET switch to BATT. TEST (battery test). If the meter deflects beyond
the BAT OK mark, the battery is good.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RESISTANCE-MEASUREMENTS-4-23-">RESISTANCE MEASUREMENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Resistance is usually measured with direct current for maximum accuracy. The model 250DE bridge
can be used to measure resistance with alternating current, but external reactance compensation is usually
required. On high-resistance ranges, care should be taken to avoid leakage across a resistor under test.
Insulation with a resistance of 109 ohms, which is adequate for most purposes, will cause a measurement</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

kilohertz. Other frequencies can be used, but an external generator and detector are required. The D and Q
ranges of the bridge can be extended by use of an external rheostat connected to the terminals provided.
The measured capacitance is the product of the L-R-C dial setting times the setting of the RANGE switch.
Using the following steps, you can make a standard capacitance measurement:

</p><p class="paragraph">The HP-431C power meter indirectly measures microwave frequency power by using two bridge 
circuitsthe detection bridge and the compensation and metering bridge. The detection bridge

</h3><p class="paragraph">the maintenance of electronic equipment. These sources, called SIGNAL GENERATORS, are used to test 
</p><p class="paragraph">and align all types of transmitters and receivers. They are also used to troubleshoot various electronic

</p><h3 class="subsection">The function of a signal generator is to produce alternating current (ac) of the desired frequencies 
</h3><p class="paragraph">and amplitudes with the necessary modulation for testing or measuring circuits. (Modulation was 
</p><p class="paragraph">discussed in NEETS, Module 12, Modulation Principles.) It is important that the amplitude of the signal 
generated by the signal generator be correct. In many signal generators, output meters are included in the 
</p><p class="paragraph">equipment to adjust and maintain the output at standard levels over wide ranges of frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When using the signal generator, you connect the output test signal into the circuit being tested. You 
</p><h3 class="subsection">can then trace the progress of the test signal through the equipment by using electronic voltmeters or 
</h3><p class="paragraph">oscilloscopes. In many signal generators, calibrated networks of resistors, called ATTENUATORS, are

</p><p class="paragraph">Q-3. In signal generators, what device is used to regulate the voltage of the output signal? 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are many types of signal generators. They are classified by use and the frequency range

</p><p class="paragraph">difference between the frequencies of the two oscillators is equal to the desired audio or video frequency. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Audio signal generators often include resistance-capacitance (rc) oscillators in which the af is

</p><p class="paragraph">part of the oscillator. The frequency varies when either the resistance or the capacitance is changed in 
value. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In other signal generators, however, the capacitance alone is often chosen as the only variable 
element. The change in frequency that can be produced by this method is limited, and it is usually 
</p><p class="paragraph">necessary to cover the entire range of the generator in frequency steps. This is usually accomplished by 
</p><h3 class="subsection">providing several rc circuits, each corresponding to a specific portion of the entire range of frequency

</h3><h3 class="subsection">In addition to the necessary power supply, a typical rf signal generator contains three other main 
</h3><p class="paragraph">sections: an OSCILLATOR CIRCUIT, a MODULATOR, and an OUTPUT CONTROL CIRCUIT. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">modulator modulates the rf signal of the oscillator. In addition, most rf generators are provided with 
</p><h3 class="subsection">connections through which an external source of modulation of any desired waveform can be applied to 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the generated signal. Metal shielding surrounds the unit to prevent signals from the oscillator from 
</p><p class="paragraph">affecting the circuit under test. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-4. Name the three main sections of a typical rf signal generator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A block diagram of a representative rf signal generator is shown in figure 5-7. The function of the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">oscillator stage is to produce a signal that can be accurately set in frequency at any point within the range 
</h3><p class="paragraph">of the generator. The type of oscillator circuit used depends on the range of frequencies for which the 
</p><p class="paragraph">generator is designed. In lower frequency rf signal generators, the oscillating circuit consists of one of a 
</p><p class="paragraph">group of coils combined with a variable capacitor. One of the coils is selected by the position of a range 
</p><p class="paragraph">selector switch that connects the coil to a capacitor to provide an inductance-capacitance circuit. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">inductive-capacitance circuit then has the correct range of resonant frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The function of the modulator is to produce an audio (or video) modulating signal that can be 
</h3><p class="paragraph">superimposed on the rf signal produced by the oscillator. The modulating signal may be provided by an 
</p><p class="paragraph">audio oscillator within the generator. This is termed INTERNAL MODULATION. It may also be derived 
</p><p class="paragraph">from an external source. This is termed EXTERNAL MODULATION. In some signal generators, either 
</p><p class="paragraph">of these two methods of modulation can be employed. In addition, a means of disabling the modulator 
</p><p class="paragraph">section is available so that the pure, unmodulated signal from the oscillator can be used when desired. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-5. What is the function of the modulating circuit? 
</p><p class="paragraph">The type of modulation selected depends on the application of the particular signal generator. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">modulating signal may be a sine wave, a square wave, or pulses of varying duration. In some special

</p><h3 class="subsection">Time Interval Averaging 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The time interval averaging technique is based on the fact that if the ±1 count error is truly random, 
it can be reduced by averaging a number of measurements. The words "truly random" are significant. For 
</p><h3 class="subsection">time interval averaging to work, the time interval must (1) be repetitive and (2) have a repetition 
</h3><p class="paragraph">frequency that is asynchronous to the instrument's clock. Under these conditions, the resolution of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">measurement is: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">With averaging, resolution of a time interval measurement is limited only by the noise inherent in the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">instrument. The 5328A can obtain 10-picoseconds resolution. Most time interval averaging has one 
</p><p class="paragraph">severe limitation: The clock period limits the minimum measurable time interval. With the FUNCTION 
</p><p class="paragraph">selector switch in the T.I. AVG AB position, synchronizers are used to remove this limitation. These 
</p><p class="paragraph">synchronizers enable the 5328A to measure intervals as short as 100 picoseconds. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Referring to figure 5-16, note that the input waveshape shows a repetitive time interval, which is 
</h3><p class="paragraph">asynchronous to the square wave clock. When these signals are applied to the main gate, with no 
</p><p class="paragraph">synchronizers, an output similar to the third waveform results. Since the DCAs are designed to count at 
</p><h3 class="subsection">the clock frequency and are unable to accept pulses of shorter duration than the clock, the resulting counts 
</h3><p class="paragraph">accumulated in the DCAs will be in error, as shown in the fourth waveform. This problem is alleviated by 
</p><h3 class="subsection">the synchronizers, which are designed to detect leading edges of the clock pulses that occur while the gate 
</h3><p class="paragraph">is open. They detect and reconstruct the leading edges, making the pulses applied to the DCAs the same 
</p><p class="paragraph">duration as the clock, as shown in the fifth waveform. Occasionally, when the input time interval

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OPERATION-5-25-">OPERATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The following sections explain how to use most of the front- and back-panel controls and connectors. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each control and connector has already been briefly described. To review this information, refer to figure 
</p><p class="paragraph">5-18 and table 5-3. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Initial Setup 
</h3><p class="paragraph">First, turn the POWER/INTENSITY knob located on the front panel to the clockwise, on, position. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Under normal conditions, the unit will come on with the following LEDs illuminated: power, channel A, 
</h3><p class="paragraph">50/60 Hz, low range, and pulse/DC. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Focusing the CRT is very critical for the technician to be able to properly analyze the signature being 
</h3><p class="paragraph">displayed. This is done by first turning the INTENSITY control to a level comfortable for the eye, and 
</p><p class="paragraph">then adjusting the FOCUS control (back panel) for the narrowest possible trace. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Aligning the trace will help determine, during troubleshooting, which quadrant the portion of the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">signature is in during a change. With a short circuit applied to channel A (connect a cable between jack A 
</p><h3 class="subsection">and COM), adjust the TRACE ROTATE control until the trace is as close to parallel as possible to the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">vertical axis. Then, adjust the HORIZ (horizontal) control until the vertical trace is as close to even with 
</p><p class="paragraph">the vertical axis as possible. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-9. When aligning the trace with a short applied to channel A, which control should be adjusted to 
bring the trace parallel to the vertical axis? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">With an Open applied to channel A (nothing connected to A and COM test plug), adjust the VERT 
</h3><p class="paragraph">(vertical) control until the horizontal trace is as close to even with the horizontal axis as possible. Once 
</p><p class="paragraph">set, these adjustments should not need readjusting during the unit's operation. However, remember that 
</p><p class="paragraph">each time the unit is used, this process will need to be repeated. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Range Selection 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Four impedance ranges (LOW, MED 1, MED 2, and HIGH) can be selected on the Tracker 2000. 
</p><p class="paragraph">These ranges will become active when the appropriate front-panel button is pressed. To obtain the most 
</p><h3 class="subsection">useful signature display when troubleshooting a component, you should always start by selecting one of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the two medium ranges (medium 1 or medium 2). If the display appears to be an open (horizontal trace), 
</p><p class="paragraph">then the next higher range should be selected to get a more accurate signature for analysis. If the display 
</p><p class="paragraph">appears to be a short (vertical trace), then the next lower range should be selected. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">hands free to hold test leads while still being able to observe the component under test signature for 
</h3><p class="paragraph">analysis. The HIGH LOCKOUT, when selected by the technician, prevents the unit from functioning in 
</p><p class="paragraph">the HIGH range in either the manual or AUTO mode. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Channel Selection 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">You can select two channels by pressing the channel A (test probes connected to A jack and COM) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">or channel B (test probes connected to B and COM jacks) push button on the front panel. When using a 
</p><h3 class="subsection">single channel, you should plug the red probe into the corresponding channel test jack, and plug the black 
</h3><p class="paragraph">test lead into the common test jack. When testing a component, you should connect the red probe to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">positive terminal and the black probe to the negative terminal of the component under test. Following this 
</p><h3 class="subsection">procedure every time will ensure that the signature for the component under test will be displayed in the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">correct quadrants of the CRT display. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The ALT (alternate) mode provides automatic switching back and forth between channel A and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">channel B. This allows you to easily compare two components or the same test points on two circuit 
</p><p class="paragraph">boards. You select the ALT mode by pressing the ALT push button on the front panel. The rate of 
</p><h3 class="subsection">switching between channels A and B can be varied by adjusting the RATE control knob on the front 
</h3><p class="paragraph">panel. You will find that the ALT mode feature is very useful for comparing a known good component 
</p><p class="paragraph">with the same type of component that is of unknown quality. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Figure 5-21 shows a typical way of connecting the unit to a known good circuit board and a board 
</h3><p class="paragraph">under test. This test mode uses the supplied common test leads to connect two equivalent points on the 
</p><p class="paragraph">boards to the common test jack. Note that the black probe is now being used in the channel B jack rather 
</p><p class="paragraph">than the COM jack. When the technician uses the ALT and AUTO features together, each channel is 
</p><p class="paragraph">displayed before the range selection will change. Figure 5-22 shows the sequence of these changes.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Pulse Generator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A built-in pulse generator is also provided with the Tracker 2000. It allows the technician to do 
</p><p class="paragraph">dynamic, in-circuit testing of certain devices in their active mode. In addition to using the red and black

</p><h3 class="subsection">After a button is pushed, the unit will remain in that configuration until another selection is made or 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the power is secured. The HIGH LOCKOUT and PULSE GENERATOR push buttons are the only ones 
</p><p class="paragraph">that require repetitive pressing to be turned on or off. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The channel relay is controlled by CHANNEL buttons A, ALT, and B. The relay is a single-pole,

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-6-1-">INTRODUCTION
</h2><p class="paragraph">One of the most widely used pieces of electronic test equipment is the OSCILLOSCOPE. An
oscilloscope is used to show the shape of a video pulse appearing at a selected equipment test point.
Although some oscilloscopes are better than others in accurately showing video pulses, all function in
fundamentally the same way. If you learn how one oscilloscope operates, you will be able to learn others.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you will learn in this chapter, there are many different types of oscilloscopes—varying in
complexity from the simple to the complex. Before we get into our discussion of the dual-trace
oscilloscope, we will first present a general overview of basic single-trace oscilloscope operation. Shortly,
we will see how oscilloscopes use a CATHODE-RAY TUBE (CRT) in which controlled electron beams
are used to present a visible pattern of graphical data on a fluorescent screen.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another piece of test equipment used is the SPECTRUM ANALYZER. This test equipment is used
to sweep over a band of frequencies to determine what frequencies are being produced by a specific
circuit under test, and then the amplitude of each frequency component. An accurate interpretation of the
display will allow you to determine the efficiency of the equipment being tested.

Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies. Before continuing with your study of CRTs in this
section, you may want to review chapter 2 of that module.

deflection system moves the beam horizontally and vertically across the screen. The screen is coated with
a phosphorous material that glows when struck by the electrons. Figure 6-1 shows the construction of a
CRT.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRON-GUN-6-2-">ELECTRON GUN
</h2><p class="paragraph">The ELECTRON GUN consists of a HEATER and a CATHODE to generate electrons, a
CONTROL GRID to control brightness by controlling electron flow, and two ANODES (FIRST and
SECOND). The main purpose of the first (FOCUSING) anode is to focus the electrons into a narrow
beam on the screen. The second (ACCELERATING) anode accelerates the electrons as they pass. The
control grid is cylindrical and has a small opening in a baffle at one end. The anodes consist of two
cylinders that contain baffles (or plates) with small holes in their centers.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-1. What element controls the number of electrons striking the screen?
 Q-2. What element is controlled to focus the beam?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Cathode and Control Grid
</h3><p class="paragraph">As in most conventional electron tubes, the cathode is indirectly heated and emits a cloud of
electrons. The control grid is a hollow metal tube placed over the cathode. A small opening is located in
the center of a baffle at the end opposite the cathode. The control grid is maintained at a negative potential
with respect to the cathode to keep the electrons bunched together.
</p><p class="paragraph">A high positive potential on the anodes pulls electrons through the hole in the grid. Because the grid
is near the cathode, it can control the number of electrons that are emitted. As in an ordinary electron
tube, the negative voltage of the grid can be varied either to control electron flow or stop it completely.
The brightness (intensity) of the image on the fluorescent screen is determined by the number of electrons
striking the screen. This is controlled by the voltage on the control grid.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Electrostatic Lenses and Focusing
</h3><p class="paragraph">The electron beam is focused by two ELECTROSTATIC FIELDS that exist between the control grid
and first anode and between the first and second anodes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 6-2 shows you how electrons move through the electron gun. The electrostatic field areas are
often referred to as LENSES because the fields bend electron streams in the same manner that optical</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">lenses bend light rays. The first electrostatic lens cause the electrons to cross at the first focal point within
the field. The second lens bend the spreading streams and return them to a new, second focal point at the
CRT.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-3. Why are the electrostatic fields between the electron gun elements called lenses?
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 6-2 also shows the relative voltage relationships on the electron-gun elements. The cathode
(K) is at a fixed positive voltage with respect to ground. The grid is at a variable negative voltage with
respect to the cathode. A fixed positive voltage of several thousand volts is connected to the second
(accelerating) anode. The potential of the first (focusing) anode is less positive than the potential of the
second anode. The first anode can be varied to place the focal point of the electron beam on the screen of
the tube. Control-grid potential is established at the proper level to allow the correct number of electrons
through the gun for the desired image intensity.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-4. What is the function of the second anode?
ELECTRON BEAM-DEFLECTION SYSTEM
</p><p class="paragraph">The electron beam is developed, focused, and accelerated by the electron gun. The beam appears on
the screen of the CRT as a small, bright dot. If the beam is left in one position, the electrons will soon
burn away the illuminating coating in that one area. To be of any use, the beam must be able to move. As
you have studied, an electrostatic field can bend the path of a moving electron.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you have seen in the previous illustrations, the beam of electrons passes through an electrostatic
field between two plates. You should remember that electrons are negatively charged and that they will be
deflected in the direction of the electric force (from negative to positive). This deflection causes the
electrons to follow a curved path while in the electrostatic field.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">6-4
</p><p class="paragraph">When the electrons leave the electrostatic field, they will take a straight path to the screen at the
angle at which they left the field. Because they were all deflected equally, the electrons will be traveling
toward the same spot. Of course, the proper voltages must exist on the anodes to produce the electrostatic
field. Changing these voltages changes the focal point of the beam and causes the electron beam to strike
the CRT at a different point.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Factors Influencing Deflection
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ANGLE OF DEFLECTION (the angle the outgoing electron beam makes with the CRT center
line axis between the plates) depends on the following factors:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Length of the deflection field;
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Spacing between the deflection plates;
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• The difference of potential between the plates; and
</h3><p class="paragraph">• The accelerating voltage on the second anode.
</p><p class="paragraph">LENGTH OF DEFLECTION FIELD.—As shown in figure 6-3, a long field (long deflection
plates) has more time to exert its deflecting forces on an electron beam than does a shorter field (short
deflection plates). Therefore, the longer deflection plates can bend the beam to a greater deflection angle.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-5. What effect do longer deflection plates have on the electron beam?
SPACING BETWEEN PLATES.—As shown in figure 6-4, the closer together the plates, the more

</p><h3 class="subsection">Vertical and Horizontal Plates
</h3><p class="paragraph">If two sets of deflection plates are placed at right angles to each other inside a CRT (figure 6-7), the
electron beam can be controlled in any direction. By varying the potential of the vertical-deflection plates,
you can make the spot (beam) on the face of the tube move vertically. The distance the beam moves will
be proportional to the change in potential difference between the plates. Changing the potential difference
between the horizontal-deflection plates will cause the beam to move a given distance from one side to
the other. Directions other than up-down and left-right are achieved by a combination of horizontal and
vertical movement.
</p><p class="paragraph">As shown in figure 6-8, position X of the beam is in the center. It can be moved to position Y by
going up 2 units and then right 2 units. Movement of the beam is the result of the simultaneous action of
both sets of deflection plates. The electrostatic field between the vertical plates moves the electrons up an
amount proportional to 2 units on the screen. As the beam passes between the horizontal plates, it moves
to the right an amount proportional to 2 units on the screen.

</p><p class="paragraph">If the amount of deflection from the left and down occurred so that each set of plates acted at the
same time, the picture would be like the one in view A of figure 6-9. For example, if the vertical plates
moved the beam downward (starting from point X) at the rate of 3 units per second and the horizontal
plates moved it to the left at the rate of 1 unit per second, both movements would have been completed in
1 second at point Y. The result would be a straight line.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view B, the potentials on the vertical and horizontal plates change at the same rate. In the same
time period, say 1 second, both plates move the beam 1 unit. The horizontal plates have completed their
task at the end of 1 second, but the vertical plates have moved the beam only one-third of the required
distance. In this case, the picture in view B would appear on the screen.

</p><p class="paragraph">1. From T0 to T1, the vertical plates maintain their static difference in potential and the beam stays
at 0 units; the T0 to T1 change causes an increasing potential difference in the horizontal plates,
and the beam moves 1 unit to the right.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. At T1, a positive potential difference change in the vertical plates occurs, which causes the beam
to move up (instantaneously) 2 units. This vertical (amplitude) beam location is maintained from
T1 to T4; horizontal beam movement continues moving to the right as 3 units of time pass.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. At T4, an instantaneous negative change in potential of 4 units in amplitude occurs, and the beam
moves from +2 to - 2 units.
</p><p class="paragraph">4. From T4 to T7, the beam remains at - 2 units. During this time period, the beam continues
moving horizontally to the right, indicating the passage of time.
</p><p class="paragraph">5. At T7, a positive increase of amplitude occurs, and the beam moves vertically from - 2 to 0 units.
From T7 to T8, no change occurs in vertical beam movement; however, horizontal movement
continues with time.
</p><p class="paragraph">The vertical-plate potential difference follows the voltage of the waveform. The horizontal-plate

</p><p class="paragraph">HORIZONTAL-DEFLECTION PLATES.—Now let's look at horizontal-deflection action.
Assume that the resistance of the potentiometer shown in figure 6-11 is spread evenly along its length.
When the arm of the potentiometer is at the middle position, the same potential exists on each plate. Since
there is zero potential difference between the plates, an electrostatic field is not moved downward at a
uniform rate; the right plate will become more positive than the left (you are looking down through the
top of the CRT). The electron beam will move to the right from screen point 0 through points 1, 2, 3, and
4 in equal time intervals.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">If the potentiometer arm is moved at the same rate in the opposite direction, the right plate will
decrease in positive potential until the beam returns to the 0 position. At that point, the potential
difference between the plates is again zero. Moving the arm toward the other end of the resistance causes
the left plate to become more positive than the right, and the beam moves from screen points 0 through 4.
If the movement of the potentiometer arm is at a uniform (linear) rate, the beam moves at a uniform rate.
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that the ends of the deflection plates are bent outward to permit wide-angle deflection of the
beam. The vertical plates are bent up and down in the same manner.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-12. Why are the ends of the deflection plates bent outward?
For ease of explanation, the manual movement of the potentiometer arm is satisfactory to introduce
</p><p class="paragraph">you to horizontal beam movement. However, in the oscilloscope this is not how horizontal deflection is
accomplished. Beam movement voltages are produced much faster by sawtooth circuitry. You may want
to review the sawtooth generation section in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and
Wave-Shaping Circuitry before continuing. Nearly all oscilloscopes with electrostatic deflection apply a
sawtooth voltage to the horizontal plates to produce horizontal deflection of the beam, as shown in
figure 6-12.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the figure, the sawtooth generator replaces the potentiometer and is connected to both horizontal
plates of the CRT. At the reference line, the potential on both plates is equal. Below the line, the left plate
is more positive and the right plate is less positive. This causes the beam to move left. Above the line, the
right plate is made more positive than the left and the beam moves to the right. The waveform amplitude
causes a uniform movement of the beam across the screen (called TRACE). RETRACE time, shown at
the trailing edge of the waveform, quickly deflects the beam back to the starting point.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CRT-GRATICULE-6-10-">CRT GRATICULE
</h2><p class="paragraph">A GRATICULE was used in our previous discussion in figure 6-10. It is simply a calibrated scale
(made of clear plastic) of amplitude versus time that is placed on the face of the CRT.
</p><p class="paragraph">The graticule can be used to determine the voltage of waveforms because the DEFLECTION
SENSITIVITY of a CRT is uniform throughout the vertical plane of the screen. Deflection sensitivity
states the number of inches, centimeters, or millimeters a beam will be deflected for each volt of potential
difference applied to the deflection plates. It is directly proportional to the physical length of the
deflection plates and their distance from the screen and inversely proportional to the distance between the
plates and to the second-anode voltage. Deflection sensitivity is a constant that is dependent on the
construction of the tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">Deflection sensitivity for a given CRT might typically be 0.2 millimeters per volt. This means the
spot on the screen will be deflected 0.2 millimeters (about 0.008 inch) when a difference of 1 volt exists
between the plates. Sometimes the reciprocal of deflection sensitivity (called DEFLECTION FACTOR)
is given. The deflection factor for the example given would be 125 volts per inch (1/0.008).
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-13. What term is used to describe the reciprocal of deflection sensitivity of a scope?
In the above example, 125 volts applied between one set of plates would deflect the beam 1 inch on
</p><p class="paragraph">the screen. This means that the deflection caused by small signals would likely not be observed. For this
reason, the deflection plates are connected to amplifiers that magnify the signals applied to the vertical
input of the scope.
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume, for example, that a peak-to-peak value of a known voltage applied to the oscilloscope
indicates that each inch marking on the graticule is equal to 60 volts. Each of the 10 subdivisions will,
therefore, equal a value of 6 volts. Most oscilloscopes have ATTENUATOR controls to decrease or
GAIN controls to increase the strength of a signal before it is placed on the deflection plates. Attenuator
and gain settings must not be disturbed after the calibration has been made. For maximum accuracy, you
should recalibrate the graticule each time a voltage is to be measured.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CRT-DESIGNATIONS-6-10-">CRT DESIGNATIONS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Cathode-ray tubes are identified by a tube number, such as 2AP1, 2BP4, or 5AP1A. The first number
identifies the diameter of the tube face. Typical diameters are 2 inches, 5 inches, and 7 inches. The first
letter designates the order in which a tube of a given diameter was registered. The letter-digit combination
indicates the type of phosphor (glowing material) used on the inside of the screen. Phosphor P1, which is
used in most oscilloscopes, produces a green light at medium PERSISTENCE. Persistence refers to the
length of time the phosphor glows after the electron beam is removed. P4 provides a white light and has a
short persistence. If a letter appears at the end, it signifies the number of the modification after the
original design.

</p><p class="paragraph">The VERTICAL-DEFLECTION AMPLIFIER increases the amplitude of the input signal level
required for the deflection of the CRT beam. The deflection amplifier must not have any other effect on
the signal, such as changing the shape (called DISTORTION). Figure 6-21 shows the results of distortion
occurring in a deflection amplifier.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Attenuator Control
</h3><p class="paragraph">An amplifier can handle only a limited range of input amplitudes before it begins to distort the
signal. Signal distortion is prevented in oscilloscopes by the incorporation of circuitry that permits
adjustment of the input signal amplitude to a level that prevents distortion from occurring. This
adjustment is called the ATTENUATOR control in some scopes (VOLTS/DIV and VAR in figure 6-19).
This control extends the usefulness of the oscilloscope by enabling it to handle a wide range of signal
amplitudes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The attenuator usually consists of two controls. One is a multiposition (VOLTS/DIV) control, and
the other is a variable (VAR) potentiometer. Each position of the control may be marked either as to the
amount of voltage required to deflect the beam a unit distance, such as VOLTS/DIV, or as to the amount
of attenuation (called the DEFLECTION FACTOR) given to the signal, such as 100, 10, or 1.
</p><p class="paragraph">Suppose the .5 VOLTS/DIV position were selected. In this position, the beam would deflect
vertically 1 division for every 0.5 volts of applied signal. If a sine wave occupied 4 divisions peak-to-
peak, its amplitude would be 2 volts peak-to-peak (4 ·  0.5), as shown in figure 6-22.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

signal level to the amplifiers by steps. These steps are sequenced from low to high deflection factors. The
potentiometer control (VAR in figure 6-19) provides a means of fine, or variable, control between steps.
This control may be mounted separately, or it may be mounted on the attenuator control. When the
control is mounted separately, it is often marked as FINE GAIN or simply GAIN. When mounted on the
attenuator control, it is usually marked VARIABLE or VAR.
</p><p class="paragraph">The variable control adds attenuation to the step that is selected. Since accurately calibrating a
potentiometer is difficult, the variable control is either left unmarked or the front panel is marked off in
some convenient units, such as 1-10 and 1-100. The attenuator control, however, can be accurately
calibrated. To do this, you turn off the variable control to remove it from the attenuator circuit. This
position is usually marked CAL (calibrate) on the panel, or an associated light indicates if the VAR
control is on or off. In figure 6-19, the light called UNCAL indicates the VAR control is in the
uncalibrated position.

The frequency of the time base is variable, which enables the oscilloscope to accept a wide range of input
frequencies. Again, two controls are used (figure 6-24). One is a multiposition switch (TIME/DIV) that
changes the frequency of the sweep generator in steps. The second control is a potentiometer (VAR) that
varies the frequency between steps. Each step on the TIME/DIV control is calibrated. The front panel has
markings that group the numbers into microseconds and milliseconds.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

(3 ·  10). Recall that the frequency for a signal may be found by using the following procedure:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

input signal requires 5 milliseconds to complete one cycle and the sawtooth is set for 0.5 milliseconds per
centimeter with a 10-centimeter-wide graticule, then approximately one cycle will be displayed. If the

</p><p class="paragraph">In the basic oscilloscope, the sweep generator runs continuously (FREE-RUNNING); in more
elaborate oscilloscopes, it is normally turned off. In the oscilloscope we’re using as an example, the sweep
generator can be triggered by the input signal or by a signal from some other source. (Triggering will be
discussed later in this chapter.) This type of oscilloscope is called a triggered oscilloscope. The triggered
oscilloscope permits more accurate time measurements to be made and provides a more stable
presentation than the nontriggered-type oscilloscope.
</p><p class="paragraph">On some oscilloscopes, you will find a 10 times (10X) magnification control. As previously
mentioned, this allows the displayed sweep to be magnified by a factor of 10.

</p><p class="paragraph">The TRIGGER LEVEL (mounted with the TRIGGER SLOPE on some scopes) determines the

</p><p class="paragraph">In most scopes, an automatic function of the trigger circuitry allows a free-running trace without a
trigger signal. However, when a trigger signal is applied, the circuit reverts to the triggered mode of
operation and the sweep is no longer free running. This action provides a trace when no signal is applied.
</p><p class="paragraph">Synchronization is also used to cause a free-running condition without a trigger signal.
Synchronization is not the same as triggering. TRIGGERING refers to a specific action or event that
initiates an operation. Without this event, the operation would not occur. In the case of the triggered
sweep, the sweep will not be started until a trigger is applied. Each succeeding sweep must have a trigger
before a sweep commences. SYNCHRONIZATION, however, means that an operation or event is
brought into step with a second operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">A sweep circuit that uses synchronization instead of triggering will cause a previously free-running
sweep to be locked in step with the synchronizing signal. The TRIGGER LEVEL control setting can be
increased until synchronization occurs; but, until that time, an unstable pattern will appear on the CRT
face.

reason, you may have to adjust the INTEN and FOCUS controls occasionally while taking readings.

TRACE operation.

CRT. This operation allows an accurate means of making amplitude, phase, time displacement, or
frequency comparisons and measurements between two signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">A dual-trace oscilloscope should not be confused with a dual-beam oscilloscope. Dual-beam
oscilloscopes produce two separate electron beams on a single scope, which can be individually or jointly
controlled. Dual-trace refers to a single beam in a CRT that is shared by two channels.

Consequently, the ALT mode is not used for slow sweep speeds. The CHOP mode, shown in figure 6-36

low speeds. Therefore, both are used on dual-trace oscilloscopes to complement each other and give the

from one channel. Then, when the gate samples the output of the CH 2 during time 3 to 4, the beam is at a
different vertical LOCATION. (This is assuming that CH 2 is at a different voltage reference.) The beam
continues in the sequence 5 to 6, 7 to 8, 9 to 10, and 11 to 12 through the rest of one horizontal sweep.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The basic dual-trace oscilloscope has one gun assembly and two vertical channels. However, there
are many variations. The horizontal sweep channels vary somewhat from equipment to equipment. Some
have one time-base circuit and others have two. These two are interdependent in some oscilloscopes and
in others they are independently controlled. Also, most modern general-purpose oscilloscopes are
constructed of modules. That is, most of the vertical circuitry is contained in a removable plug-in unit,
and most of the horizontal circuitry is contained in another plug-in unit.
</p><p class="paragraph">The main frame of the oscilloscope is often adapted for many other special applications by the
design of a variety of plug-in assemblies. This modular feature provides much greater versatility than in a
single-trace oscilloscope. For instance, to analyze the characteristics of a transistor, you can replace the
dual-trace, plug-in module with a semiconductor curve-tracer plug-in module.
</p><p class="paragraph">Other plug-in modules available with some oscilloscopes are high-gain, wide-bandwidth amplifiers;
differential amplifiers; spectrum analyzers; physiological monitors; and other specialized units. Therefore,
the dual-trace capability is a function of the type of plug-in unit that is used with some oscilloscopes.
</p><p class="paragraph">To get maximum usefulness from an oscilloscope, you must have a means of connecting the desired
signal to the oscilloscope input. Aside from cable connections between any equipment output and the
oscilloscope input, a variety of probes are available to assist in monitoring signals at almost any point in a
circuit. The more common types include 1-TO-1 PROBES, ATTENUATION PROBES, and CURRENT
PROBES. Each of these probes may be supplied with several different tips to allow measurement of
signals on any type of test point. Figure 6-40 shows some of the more common probe tips.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In choosing the probe to use for a particular measurement, you must consider such factors as circuit
loading, signal amplitude, and scope sensitivity.
</p><p class="paragraph">The 1-to-1 probe offers little or no attenuation of the signal under test and is, therefore, useful for
measuring low-level signals. However, circuit loading with the 1-to-1 probe may be a problem. The
impedance at the probe tip is the same as the input impedance of the oscilloscope.
</p><p class="paragraph">An attenuator probe has an internal high-value resistor in series with the probe tip. This gives the
probe a higher input impedance than that of the oscilloscope. Because of the higher input impedance, the
probe can measure high-amplitude signals that would overdrive the vertical amplifier if connected
directly to the oscilloscope. Figure 6-41 shows a schematic representation of a basic attenuation probe.
The 9-megohm resistor in the probe and the 1-megohm input resistor of the oscilloscope form a 10-to-1
voltage divider.

</p><p class="paragraph">Since the probe resistor is in series, the oscilloscope input resistance is 10 megohms when the probe
is used. Thus, using the attenuator probe with the oscilloscope causes less circuit loading than using a 1-
to-1 probe.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before using an attenuator probe for measurement of high-frequency signals or for fast-rising
waveforms, you must adjust the probe compensating capacitor (C1) according to instructions in the
applicable technical manual. Some probes will have an IMPEDANCE EQUALIZER in the end of the
cable that attaches to the oscilloscope. The impedance equalizer, when adjusted according to
manufacturer’s instructions, assures proper impedance matching between the probe and oscilloscope. An
improperly adjusted impedance equalizer will result in erroneous measurements, especially when you are
measuring high frequencies or fast-rising signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">More information on oscilloscope hook-ups can be found in Electronics Information Maintenance
Books (EIMB), Test Methods and Practices.
</p><p class="paragraph">Special current probes have been designed to use the electromagnetic fields produced by a current as
it travels through a conductor. This type of probe is clamped around a conductor without disconnecting it
from the circuit. The current probe is electrically insulated from the conductor, but the magnetic fields
about the conductor induce a potential in the current probe that is proportional to the current through the
conductor. Thus, the vertical deflection of the oscilloscope display will be directly proportional to the
current through the conductor.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The spectrum analyzer is used to examine the frequency spectrum of radar transmissions, local
oscillators, test sets, and any other equipment operating within its testable frequency range. With
experience, you will be able to determine definite areas of malfunctioning components within equipment.
Successful spectrum analysis depends on the proper operation of a spectrum analyzer and your ability to
correctly interpret the displayed frequencies. Although there are many types of spectrum analyzers, we
will use the Tektronix, Model 492 for our discussion.
</p><p class="paragraph">The spectrum analyzer accepts an electrical input signal and displays the frequency and amplitude of
the signal on a CRT. On the vertical, or Y, axis, the amplitude is plotted. The frequency would then be
found on the horizontal, or X, axis. The overall pattern of this display (figure 6-42) indicates the
proportion of power present at the various frequencies within the spectrum (fundamental frequency with
sideband frequencies).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BASIC-FUNCTIONAL-DESCRIPTION-6-38-">BASIC FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
</h2><p class="paragraph">The model 492 analyzer can be divided into six basic sections, as follows:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Converter section;
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Intermediate frequency (IF) section;
• Display section;
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Frequency control section;
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Digital control section; and
</h3><p class="paragraph">• Power and cooling section.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Converter Section
</h3><p class="paragraph">The converter section actually consists of three frequency converters, made up of a mixer, local
oscillator (LO), and required filters. Only one frequency can be converted at a time and pass through the
filters to reach the next converter. The analysis frequency can, however, be changed by altering the
frequency of the LO and adjusting the FREQUENCY control knob.
</p><p class="paragraph">FIRST CONVERTER.—The first (front end) converter changes the input signal to a usable IF
signal that will either be 829 MHz or 2072 MHz. The IF signal to be produced is dependent on which
measurement band selection is currently being used. The 829 MHz IF signal will be selected for bands 2
through 4, while the 2072 MHz IF signal is selected for bands 1 and 5 through 11.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-18. The first converter is also known by what other name?</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">6-39
</p><p class="paragraph">SECOND CONVERTER.—The second converter actually contains two converters. Only one of
these two converters in this section is ever operational, and selected as a result of the measurement band
currently being used. The selected converter will convert the frequency received from the first converter
to a usable (110 MHz) IF signal, which is then provided to the third converter.
</p><p class="paragraph">THIRD CONVERTER.—This converter takes the 110 MHz IF signal, amplifies it, and then
converts it to the final IF of 10 MHz. This signal, in turn, is then passed on to the IF section.
</p><h3 class="subsection">IF Section
</h3><p class="paragraph">The IF section receives the final IF signal and uses it to establish the system resolution by using
selective filtering. System resolution is selected under microcomputer control among five bandwidths (1
MHz, 100 kHz, 10 kHz, 1 kHz, and 100 Hz). The gain for all bands are then leveled and logarithmically
amplified. This is done so that each division of signal change on the CRT display remains equal in change
to every other division on the CRT. For example, in the 10-dB-per-division mode, each division of
change is equal to a 10 dB difference, regardless of whether the signal appears at the top or bottom of the
CRT. The signal needed to produce the video output to the display section is then detected and provided.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Display Section
</h3><p class="paragraph">The display section provides a representative display of the input signal on the CRT. It accomplishes
this by performing the following functions:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Receives the video signals from the IF section and processes these signals to adjust the vertical
drive of the CRT;
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Receives the sweep voltages and processes these signals to produce the horizontal CRT drive
plate voltage;
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Receives character data information and generates CRT plate drive signals to display alpha and
numeric characters on the CRT;
</h3><p class="paragraph">• Receives control levels from the front panel beam controls and generates unblanking signals to
control display presence, brightness, and focus.
</p><p class="paragraph">The vertical deflection of the beam is increased as the output of the amplitude detector increases. The
horizontal position is controlled by the frequency control section and is the frequency analyzed at that
instant. The beam sweeps from left to right, low to high frequencies during its analysis. During this
analysis, any time a signal is discovered, a vertical deflection will show the strength of the signal at the
horizontal position that is the frequency. This results in a display of amplitude as a function of frequency.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Frequency Control Section
</h3><p class="paragraph">The frequency control section accomplishes the tuning of the first and second LOs within the
converter section. The frequency immediately being analyzed is controlled by the current frequencies of
the LOs. To analyze another frequency, you must change an LO frequency to allow the new frequency to
be converted to a 10 MHz signal by the converter section. Periodically, the unit sweeps and analyzes a
frequency range centered on the frequency set by the FREQUENCY knob. Adjusting the FREQUENCY
knob will cause the LOs to be tuned to the new frequency. Only the LOs of the first two converters can be
changed to vary the frequency being analyzed.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

control to any section of the analyzer.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Power and Cooling Section
</h3><p class="paragraph">The main power supply provides almost all the regulated voltages required to operate the unit. The
display section provides the high voltage necessary for CRT operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">The cooling system allows fresh cool air to be routed to all sections of the unit in proportion to the
heat that is generated by each section.
</p><h3 class="subsection">SPECTRUM ANALYZER FRONT PANEL CONTROLS, INDICATORS, AND CONNECTORS
</h3><p class="paragraph">This section will describe the function of the front panel controls, indicators, and connectors. For a
complete description of each function, refer to table 6-1 while reviewing the front panel in figure 6-43.
The numbers located in column 1 of table 6-1 equate to the same numbers found on the front panel of

and 50 volt peak.
</p><p class="paragraph">6 SINGLE SWEEP This push button, plus a ready indicator (No. 7), provides the single sweep
operation. When this operation is selected, one sweep is initiated after the sweep
circuit has been triggered. Pushing this button does not cancel the other trigger
modes. When single sweep is first selected, the present sweep is aborted, but the
sweep circuit is not yet armed. An additional push is required to initially arm the
sweep. The button must be pushed again to rearm the sweep circuit each time the
sweep has run. To cancel single sweep, you must select one of the four trigger
mode selections.

accomplished, you should deactivate the CAL mode.
</p><p class="paragraph">14 DEGAUSS When this button is pressed, current through the local oscillator system is reduced
to zero in order to minimize magnetism build-up around the LOs. This is done to
enhance the center frequency display and amplitude accuracy. You should do this
after every significant frequency change and before calibrating the center
frequency.
</p><h3 class="subsection">15 IDENTIFY 500 kHz
ONLY
</h3><p class="paragraph">The signal identify feature can become functional only when the FREQ SPAN/DIV
is set to 500 kHz. When activated (button lit), true signals will change in amplitude
on every sweep. Images and spurious response signals will shift horizontally or go
completely off the CRT display. To ensure that the signal is changing amplitude
every sweep, you should decrease the sweep rate so that each sweep can be
analyzed.
</p><p class="paragraph">16 PHASE LOCK When this control is activated (button lit), it will reduce residual FM when narrow
spans are selected. In narrow spans, the phase lock can be turned off or back on by
pressing the button. Switching the PHASE LOCK off may cause the signal to shift
position. In narrow spans, the signal could shift off the display; however, it will
usually return to its phase locked position after a few moments. The
microcomputer automatically selects PHASE LOCK for a span/division of 50 kHz
or below in bands 1 through 3, 100 kHz or below for band 3, and 200 kHz for
bands 5 and above.

</p><p class="paragraph">A CATHODE-RAY TUBE (CRT) is used in an oscilloscope to display the waveforms.
The CRT used in oscilloscopes consists of an ELECTRON GUN, a DEFLECTION SYSTEM,
</p><p class="paragraph">and a FLUORESCENT SCREEN.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ELECTRON BEAM in an oscilloscope is allowed to be controlled in any direction by means
of HORIZONTAL- and VERTICAL-DEFLECTION PLATES.
</p><p class="paragraph">VERTICAL-DEFLECTION PLATES are used to show AMPLITUDE of a signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">HORIZONTAL-DEFLECTION PLATES are used to show TIME and/or FREQUENCY
relationship.
</p><p class="paragraph">A GRATICULE is a calibrated scale of AMPLITUDE VERSUS TIME that is placed on the face
of the CRT.
</p><p class="paragraph">A DUAL-TRACE OSCILLOSCOPE is designed to accept two vertical inputs at the same time. It
uses a single beam of electrons shared by two channels.
</p><p class="paragraph">The SPECTRUM ANALYZER accepts an electrical input signal and displays the signal’s
frequency and amplitude on a CRT display.
</p><p class="paragraph">ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS Q1. THROUGH Q18.
 A-1. Control grid.
</p><p class="paragraph"> A-2. The first anode.
