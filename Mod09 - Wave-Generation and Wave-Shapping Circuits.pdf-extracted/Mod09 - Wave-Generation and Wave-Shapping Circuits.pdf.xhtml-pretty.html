SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current

</h2><p class="paragraph">When your radio or television set is turned on, many events take place within the "receiver" before 
you hear the sound or see the picture being sent by the transmitting station. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Many different signals reach the antenna of a radio receiver at the same time. To select a station, the 
listener adjusts the tuning dial on the radio receiver until the desired station is heard. Within the radio or 
TV receiver, the actual "selecting" of the desired signal and the rejecting of the unwanted signals are 
accomplished by what is called a TUNED CIRCUIT. A tuned circuit consists of a coil and a capacitor 
connected in series or parallel. Later in this chapter you will see the application and advantages of both 
series- and parallel-tuned circuits. Whenever the characteristics of inductance and capacitance are found 
in a tuned circuit, the phenomenon as RESONANCE takes place. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You learned earlier in the Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series, Module 2, chapter 4, that 
inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive reactance (XC) have opposite effects on circuit impedance (Z). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">If you realize that XL and XC can be equal ONLY at ONE FREQUENCY (the resonant frequency), 
then you will have learned the most important single fact about resonant circuits. This fact is the principle 
that enables tuned circuits in the radio receiver to select one particular frequency and reject all others. 
This is the reason why so much emphasis is placed on XL and X C in the discussions that follow. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Examine figure 1-1. Notice that a basic tuned circuit consists of a coil and a capacitor, connected 
either in series, view (A), or in parallel, view (B). The resistance (R) in the circuit is usually limited to the 
inherent resistance of the components (particularly the resistance of the coil). For our purposes we are 
going to disregard this small resistance in future diagrams and explanations.

chapter in module 2 of the NEETS.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Perhaps the most often used control of a radio or television set is the station or channel selector. Of 
course, the volume, tone, and picture quality controls are adjusted to suit the individual's taste, but very 
often they are not adjusted when the station is changed. What goes on behind this station selecting? In this 
chapter, you will learn the basic principles that account for the ability of circuits to "tune" to the desired 
station.  
</p><h3 class="subsection">Effect of Frequency on Inductive Reactance 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In an a.c. circuit, an inductor produces inductive reactance which causes the current to lag the 
voltage by 90 degrees. Because the inductor "reacts" to a changing current, it is known as a reactive 
component. The opposition that an inductor presents to a.c. is called inductive reactance (X L). This 
opposition is caused by the inductor "reacting" to the changing current of the a.c. source. Both the 
inductance and the frequency determine the magnitude of this reactance. This relationship is stated by the 
formula:  
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As shown in the equation, any increase in frequency, or "f," will cause a corresponding increase of 
inductive reactance, or "XL." Therefore, the INDUCTIVE REACTANCE VARIES DIRECTLY WITH 
THE FREQUENCY. As you can see, the higher the frequency, the greater the inductive reactance; the 
lower the frequency, the less the inductive reactance for a given inductor. This relationship is illustrated in 
figure 1-2. Increasing values of XL are plotted in terms of increasing frequency. Starting at the lower left 
corner with zero frequency, the inductive reactance is zero. As the frequency is increased (reading to the 
right), the inductive reactance is shown to increase in direct proportion. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Effect of Frequency on Capacitive Reactance 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In an a.c. circuit, a capacitor produces a reactance which causes the current to lead the voltage by 90 
degrees. Because the capacitor "reacts" to a changing voltage, it is known as a reactive component. The 
opposition a capacitor presents to a.c. is called capacitive reactance (XC). The opposition is caused by the 
capacitor "reacting" to the changing voltage of the a.c. source. The formula for capacitive reactance is:

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">In contrast to the inductive reactance, this equation indicates that the CAPACITIVE REACTANCE 
VARIES INVERSELY WITH THE FREQUENCY. When f = 0, XC is infinite (∞) and decreases as 
frequency increases. That is, the lower the frequency, the greater the capacitive reactance; the higher the 
frequency, the less the reactance for a given capacitor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As shown in figure 1-3, the effect of capacitance is opposite to that of inductance. Remember, 
capacitance causes the current to lead the voltage by 90 degrees, while inductance causes the current to 
lag the voltage by 90 degrees. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

already explained. So far, nothing has been said about the effect of frequency on resistance. In an Ohm's 
law relationship, such as R = E/I no "f" is involved. Thus, for all practical purposes, a change of 
frequency does not affect the resistance of the circuit. If a 60-hertz a.c. voltage causes 20 milliamperes of 
current in a resistive circuit, then the same voltage at 2000 hertz, for example, would still cause 20 
milliamperes to flow. 
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: Remember that the total opposition to a.c. is called impedance (Z). Impedance is the 
combination of inductive reactance (XL), capacitive reactance (XC), and resistance (R). When dealing 
with a.c. circuits, the impedance is the factor with which you will ultimately be concerned. But, as you 
have just been shown, the resistance (R) is not affected by frequency. Therefore, the remainder of the 
discussion of a.c. circuits will only be concerned with the reactance of inductors and capacitors and will 
ignore resistance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A.c. Circuits Containing Both Inductive and Capacitive Reactances 
</p><p class="paragraph">A.c. circuits that contain both an inductor and a capacitor have interesting characteristics because of 
the opposing effects of L and C. X L and XC may be treated as reactors which are 180 degrees out of 
phase. As shown in figure 1-2, the vector for XL should be plotted above the baseline; vector for XC, 
figure 1-3, should be plotted below the baseline. In a series circuit, the effective reactance, or what is 
termed the RESULTANT REACTANCE, is the difference between the individual reactances. As an 
equation, the resultant reactance is: </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

difference is: X = XL − XC = 1200 − 4000 = −2800 ohms (capacitive). The total carries the sign (+ or −) of 
the greater number (factor). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-1. What is the relationship between frequency and the values of (a) XL, (b) XC, and (c) R? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-2. In an a.c. circuit that contains both an inductor and a capacitor, what term is used for the 
difference between the individual reactances? 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RESONANCE-1-6-">RESONANCE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">For every combination of L and C, there is only ONE frequency (in both series and parallel circuits) 
that causes XL to exactly equal XC; this frequency is known as the RESONANT FREQUENCY. When 
the resonant frequency is fed to a series or parallel circuit, X L becomes equal to XC, and the circuit is said 
to be RESONANT to that frequency. The circuit is now called a RESONANT CIRCUIT; resonant 
circuits are tuned circuits. The circuit condition wherein XL becomes equal to XC is known as 
RESONANCE. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each LCR circuit responds to resonant frequency differently than it does to any other frequency. 
Because of this, an LCR circuit has the ability to separate frequencies. For example, suppose the TV or 
radio station you want to see or hear is broadcasting at the resonant frequency. The LC "tuner" in your set 
can divide the frequencies, picking out the resonant frequency and rejecting the other frequencies. Thus, 
the tuner selects the station you want and rejects all other stations. If you decide to select another station, 
you can change the frequency by tuning the resonant circuit to the desired frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RESONANT-FREQUENCY-1-6-">RESONANT FREQUENCY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">As stated before, the frequency at which XL equals XC (in a given circuit) is known as the resonant 
frequency of that circuit. Based on this, the following formula has been derived to find the exact resonant 
frequency when the values of circuit components are known: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two important points to remember about this formula. First, the resonant frequency found 
when using the formula will cause the reactances (XL and XC) of the L and C components to be equal. 
Second, any change in the value of either L or C will cause a change in the resonant frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An increase in the value of either L or C, or both L and C, will lower the resonant frequency of a 
given circuit. A decrease in the value of L or C, or both L and C, will raise the resonant frequency of a 
given circuit. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

this point, and ONLY this point, XL equals XC. Therefore, the frequency indicated by fr is the one and 
only frequency of resonance. Note the resistance symbol which indicates that at resonance all reactance is 
cancelled and the circuit impedance is effectively purely resistive. Remember, a.c. circuits that are 
resistive have no phase shift between voltage and current. Therefore, at resonance, phase shift is 
cancelled. The phase angle is effectively zero. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Second, look at the area of the curves to the left of fr. This area shows the relative reactances of the 
circuit at frequencies BELOW resonance. To these LOWER frequencies, XC will always be greater than 
XL. There will always be some capacitive reactance left in the circuit after all inductive reactance has

state that below fr the circuit will appear capacitive.

applying the formulas you have learned, you know that a lower frequency produces a higher capacitive 
reactance and a lower inductive reactance. The reactances subtract but do not cancel (X L − XC = 1260 − 
5300 = 4040 ohms (capacitive)). At an input frequency of 100 kHz, the circuit (still resonant to 205 kHz) 
has a net reactance of 4040 ohms. In our theoretically perfect circuit, the total opposition (Z) is equal to 
X, or 4040 ohms.

</h3><p class="paragraph">As you learned much earlier in this series, resistance is always present in practical electrical circuits; 
it is impossible to eliminate. A typical series-LC circuit, then, has R as well as L and C. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If our perfect (ideal) circuit has zero resistance, and a typical circuit has "some" resistance, then a 
circuit with a very small resistance is closer to being perfect than one that has a large resistance. Let's list 
what happens in a series-resonant circuit because resistance is present. This is not new to you - just a 
review of what you have learned previously. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In a series-resonant circuit that is basically L and C, but that contains "some" R, the following 
statements are true: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• XL, XC, and R components are all present and can be shown on a vector diagram, each at right 
angles with the resistance vector (baseline). 
</p><p class="paragraph">• At resonance, the resultant reactance is zero ohms. Thus, at resonance, The circuit impedance 
equals only the resistance (R). The circuit impedance can never be less than R because the 
original resistance will always be present in the circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• At resonance, a practical series-RLC circuit ALWAYS has MINIMUM impedance. The actual 
value of impedance is that of the resistance present in the circuit (Z = R). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, if the designers do their very best (and they do) to keep the value of resistance in a practical 
series-RLC circuit LOW, then we can still get a fairly high current at resonance. The current is NOT 
"infinitely" high as in our ideal circuit, but is still higher than at any other frequency. The curve and 
vector relationships for the practical circuit are shown in figure 1-7. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

resistance allows narrower bandwidth, which is the same as saying the circuit has better selectivity.

</p><h3 class="subsection">How the Parallel-LC Circuit Stores Energy 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A parallel-LC circuit is often called a TANK CIRCUIT because it can store energy much as a tank 
stores liquid. It has the ability to take energy fed to it from a power source, store this energy alternately in 
the inductor and capacitor, and produce an output which is a continuous a.c. wave. You can understand 
how this is accomplished by carefully studying the sequence of events shown in figure 1-8. You must 
thoroughly understand the capacitor and inductor action in this figure before you proceed further in the 
study of parallel-resonant circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In each view of figure 1-8, the waveform is of the charging and discharging CAPACITOR 
VOLTAGE. In view (A), the switch has been moved to position C. The d.c. voltage is applied across the 
capacitor, and the capacitor charges to the potential of the battery. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">In view (B), moving the switch to the right completes the circuit from the capacitor to the inductor 
and places the inductor in series with the capacitor. This furnishes a path for the excess electrons on the 
upper plate of the capacitor to flow to the lower plate, and thus starts neutralizing the capacitor charge. As 
these electrons flow through the coil, a magnetic field is built up around the coil. The energy which was 
first stored by the electrostatic field of the capacitor is now stored in the electromagnetic field of the 
inductor.

</p><p class="paragraph">If it were possible to have a circuit with absolutely no resistance, there would be no heat loss, and the 
oscillations would tend to continue indefinitely. You have already learned that tuned circuits are designed 
to have very little resistance. Reducing I2R losses is still another reason for having low resistance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A "perfect" tuned circuit would produce the continuous sine wave shown in figure 1-10. Its

</p><p class="paragraph">The reasons why the circuit in figure 1-8 oscillates at the resonant frequency have to do with the 
characteristics of resonant circuits. The discussion of parallel resonance will not be as detailed as that for

The first of these characteristics is the ability to store energy. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Characteristics of a Typical Parallel-Resonant Circuit 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Look at figure 1-11. In this circuit, as in other parallel circuits, the voltage is the same across the 
inductor and capacitor. The currents through the components vary inversely with their reactances in 
accordance with Ohm's law. The total current drawn by the circuit is the vector sum of the two individual 
component currents. Finally, these two currents, IL and IC, are 180 degrees out of phase because the 
effects of L and C are opposite. There is not a single fact new to you in the above. It is all based on what 
you have learned previously about parallel a.c. circuits that contain L and C. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, at resonance, XL is still equal to X C. Therefore, IL must equal IC. Remember, the voltage is the 
same; the reactances are equal; therefore, according to Ohm's law, the currents must be equal. But, don't 
forget, even though the currents are equal, they are still opposites. That is, if the current is flowing "up" in 
the capacitor, it is flowing "down" in the coil, and vice versa. In effect, while the one component draws 
current, the other returns it to the source. The net effect of this "give and take action" is that zero current 
is drawn from the source at resonance. The two currents yield a total current of zero amperes because they 
are exactly equal and opposite at resonance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A circuit that is completed and has a voltage applied, but has zero current, must have an INFINITE 
IMPEDANCE (apply Ohm's law — any voltage divided by zero yields infinity). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">By now you know that we have just ignored our old friend resistance from previous discussions. In 
an actual circuit, at resonance, the currents will not quite counteract each other because each component 
will have different resistance. This resistance is kept extremely low, but it is still there. The result is that a 
relatively small current flows from the source at resonance instead of zero current. Therefore, a basic 
characteristic of a practical parallel-LC circuit is that, at resonance, the circuit has MAXIMUM 
impedance which results in MINIMUM current from the source. This current is often called line current. 
This is shown by the peak of the waveform for impedance and the valley for the line current, both 
occurring at fr the frequency of resonance in figure 1-11. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There is little difference between the circuit pulsed by the battery in figure 1-8 that oscillated at its 
resonant (or natural) frequency, and the circuit we have just discussed. The equal and opposite currents in 
the two components are the same as the currents that charged and discharged the capacitor through the 
coil. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For a given source voltage, the current oscillating between the reactive parts will be stronger at the 
resonant frequency of the circuit than at any other frequency. At frequencies below resonance, capacitive 
current will decrease; above the resonant frequency, inductive current will decrease. Therefore, the 
oscillating current (or circulating current, as it is sometimes called), being the lesser of the two reactive 
currents, will be maximum at resonance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you remember, the basic resonant circuit produced a "damped" wave. A steady amplitude wave 
was produced by giving the circuit energy that would keep it going. To do this, the energy had to be at the 
same frequency as the resonant frequency of the circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">So, if the resonant frequency is "timed" right, then all other frequencies are "out of time" and 
produce waves that tend to buck each other. Such frequencies cannot produce strong oscillating currents. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In our typical parallel-resonant (LC) circuit, the line current is minimum (because the impedance is 
maximum). At the same time, the internal oscillating current in the tank is maximum. Oscillating current 
may be several hundred times as great as line current at resonance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In any case, this circuit reacts differently to the resonant frequency than it does to all other 
frequencies. This makes it an effective frequency selector. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Summary of Resonance 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Both series- and parallel-LC circuits discriminate between the resonant frequency and all other 
frequencies by balancing an inductive reactance against an equal capacitive reactance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In series, these reactances create a very low impedance. In parallel, they create a very high 
impedance. These characteristics govern how and where designers use resonant circuits. A low-
impedance requirement would require a series-resonant circuit. A high-impedance requirement would 
require the designer to use a parallel-resonant circuit. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tuning a Band of Frequencies 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Our resonant circuits so far have been tuned to a single frequency - the resonant frequency. This is 
fine if only one frequency is required. However, there are hundreds of stations on many different 
frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, if we go back to our original application, that of tuning to different radio stations, our 
resonant circuits are not practical. The reason is because a tuner for each frequency would be required and 
this is not practical. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The principle of series- or parallel-resonant circuits have many applications in radio, television, 
communications, and the various other electronic fields throughout the Navy. As you have seen, by 
making the capacitance or inductance variable, the frequency at which a circuit will resonate can be 
controlled. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to station selecting or tuning, resonant circuits can separate currents of certain 
frequencies from those of other frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Circuits in which resonant circuits are used to do this are called FILTER CIRCUITS. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If we can select the proper values of resistors, inductors, or capacitors, a FILTER NETWORK, or 
"frequency selector," can be produced which offers little opposition to one frequency, while BLOCKING 
or ATTENUATING other frequencies. A filter network can also be designed that will "pass" a band of 
frequencies and "reject" all other frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most electronic circuits require the use of filters in one form or another. You have already studied 
several in modules 6, 7, and 8 of the NEETS. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One example of a filter being applied is in a rectifier circuit. As you know, an alternating voltage is 
changed by the rectifier to a direct current. However, the d.c. voltage is not pure; it is still pulsating and 
fluctuating. In other words, the signal still has an a.c. component in addition to the d.c. voltage. By 
feeding the signal through simple filter networks, the a.c. component is reduced. The remaining d.c. is as 
pure as the designers require. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Bypass capacitors, which you have already studied, are part of filter networks that, in effect, bypass, 
or shunt, unwanted a.c. components to ground.

was better than high resistance. Now you will learn about a factor that, in effect, measures just how close 
to perfect a tuner or tuner component can be. This same factor affects BANDWIDTH and 
SELECTIVITY. It can be used in figuring voltage across a coil or capacitor in a series-resonant circuit 
and the amount of circulating (tank) current in a parallel-resonant circuit. This factor is very important </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

things. The factor is known as Q. Some say it stands for quality (or merit). The higher the Q, the better the 
circuit; the lower the losses (I2R), the closer the circuit is to being perfect. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Having studied the first part of this chapter, you should not be surprised to learn that resistance (R) 
has a great effect on this figure of merit or quality. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Q Is a Ratio 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Q is really very simple to understand if you think back to the tuned-circuit principles just covered. 
Inductance and capacitance are in all tuners. Resistance is an impurity that causes losses. Therefore, 
components that provide the reactance with a minimum of resistance are "purer" (more perfect) than those 
with higher resistance. The actual measure of this purity, merit, or quality must include the two basic 
quantities, X and R. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The ratio 
</h3><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">does the job for us. Let's take a look at it and see just why it measures quality. 
</p><p class="paragraph">First, if a perfect circuit has zero resistance, then our ratio should give a very high value of Q to 
reflect the high quality of the circuit. Does it? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume any value for X and a zero value for R. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Then: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember, any value divided by zero equals infinity. Thus, our ratio is infinitely high for a 
theoretically perfect circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With components of higher resistance, the Q is reduced. Dividing by a larger number always yields a 
smaller quantity. Thus, lower quality components produce a lower Q. Q, then, is a direct and accurate 
measure of the quality of an LC circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q is just a ratio. It is always just a number — no units. The higher the number, the "better" the 
circuit. Later as you get into more practical circuits, you may find that low Q may be desirable to provide 
certain characteristics. For now, consider that higher is better. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because capacitors have much, much less resistance in them than inductors, the Q of a circuit is very 
often expressed as the Q of the coil or: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The answer you get from using this formula is very near correct for most purposes. Basically, the Q 
of a capacitor is so high that it does not limit the Q of the circuit in any practical way. For that reason, the 
technician may ignore it. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">The Q of a Coil 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Q is a feature that is designed into a coil. When the coil is used within the frequency range for which 
it is designed, Q is relatively constant. In this sense, it is a physical characteristic. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Inductance is a result of the physical makeup of a coil - number of turns, core, type of winding, etc. 
Inductance governs reactance at a given frequency. Resistance is inherent in the length, size, and material 
of the wire. Therefore, the Q of a coil is mostly dependent on physical characteristics. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Values of Q that are in the hundreds are very practical and often found in typical equipment. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Application of Q 
</h3><p class="paragraph">For the most part, Q is the concern of designers, not technicians. Therefore, the chances of you 
having to figure the Q of a coil are remote. However, it is important for you to know some circuit 
relationships that are affected by Q. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Q Relationships in Series Circuits 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Q can be used to determine the "gain" of series-resonant circuits. Gain refers to the fact that at 
resonance, the voltage drop across the reactances are greater than the applied voltage. Remember, when 
we applied Ohm's law in a series-resonant circuit, it gave us the following characteristics: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Low impedance, high current. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• High current; high voltage across the comparatively high reactances. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This high voltage is usable where little power is required, such as in driving the grid of a vacuum 
tube or the gate of a field effect transistor (F.E.T.). The gain of a properly designed series-resonant circuit 
may be as great or greater than the amplification within the amplifier itself. The gain is a function of Q, as 
shown in the following example: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the Q of the coil were 100, then the gain would be 100; that is, the voltage of the coil would be 100 
times that of the input voltage to the series circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Resistance affects the resonance curve of a series circuit in two ways — the lower the resistance, the 
higher the current; also, the lower the resistance, the sharper the curve. Because low resistance causes 
high Q, these two facts are usually expressed as functions of Q. That is, the higher the Q, the higher and 
sharper the curve and the more selective the circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The lower the Q (because of higher resistance), the lower the current curve; therefore, the broader 
the curve, the less selective the circuit. A summary of the major characteristics of series RLC-circuits at 
resonance is given in table 1-1. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

parallel circuit. However, Q helps give us a measure of the current that circulates in the tank. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Again, if the Q were 100, the circulating current would be 100 times the value of the line current. 
This may help explain why some of the wire sizes are very large in high-power amplifying circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The impedance curve of a parallel-resonant circuit is also affected by the Q of the circuit in a manner 
similar to the current curve of a series circuit. The Q of the circuit determines how much the impedance is 
increased across the parallel-LC circuit. (Z = Q × XL) 
</p><p class="paragraph">The higher the Q, the greater the impedance at resonance and the sharper the curve. The lower the Q, 
the lower impedance at resonance; therefore, the broader the curve, the less selective the circuit. The

Basically, the value of Q is an inverse function of electrical power dissipated through circuit resistance. Q 
is the ratio of the power stored in the reactive components to the power dissipated in the resistance. That 
is, high power loss is low Q; low power loss is high Q.

discriminate sharply (reject the unwanted frequencies) between the resonant frequency and the 
frequencies on either side of resonance, as shown by the curve in figure 1-12, view (A). The range of 
frequencies included between the two frequencies (426.4 kHz and 483.6 kHz in this example) at which

</h2><p class="paragraph">In many practical applications of complex circuits, various combinations of direct, low-frequency, 
audio-frequency, and radio-frequency currents may exist. It is frequently necessary to have a means for 
separating these component currents at any desired point. An electrical device for accomplishing this 
separation is called a FILTER. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A filter circuit consists of inductance, capacitance, and resistance used singularly or in combination, 
depending upon the purpose. It may be designed so that it will separate alternating current from direct 
current, or so that it will separate alternating current of one frequency (or a band of frequencies) from 
other alternating currents of different frequencies. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The use of resistance by itself in filter circuits does not provide any filtering action, because it 
opposes the flow of any current regardless of its frequency. What it does, when connected in series or 
parallel with an inductor or capacitor, is to decrease the "sharpness," or selectivity, of the filter. Hence, in 
some particular application, resistance might be used in conjunction with inductance or capacitance to 
provide filtering action over a wider band of frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Filter circuits may be divided into four general types: LOW-PASS, HIGH-PASS, BANDPASS, 
AND BAND-REJECT filters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Electronic circuits often have currents of different frequencies. The reason is that a source produces 
current with the same frequency as the applied voltage. As an example, the a.c. signal input to an audio 
amplifier can have high- and low-audio frequencies; the input to an rf amplifier can have a wide range of 
radio frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In such applications where the current has different frequency components, it is usually necessary for 
the filter either to accept or reject one frequency or a group of frequencies. The electronic filter that can 
pass on the higher-frequency components to a load or to the next circuit is known as a HIGH-PASS filter. 
A LOW-PASS filter can be used to pass on lower-frequency components. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before discussing filters further, we will review and apply some basic principles of the frequency-
response characteristics of the capacitor and the inductor. Recall the basic formula for capacitive 
reactance and inductive reactance: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume any given value of L and C. If we increase the applied frequency, XC decreases and XL 
increases. If we increase the frequency enough, the capacitor acts as a short and the inductor acts as an 
open. Of course, the opposite is also true. Decreasing frequency causes XC to increase and XL to decrease. 
Here again, if we make a large enough change, XC acts as an open and XL acts as a short. Figure 1-13 
gives a pictorial representation of these two basic components and how they respond to low and high 
frequencies.

easy to see how the various components will react in different configurations with a change in frequency.

figure 1-17. A capacitor that is used in series with the source of both high and low frequencies, as shown 
in view (A) of figure 1-18, will respond differently to high-frequency, low-frequency, and direct currents. 
It will offer little opposition to the passage of high-frequency currents, great opposition to the passage of 
low-frequency currents, and completely block direct currents. The value of the capacitor must be chosen 
so that it allows the passage of all currents having frequencies above the desired value, and opposes those 
having frequencies below the desired value. Then, in order to shunt the undesired low-frequency currents 
back to the source, an inductor is used, as shown in view (B). This inductor must have a value that will 
allow it to pass currents having frequencies below the frequency cutoff point, and reject currents having 
frequencies above the frequency cutoff point, thus forcing them to pass through the capacitor. By 
combining inductance and capacitance, as shown in view (C), you obtain the simplest type of high-pass 
filter. At point P most of the high-frequency energy is passed on to the load by the capacitor, and most of 
the low-frequency energy is shunted back to the source through the inductor.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Resonant circuits can be made to serve as filters in a manner similar to the action of individual 
capacitors and inductors. As you know, the series-LC circuit offers minimum opposition to currents that 
have frequencies at or near the resonant frequency, and maximum opposition to currents of all other 
frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You also know that a parallel-LC circuit offers a very high impedance to currents that have 
frequencies at or near the resonant frequency, and a relatively low impedance to currents of all other 
frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you use these two basic concepts, the BANDPASS and BAND-REJECT filters can be constructed. 
The bandpass filter and the band-reject filter are two common types of filters that use resonant circuits. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Bandpass Filter 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A bandpass filter passes a narrow band of frequencies through a circuit and attenuates all other 
frequencies that are higher or lower than the desired band of frequencies. This is shown in figure 1-19 
where the greatest current exists at the center frequency (fr). Frequencies below resonance (f1) and 
frequencies above resonance (f2) drop off rapidly and are rejected. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

frequency, and opposes the passage of all currents having frequencies outside this band.

for all currents having frequencies outside the limits of the frequency band passed by the series-resonant 
circuit. The simplest type of bandpass filter is formed by connecting the two LC circuits as shown in 
figure 1-20, view (C). The upper and lower frequency limits of the filter action are filter cutoff points.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Band-Reject Filter 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A band-reject filter circuit is used to block the passage of current for a narrow band of frequencies, 
while allowing current to flow at all frequencies above or below this band. This type of filter is also 
known as a BAND-SUPPRESSION or BAND-STOP filter. The way it responds is shown by the response 
curve of figure 1-21. Since the purpose of the band-reject filter is directly opposite to that of a bandpass 
filter, the relative positions of the resonant circuits in the filter are interchanged. The parallel-LC circuit 
shown in figure 1-22, view (A), replaces the capacitor of figure 1-18, view (A). It acts as a band-reject 
filter, blocking the passage of currents having frequencies at or near resonant frequency and passing all 
currents having frequencies outside this band. The series-LC circuit shown in figure 1-22, view (B), 
replaces the inductor of figure 1-18, view (B). If this series circuit is tuned, to the same frequency as the 
parallel circuit, it acts as a bypass for the band of rejected frequencies. Then, the simplest type of band-
reject filter is obtained by connecting the two circuits as shown in figure 1-22, view (C).

</h2><p class="paragraph">All of the various types of filters we have discussed so far have had only one section. In many cases, 
the use of such simple filter circuits does not provide sufficiently sharp cutoff points. But by adding a 
capacitor, an inductor, or a resonant circuit in series or in parallel (depending upon the type of filter action 
required), the ideal effect is more nearly approached. When such additional units are added to a filter 
circuit, the form of the resulting circuit will resemble the letter T, or the Greek letter pi (pi). They are, 
therefore, called T- or pi-type filters, depending upon which symbol they resemble. Two or more T- or 
pi−type filters may be connected together to produce a still sharper cutoff point. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-23, (view A) (view B) and (view C), and figure 1-24, (view A) (view B) and (view C) 
depict some of the common configurations of the T- and pi-type filters. Further discussion about the 
theory of operation of these circuits is beyond the intended scope of this module. If you are interested in 
learning more about filters, a good source of information to study is the Electronics Installation and 
Maintenance Handbook (EIMB), section 4 (Electronics Circuits), NAVSEA 0967-LP-000-0120.

</p><p class="paragraph">RESULTANT REACTANCE X = (XL − X C) or X = (XC − XL). XL is usually plotted above the 
reference line and X C below the reference line. Inductance and capacitance have opposite effects on the 
current in respect to the voltage in a.c. circuits. Below resonance, XC is larger than XL, and the series 
circuit appears capacitive. Above resonance, XL is larger than XC, and the series circuit appears inductive. 
At resonance, XL = XC, and the total impedance of the circuit is resistive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A RESONANT CIRCUIT is often called a TANK CIRCUIT. It has the ability to take energy fed 
from a power source, store the energy alternately in the inductor and capacitor, and produce an output 
which is a continuous a.c. wave. The number of times this set of events occurs per second is called the 
resonant frequency of the circuit. The actual frequency at which a tank circuit will oscillate is determined 
by the formula:

</h2><p class="paragraph">WAVE GENERATORS play a prominent role in the field of electronics. They generate signals from 
a few hertz to several gigahertz (109 hertz). Modern wave generators use many different circuits and 
generate such outputs as SINUSOIDAL, SQUARE, RECTANGULAR, SAWTOOTH, and 
TRAPEZOIDAL waveshapes. These waveshapes serve many useful purposes in the electronic circuits 
you will be studying. For example, they are used extensively throughout the television receiver to 
reproduce both picture and sound. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One type of wave generator is known as an OSCILLATOR. An oscillator can be regarded as an 
amplifier which provides its own input signal. Oscillators are classified according to the waveshapes they 
produce and the requirements needed for them to produce oscillations.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Sinusoidal Oscillators 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A sinusoidal oscillator produces a sine-wave output signal. Ideally, the output signal is of constant 
amplitude with no variation in frequency. Actually, something less than this is usually obtained. The 
degree to which the ideal is approached depends upon such factors as class of amplifier operation, 
amplifier characteristics, frequency stability, and amplitude stability. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Sine-wave generators produce signals ranging from low audio frequencies to ultrahigh radio and 
microwave frequencies. Many low-frequency generators use resistors and capacitors to form their 
frequency-determining networks and are referred to as RC OSCILLATORS. They are widely used in the 
audio-frequency range. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another type of sine-wave generator uses inductors and capacitors for its frequency-determining 
network. This type is known as the LC OSCILLATOR. LC oscillators, which use tank circuits, are 
commonly used for the higher radio frequencies. They are not suitable for use as extremely low-frequency 
oscillators because the inductors and capacitors would be large in size, heavy, and costly to manufacture. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A third type of sine-wave generator is the CRYSTAL-CONTROLLED OSCILLATOR.  The crystal-
controlled oscillator provides excellent frequency stability and is used from the middle of the audio range 
through the radio frequency range. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Nonsinusoidal Oscillators 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Nonsinusoidal oscillators generate complex waveforms, such as square, rectangular, trigger, 
sawtooth, or trapezoidal. Because their outputs are generally characterized by a sudden change, or 
relaxation, they are often referred to as RELAXATION OSCILLATORS. The signal frequency of these 
oscillators is usually governed by the charge or discharge time of a capacitor in series with a resistor. 
Some types, however, contain inductors that affect the output frequency. Thus, like sinusoidal oscillators, 
both RC and LC networks are used for determining the frequency of oscillation. Within this category of 
nonsinusoidal oscillators are MULTIVIBRATORS, BLOCKING OSCILLATORS, SAWTOOTH 
GENERATORS, and TRAPEZOIDAL GENERATORS. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-BASIC-OSCILLATOR-2-2-">THE BASIC OSCILLATOR 
</h2><p class="paragraph">An oscillator can be thought of as an amplifier that provides itself (through feedback) with an input 
signal. By definition, it is a nonrotating device for producing alternating current, the output frequency of 
which is determined by the characteristics of the device. The primary purpose of an oscillator is to 
generate a given waveform at a constant peak amplitude and specific frequency and to maintain this 
waveform within certain limits of amplitude and frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An oscillator must provide amplification. Amplification of signal power occurs from input to output. 
In an oscillator, a portion of the output is fed back to sustain the input, as shown in figure 2-1. Enough 
power must be fed back to the input circuit for the oscillator to drive itself as does a signal generator. To 
cause the oscillator to be self-driven, the feedback signal must also be

</p><p class="paragraph">REGENERATIVE (positive). Regenerative signals must have enough power to compensate for 
circuit losses and to maintain oscillations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since a practical oscillator must oscillate at a predetermined frequency, a FREQUENCY-
DETERMINING DEVICE (fdd), sometimes referred to as a FREQUENCY-DETERMINING 
NETWORK (fdn), is needed. This device acts as a filter, allowing only the desired frequency to pass. 
Without a frequency-determining device, the stage will oscillate in a random manner, and a constant 
frequency will not be maintained. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before discussing oscillators further, let's review the requirements for an oscillator. First, 
amplification is required to provide the necessary gain for the signal. Second, sufficient regenerative 
feedback is required to sustain oscillations. Third, a frequency-determining device is needed to maintain 
the desired output frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic oscillator requirements, in addition to the application, determine the type of oscillator to be 
used. Let's consider some factors that account for the complexity and unique characteristics of oscillators. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Virtually every piece of equipment that uses an oscillator has two stability requirements, 
AMPLITUDE STABILITY and FREQUENCY STABILITY. Amplitude stability refers to the ability of 
the oscillator to maintain a constant amplitude in the output waveform. The more constant the amplitude 
of the output waveform, the better the amplitude stability. Frequency stability refers to the ability of the 
oscillator to maintain its operating frequency. The less the oscillator varies from its operating frequency, 
the better the frequency stability. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A constant frequency and amplitude can be achieved by taking extreme care to prevent variations in 
LOAD, BIAS, and COMPONENT CHARACTERISTICS. Load variations can greatly affect the 
amplitude and frequency stability of the output of an oscillator. Therefore, maintaining the load as 
constant as possible is necessary to ensure a stable output. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As you should know from your study of transistor biasing, bias variations affect the operating point 
of the transistor. These variations may alter the amplification capabilities of the oscillator circuits as well. 
A well-regulated power supply and a bias-stabilizing circuit are required to ensure a constant, uniform 
signal output. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As a result of changing temperature and humidity conditions, the value or characteristics of 
components such as capacitors, resistors, and transistors can change. The changes in these components 
also cause changes in amplitude and frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Output power is another consideration in the use of oscillators. Generally speaking, high power is 
obtained at some sacrifice to stability. When both requirements are to be met, a low-power, stable 
oscillator can be followed by a higher-power BUFFER AMPLIFIER. The buffer provides isolation 
between the oscillator and the load to prevent changes in the load from affecting the oscillator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the oscillator stage must develop high power, efficiency becomes important. Many oscillators use 
class C bias to increase efficiency. Other types of oscillators may use class A bias when a high efficiency 
is not required but distortion must be kept at a minimum. Other classes of bias may also be used with 
certain oscillators.

regenerative feedback is provided. The RC network also acts as the frequency-determining device. View 
(B) shows a vector analysis of the signal E at various points in the circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">To analyze the operation of the circuit in view (A), assume that the amplifier is a common-emitter 
configuration. The signal on the collector (M) is 180 degrees out of phase with the signal (input) on the 
base (R). For the circuit to produce regenerative feedback, the RC network must provide a 180-degree 
phase shift of the collector signal. When power is applied to the circuit, a noise voltage (noise contains 
many different frequencies) will appear on the collector. This noise signal is represented by vector LM in 
view (B). As the signal couples through C1 and across R1 (view (A)), a phase shift occurs. The voltage 
across R1 (E R1), represented by vector LN, has been shifted in phase (about 60 degrees) and reduced in 
amplitude. The signal at point N (view (A)) is then coupled to the next RC section (R2 and C2). Using the 
same size resistor and capacitor as before will cause another 60-degree phase shift to take place. The 
signal at point P is the voltage across R2, represented by vector LP. Now the signal at point P has been 
shifted about 120 degrees and its amplitude is reduced still further. The same actions occur for the last 
section (R3 and C3). This signal experiences another 60-degree phase shift and has further amplitude 
reduction. The signal at point R (ER3) has been shifted 180 degrees and is represented by vector LR. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that point R is the input to the base of the common-emitter amplifier. Also, vector LR shows 
that the signal on the base is regenerative (aiding the circuit operation). This meets the regenerative 
feedback requirement. An exact 60-degree phase shift per stage is not required, but the sum of the three 
phase shifts must equal 180 degrees. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">For a given RC network, only one frequency of the initial noise signal will be shifted exactly 180 
degrees. In other words, the network is frequency selective. Therefore, the RC network is the frequency-
determining device since the lengths of the vectors and their phase relationships depend on frequency. 
The frequency of oscillations is governed by the values of resistance and capacitance in these sections. 
Variable resistors and capacitors may be used to provide tuning in the feedback network to allow for 
minor variations in phase shift. For an RC phase-shift oscillator, the amplifier is biased for class A 
operation to minimize distortion of the wave or signal. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">LC Network 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Some sine-wave oscillators use resonant circuits consisting of inductance and capacitance. For 
example, recall the tank circuit in which a resonant circuit stores energy alternately in the inductor and 
capacitor, producing a sine wave. You studied this action of the tank circuit in chapter 1. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If there were absolutely no internal resistances in a tank circuit, oscillations would continue 
indefinitely, as shown in figure 2-3, view (A). Each resonant circuit does, however, contain some 
resistance which dissipates power. This power loss causes the amplitude to decrease, as shown in views 
(B) and (C). The reduction of amplitude in an oscillator circuit is referred to as DAMPING. Damping is 
caused by both tank and load resistances. The larger the tank resistance, the greater the amount of 
damping. Loading the tank causes the same effect as increasing the internal resistance of the tank. The 
effect of this damping can be overcome by applying regenerative feedback.

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-4 shows a block diagram of a typical LC oscillator. Notice that the oscillator contains the 
three basic requirements for sustained oscillations: amplification, a frequency-determining device, and 
regenerative feedback. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The amplifier supplies energy to begin what is known as the FLYWHEEL EFFECT. The flywheel 
effect is the maintenance of oscillations in a circuit in the intervals between pulses of excitation energy. 
Recall that in chapter 1 the tank circuit alternately stored energy in the inductor and capacitor. The LC 
network provides initial oscillations. A portion of the output of the LC network is then returned to the 
input of the amplifier through the regenerative-feedback network to sustain the oscillations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When a tank circuit is used to develop oscillations in an oscillator, the output frequency of the 
oscillator is primarily the resonant frequency of the tank circuit and can be found by the formula:

</p><h3 class="subsection">Crystals 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Another frequency-determining device is the CRYSTAL. The crystal may be used with a tank 
circuit, or it may perform alone. Crystals exhibit a characteristic known as the PIEZOELECTRIC 
EFFECT. The piezoelectric effect is the property of a crystal by which mechanical forces produce 
electrical charges and, conversely, electrical charges produce mechanical forces. This effect is a form of 
oscillation similar to the flywheel effect of a tank circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The piezoelectric effect can be seen in a number of crystal substances. The most important of these 
are the minerals quartz and Rochelle salt. Although quartz does not exhibit the piezoelectric effect to the 
degree that Rochelle salt does, quartz is used for frequency control in oscillators because of its greater 
mechanical strength. Another mineral, tourmaline, is physically strong like quartz; but because it is more 
expensive, it is not used extensively as an fdd. This discussion will deal only with the quartz crystal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The crystals used in oscillator circuits are thin sheets, or wafers, cut from natural or synthetic quartz 
and ground to a specific thickness to obtain the desired resonant frequency. The crystals are mounted in 
holders, which support them physically and provide electrodes by which voltage is applied. The holder 
must allow the crystals freedom for vibration. There are many different types of holders. One type is 
shown in figure 2-5. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">As you have just studied, a basic oscillator can be broken down into three main sections: a 
frequency-determining device, an amplifier, and a feedback circuit. The frequency-determining device in 
an LC oscillator is usually an LC tank circuit. Although the tank circuit is normally found in the input 
circuit of an oscillator (both electron tube and transistor), it sometimes appears in the output circuit. The 
differences in magnitude of plate and collector currents and shunting impedances are considerations in the 
designed locations of such tank circuits. In both solid-state and electron tube circuits, oscillations take 
place in the tuned circuit. Both the electron tube and the transistor function primarily as electrical valves 
that amplify and automatically deliver to the input circuit the proper amount of energy to sustain 
oscillations. In both tube and transistor oscillators, the feedback circuit couples energy of the proper 
amount and of the correct phase from the output to the input circuit to sustain oscillations.

action of an inductor and a capacitor. The feedback signal is coupled from this circuit by either of two 
means. The first method is to take some of the energy from the inductor. This can be done by any one of 
the three ways shown in figure 2-7, views (A), (B), and (C). When an oscillator uses a TICKLER COIL, 
as shown in view (A), it is referred to as an ARMSTRONG OSCILLATOR. When an oscillator uses a 
tapped coil (view (B)) or a split coil (view (C)), it is referred to as a HARTLEY OSCILLATOR. The 
second method of coupling the feedback signal is to use two capacitors in the tank circuit and tap the 
feedback signal between them. This is shown in view (D). An oscillator using this method is referred to as 
a COLPITTS OSCILLATOR. Each of these particular oscillators is named after the person who

which dc power is applied. An oscillator in which dc power is supplied to the transistor through the tank 
circuit, or a portion of the tank circuit, is said to be SERIES FED. An oscillator which receives its dc 
power for the transistor through a path separate and parallel to the tank circuit is said to be PARALLEL

amplitude. In doing so, the stability of an oscillator is very important. Depending on its application, an 
oscillator may be required to have either good frequency stability or amplitude stability; in many 
circumstances, both are required. Of the two, good frequency stability is usually considered more 
important.

by transistor characteristics or by variations in the external circuit elements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As stated before, when output power is not of prime importance, transistor oscillators may be biased 
class A to ensure stability and minimize distortion. When this is done, the dc operating point established 
by the power supply is chosen so that the operation of the transistor oscillator occurs over the most linear 
portion of the transistor's characteristic curve. When the operation of the circuit falls into the nonlinear 
portion of the characteristic curve, the transistor's parameters (voltages and currents) vary. These 
parameters are basic to the stable frequency of the transistor oscillator. Operating frequency variations 
may occur with changes in these bias voltages. Thus, a constant supply voltage is a prime requirement for 
good frequency stability. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The use of a common bias source for both collector and emitter electrodes results in a relatively

</p><p class="paragraph">Just as in any transistor circuit, changes in the transistor operating point and changes in temperature

stability. Output amplitude may be kept relatively constant by ensuring that the feedback is large enough 
that the collector current is maintained at the proper level. Feedback used in this manner makes the output

R1 is normally adjusted so that the L1 current is adequate to sustain tank oscillations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">View (D) shows the complete oscillator circuit. Connecting the feedback network through coupling 
capacitor C2 to the base of Q1 forms a "closed loop" for feedback (shown by the solid arrows). Let's 
verify that the feedback is regenerative. Assume a positive signal on the base of Q1. The transistor 
conducts heavily when forward biased. This current flow through L1 and R1 causes the voltage across L1 
to increase. The voltage increase is inductively coupled to L2 and inverted. This action ensures that the 
voltage is positive at the base end of L2 and C1 and in phase with the base voltage. The positive signal is 
now coupled through C2 to the base of Q1. The regenerative feedback offsets the damping in the 
frequency-determining network and has sufficient amplitude to provide unity circuit gain. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit in view (D) has all three requirements for an oscillator: (1) amplification, (2) a frequency-
determining device, and (3) regenerative feedback. The oscillator in this schematic drawing is a tuned-
base oscillator, because the fdd is in the base circuit. If the fdd were in the collector circuit, it would be a 
tuned-collector oscillator. The circuit in view (D) is basically an Armstrong oscillator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Refer to figure 2-10, view (D), for the following discussion of the circuit operation of the Armstrong 
oscillator. When VCC is applied to the circuit. a small amount of base current flows through R2 which sets 
the forward bias on Q1. This forward bias causes collector current to flow from ground through Q1, R1, 
and L1 to +VCC. The current through L1 develops a magnetic field which induces a voltage into the tank 
circuit. The voltage is positive at the top of L2 and C1. At this time, two actions occur. First, resonant 
tank capacitor C1 charges to this voltage; the tank circuit now has stored energy. Second, coupling 
capacitor C2 couples the positive signal to the base of Q1. With a positive signal on its base, Q1 conducts 
harder. With Q1 conducting harder, more current flows through L1, a larger voltage is induced into L2, 
and a larger positive signal is coupled back to the base of Q1. While this is taking place, the frequency-
determining device is storing more energy and C1 is charging to the voltage induced into L2. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The transistor will continue to increase in conduction until it reaches saturation. At saturation, the 
collector current of Q1 is at a maximum value and cannot increase any further. With a steady current 
through L1, the magnetic fields are not moving and no voltage is induced into the secondary. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With no external voltage applied, C1 acts as a voltage source and discharges. As the voltage across 
C1 decreases, its energy is transferred to the magnetic field of L2. Now, let's look at C2. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The coupling capacitor, C2, has charged to approximately the same voltage as C1. As C1 discharges, 
C2 discharges. The primary discharge path for C2 is through R2 (shown by the dashed arrow). As C2 
discharges, the voltage drop across R2 opposes the forward bias on Q1 and collector current begins to 
decrease. This is caused by the decreasing positive potential at the base of Q1. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A decrease in collector current allows the magnetic field of L1 to collapse. The collapsing field of L1 
induces a negative voltage into the secondary which is coupled through C2 and makes the base of Q1 
more negative. This, again, is regenerative action; it continues until Q1 is driven into cutoff. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When Q1 is cut off, the tank circuit continues to flywheel, or oscillate. The flywheel effect not only 
produces a sine-wave signal, but it aids in keeping Q1 cut off. Without feedback, the oscillations of L2 
and C1 would dampen out after several cycles. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To ensure that the amplitude of the signal remains constant, regenerative feedback is supplied to the 
tank once each cycle, as follows: As the voltage across C1 reaches maximum negative, C1 begins 
discharging toward 0 volts. Q1 is still below cutoff. C1 continues to discharge through 0 volts and 
becomes positively charged. The tank circuit voltage is again coupled to the base of Q1, so the base 
voltage becomes positive and allows collector current to flow. The collector current creates a magnetic </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

circuit and drives Q1 toward saturation. After saturation is reached, the transistor is again driven into 
cutoff. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The operation of the Armstrong oscillator is basically this: Power applied to the transistor allows 
energy to be applied to the tank circuit causing it to oscillate. Once every cycle, the transistor conducts for 
a short period of time (class C operation) and returns enough energy to the tank to ensure a constant 
amplitude output signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Class C operation has high efficiency and low loading characteristics. The longer Q1 is cut off, the 
less the loading on the frequency-determining device. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-11 shows a tuned-base Armstrong oscillator as you will probably see it. R3 has been added 
to improve temperature stability. Bypass capacitor C3 prevents degeneration. C4 is an output coupling 
capacitor, and impedance-matching transformer T2 provides a method of coupling the output signal. T2 is 
usually a loosely coupled rf transformer which reduces undesired reflected impedance from the load back 
to the oscillator. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Armstrong oscillator is an example of how a class C amplifier can produce a sine-wave output 
that is not distorted. Although class C operation is nonlinear and many harmonic frequencies are 
generated, only one frequency receives enough gain to cause the circuit to oscillate. This is the frequency 
of the resonant tank circuit. Thus, high efficiency and an undistorted output signal can be obtained. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The waveforms in figure 2-12 illustrate the relationship between the collector voltage and collector 
current. Notice that collector current (IC) flows for only a short time during each cycle. While the tank 
circuit is oscillating (figure 2-11), L2 acts as the primary of the transformer and L1 acts as the secondary. 
The signal from the tank is, therefore, coupled through T1 to coupling capacitor C4, and the output 
voltage across L4 is a sine wave. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The HARTLEY OSCILLATOR is an improvement over the Armstrong oscillator. Although its 
frequency stability is not the best possible of all the oscillators, the Hartley oscillator can generate a wide 
range of frequencies and is very easy to tune. The Hartley will operate class C with self-bias for ordinary 
operation. It will operate class A when the output waveform must be of a constant voltage level or of a 
linear waveshape. The two versions of this oscillator are the series-fed and the shunt-fed. The main 
difference between the Armstrong and the Hartley oscillators lies in the design of the feedback (tickler) 
coil. A separate coil is not used. Instead, in the Hartley oscillator, the coil in the tank circuit is a split 
inductor. Current flow through one section induces a voltage in the other section to develop a feedback 
signal. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Series-Fed Hartley Oscillator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">One version of a SERIES-FED HARTLEY OSCILLATOR is shown in figure 2-13. The tank circuit 
consists of the tapped coil (L1 and L2) and capacitor C2. The feedback circuit is from the tank circuit to 
the base of Q1 through the coupling capacitor C1. Coupling capacitor C1 prevents the low dc resistance 
of L2 from placing a short across the emitter-to-base junction and resistor RE. Capacitor C3 bypasses the 
sine-wave signal around the battery, and resistor RE is used for temperature stabilization to prevent 
thermal runaway. Degeneration is prevented by CE in parallel with RE. The amount of bias is determined 
by the values of RB, the emitter-to-base resistance, the small amount of dc resistance of coil L1, and the 
resistance of RE.

</p><p class="paragraph">When a voltage is applied to the circuit, current from the battery flows through coil L1 and to the 
emitter through RE. Current then flows from the emitter to the collector and back to the battery. The surge 
of current through coil L1 induces a voltage in coil L2 to start oscillations within the tank circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When current first starts to flow through coil L1, the bottom of L1 is negative with respect to the top 
of L2. The voltage induced into coil L2 makes the top of L2 positive. As the top of L2 becomes positive, 
the positive potential is coupled to the base of Q1 by capacitor C1. A positive potential on the base results 
in an increase of the forward bias of Q1 and causes collector current to increase. The increased collector 
current also increases the emitter current flowing through coil L1. Increased current through L1 results in 
more energy being supplied to the tank circuit, which, in turn, increases the positive potential at the top of 
the tank (L2) and increases the forward bias of Q1. This action continues until the rate of current change 
through coil L1 can no longer increase. The current through coil L1 and the transistor cannot continue 
increasing indefinitely, or the coil and transistor will burn up. The circuit must be designed, by proper 
selection of the transistor and associated parts, so that some point is reached when the current can no 
longer continue to increase. At this point C2 has charged to the potential across L1 and L2. This is shown 
as the heavy dot on the base waveform. As the current through L1 decreases, the voltage induced in L2 
decreases. The positive potential across the tank begins to decrease and C2 starts discharging through L1 
and L2. This action maintains current flow through the tapped coil and causes a decrease in the forward 
bias of Q1. In turn, this decrease in the forward bias of Q1 causes the collector and emitter current to 
decrease. At the instant the potential across the tank circuit decreases to 0, the energy of the tank circuit is 
contained in the magnetic field of the coil. The oscillator has completed a half cycle of operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Next, the magnetic field around L2 collapses as the current from C2 stops. The action of the 
collapsing magnetic field causes the top of L2 to become negative at this instant. The negative charge 
causes capacitor C2 to begin to charge in the opposite direction. This negative potential is coupled to the 
base of Q1, opposing its forward bias. Most transistor oscillators are operated class A; therefore, the 
positive and negative signals applied to the base of Q1 will not cause it to go into saturation or cutoff. 
When the tank circuit reaches its maximum negative value, the collector and the emitter currents will still 
be present but at a minimum value. The magnetic field will have collapsed and the oscillator will have 
completed 3/4 cycle. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At this point C2 begins to discharge, decreasing the negative potential at the top of L2 (potential will 
swing in the positive direction). As the negative potential applied to the base of Q1 decreases, the 
opposition to the forward bias also decreases. This, in effect, causes the forward bias to begin increasing, 
resulting in increased emitter current flowing through L1. The increase in current through L1 causes 
additional energy to be fed to the tank circuit to replace lost energy. If the energy lost in the tank is 
replaced with an equal or larger amount of energy, oscillations will be sustained. The oscillator has now 
completed 1 cycle and will continue to repeat it over and over again. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Shunt-Fed Hartley Oscillator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A version of a SHUNT-FED HARTLEY OSCILLATOR is shown in figure 2-14. The parts in this 
circuit perform the same basic functions as do their counterparts in the series-fed Hartley oscillator. The 
difference between the series-fed and the shunt-fed circuit is that dc does not flow through the tank 
circuit. The shunt-fed circuit operation is essentially the same as the series-fed Hartley oscillator. When 
voltage is applied to the circuit, Q1 starts conducting. As the collector current of Q1 increases, the change 
(increase) is coupled through capacitor C3 to the tank circuit, causing it to oscillate. C3 also acts as an 
isolation capacitor to prevent dc from flowing through the feedback coil. The oscillations at the collector 
will be coupled through C3 (feedback) to supply energy lost within the tank. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

of junction capacitance. In comparison, the COLPITTS OSCILLATOR has fairly good frequency 
stability, is easy to tune, and can be used for a wide range of frequencies. The large value of split 
capacitance is in parallel with the junctions and minimizes the effect on frequency stability. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Colpitts oscillator is very similar to the shunt-fed Hartley oscillator, except that two capacitors 
are used in the tank circuit instead of a tapped coil (figure 2-15). The Hartley oscillator has a tap between 
two coils, while the Colpitts has a tap between two capacitors. You can change the frequency of the 
Colpitts either by varying the inductance of the coil or by varying the capacitance of the two capacitors in 
the tank circuit. Notice that no coupling capacitor is used between the tank circuit and the base of Q1. 
Capacitors C1 and C2 of the tank circuit are in parallel with the input and the output interelement 
capacitance (capacitance between emitter, base, and collector) of the transistor. Thus the input and the 
output capacitive effect can be minimized on the tank circuit and better frequency stability can be 
obtained than with the Armstrong or the Hartley oscillator. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Notice in this version of the Colpitts oscillator that regenerative feedback is obtained from the tank circuit 
and applied to the emitter. Base bias is provided by resistor RB and RF. Resistor R C is the collector load 
resistor. Resistor RE develops the input signal and also acts as the emitter swamping resistor. The tuned 
circuit consists of C1 and C2 in parallel with the primary winding of transformer T1. The voltage 
developed across C2 is the feedback voltage. Either or both capacitors may be adjusted to control the 
frequency. In the common-base configuration there is no phase difference between the signal at the 
collector and the emitter signal. Therefore, the phase of the feedback signal does not have to be changed. 
When the emitter swings negative, the collector also swings negative and C2 charges negatively at the 
junction of C1 and C2. This negative charge across C2 is fed back to the emitter. This increases the 
reverse bias on Q1. The collector of Q1 becomes more negative and C2 charges to a negative potential. 
This feedback effect continues until the collector of Q1 is unable to become any more negative. At that 
time the primary of T1 will act as a source because of normal tank circuit operation. As its field collapses, 
the tank potential will reverse and C1 and C2 will begin to discharge. As C2 becomes less negative, the 
reverse bias on Q1 decreases and its collector voltage swings in the positive direction. C1 and C2 will 
continue to discharge and then charge in a positive direction. This positive-going voltage across C2 will 
be fed back to the emitter as regenerative feedback. This will continue until the field around the primary 
of T1 collapses. At that time the collector of Q1 will be at a maximum positive value. C1 and C2 will 
begin to discharge and the potential at their junction will become less positive. This increases the reverse 
bias on Q1 and drives the collector negative, causing C1 and C2 to charge in a negative direction and to 
repeat the cycle. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">As mentioned earlier, resistive-capacitive (RC) networks provide regenerative feedback and 
determine the frequency of operation in RESISTIVE-CAPACITIVE (RC) OSCILLATORS. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The oscillators presented in this chapter have used resonant tank circuits (LC). You should already 
know how the LC tank circuit stores energy alternately in the inductor and capacitor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The major difference between the LC and RC oscillator is that the frequency-determining device in 
the RC oscillator is not a tank circuit. Remember, the LC oscillator can operate with class A or C biasing 
because of the oscillator action of the resonant tank. The RC oscillator, however, must use class A biasing 
because the RC frequency-determining device doesn't have the oscillating ability of a tank circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An RC FEEDBACK or PHASE-SHIFT oscillator is shown in figure 2-17. Components C1, R1, C2, 
R2, C3, and RB are the feedback and frequency-determining network. This RC network also provides the

</p><h3 class="subsection">Phase-Shift Oscillators 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The PHASE-SHIFT OSCILLATOR, shown in figure 2-17, is a sine-wave generator that uses a 
resistive-capacitive (RC) network as its frequency-determining device. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As discussed earlier in the common-emitter amplifier configuration (figure 2-17), there is a 
180-degree phase difference between the base and the collector signal. To obtain the regenerative 
feedback in the phase-shift oscillator, you need a phase shift of 180 degrees between the output and the 
input signal. An RC network consisting of three RC sections provides the proper feedback and phase 
inversion to provide this regenerative feedback. Each section shifts the feedback signal 60 degrees in 
phase. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the impedance of an RC network is capacitive, the current flowing through it leads the applied 
voltage by a specific phase angle. The phase angle is determined by the amount of resistance and 
capacitance of the RC section. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the capacitance is a fixed value, a change in the resistance value will change the phase angle. If the 
resistance could be changed to zero, we could get a maximum phase angle of 90 degrees. But since a 
voltage cannot be developed across zero resistance, a 90-degree phase shift is not possible. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With a small value of resistance, however, the phase angle or phase shift is less than 90 degrees. In 
the phase-shift oscillator, therefore, at least three RC sections are needed to give the required 180-degree 
phase shift for regenerative feedback. The values of resistance and capacitance are generally chosen so 
that each section provides about a 60-degree phase shift. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Resistors RB, RF, and RC provide base and collector bias. Capacitor C E bypasses ac variations around 
the emitter resistor R E. Capacitors C1, C2, and C3 and resistors R1, R2, and R B form the feedback and 
phase-shifting network. Resistor R2 is variable for fine tuning to compensate for any small changes in 
value of the other components of the phase-shifting network. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When power is applied to the circuit, oscillations are started by any random noise (random electrical 
variations generated internally in electronic components). A change in the flow of base current results in 
an amplified change in collector current which is phase-shifted the 180 degrees. When the signal is 
returned to the base, it has been shifted 180 degrees by the action of the RC network, making the circuit 
regenerative.  View (A) of figure 2-18 shows the amount of phase shift produced by C1 and R1. View (B) 
shows the amount of phase shift produced by C2 and R2 (signal received from C1 and R1), and view (C) 
shows the complete phase shift as the signal leaves the RC network. With the correct amount of resistance 
and capacitance in the phase-shifting network, the 180-degree phase shift occurs at only one frequency. 
At any other than the desired frequency, the capacitive reactance increases or decreases and causes an 
incorrect phase relationship (the feedback becomes degenerative). Thus, the oscillator works at only one 
frequency. To find the resonant frequency (fr) of an RC phase shift oscillator, use the following formula:

CONTROLLED OSCILLATORS are the standard means used for maintaining the frequency of radio 
transmitting stations within their assigned frequency limits. A crystal-controlled oscillator is usually used 
to produce an output which is highly stable and at a very precise frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As stated earlier, crystals used in electrical circuits are thin sheets cut from the natural crystal and are 
ground to the proper thickness for the desired resonant frequency. For any given crystal cut, the thinner 
the crystal, the higher the resonant frequency. The "cut" (X, Y, AT, and so forth) of the crystal means the 
precise way in which the usable crystal is cut from the natural crystal. Some typical crystal cuts may be 
seen in figure 2-19. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Transmitters which require a very high degree of frequency stability, such as a broadcast transmitter, 
use temperature-controlled ovens to maintain a constant crystal temperature. These ovens are 
thermostatically controlled containers in which the crystals are placed.

frequency and thus will operate at harmonic frequencies. Crystals which are not of uniform thickness may 
have two or more resonant frequencies. Usually one resonant frequency is more pronounced than the 
others. The other less pronounced resonant frequencies are referred to as SPURIOUS frequencies. 
Sometimes such a crystal oscillates at two frequencies at the same time.

some frequency above the series-resonant point, the crystal unit will act as a parallel-tuned circuit. A 
parallel-tuned circuit has a MAXIMUM impedance at the parallel-resonant frequency and acts inductively 
below parallel resonance (figure 2-21). Therefore, at some frequency, depending upon the cut of the 
crystal, the crystal unit will act as a parallel-tuned circuit.

feeds back a portion of the output signal to the emitter without a phase shift. The oscillating frequency is 
determined not only by the crystal but also by the parallel capacitance caused by capacitors C1 and CE. 
This parallel capacitance affects the oscillator frequency by lowering it. Any change in capacitance of

</h2><p class="paragraph">A sinusoidal (sine-wave) oscillator is one that will produce output pulses at a predetermined 
frequency for an indefinite period of time; that is, it operates continuously. Many electronic circuits in 
equipment such as radar require that an oscillator be turned on for a specific period of time and that it 
remain in an off condition until required at a later time. These circuits are referred to as PULSED 
OSCILLATORS or RINGING OSCILLATORS. They are nothing more than sine-wave oscillators that 
are turned on and off at specific times. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-25, view (A), shows a pulsed oscillator with the resonant tank in the emitter circuit. A 
positive input makes Q1 conduct heavily and current flow through L1; therefore no oscillations can take 
place. A negative-going input pulse (referred to as a gate) cuts off Q1, and the tank oscillates until the 
gate ends or until the ringing stops, whichever comes first.

pulsed oscillator. To see how this circuit operates, assume that the Q of the LC tank circuit is high enough 
to prevent damping. An output from the circuit is obtained when the input gate goes negative (T0 to T1 
and T2 to T3). The remainder of the time (T1 to T2) the transistor conducts heavily and there is no output 
from the circuit. The width of the input gate controls the time for the output signal. Making the gate wider 
causes the output to be present (or ring) for a longer time. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Frequency of a Pulsed Oscillator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The frequency of a pulsed oscillator is determined by both the input gating signal and the resonant 
frequency of the tank circuit. When a sinusoidal oscillator is resonant at 1 megahertz, the output is 1 
million cycles per second. In the case of a pulsed oscillator, the number of cycles present in the output is 
determined by the gating pulse width. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If a 1-megahertz oscillator is cut off for 1/2 second, or 50 percent of the time, then the output is 
500,000 cycles at the 1 -megahertz rate. In other words, the frequency of the tank circuit is still 1 
megahertz, but the oscillator is only allowed to produce 500,000 cycles each second. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The output frequency can be determined by controlling how long the tank circuit will oscillate. For 
example, suppose a negative input gate of 500 microseconds and a positive input gate of 999,500 
microseconds (total of 1 second) are applied. The transistor will be cut off for 500 microseconds and the 
tank circuit will oscillate for that 500 microseconds, producing an output signal. The transistor will then 
conduct for 999,500 microseconds and the tank circuit will not oscillate during that time period. The 500 
microseconds that the tank circuit is allowed to oscillate will allow only 500 cycles of the 1-megahertz 
tank frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You can easily check this frequency by using the following formula:

get the number of cycles (500). 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are several different varieties of pulsed oscillators for different applications. The schematic 
diagram shown in figure 2-25, view (A), is an emitter-loaded pulsed oscillator. The tank circuit can be 
placed in the collector circuit, in which case it is referred to as a collector-loaded pulsed oscillator. The 
difference between the emitter-loaded and the collector-loaded oscillator is in the output signal. The first 
alternation of an emitter-loaded npn pulsed oscillator is negative. The first alternation of the collector-
loaded pulsed oscillator is positive. If a pnp is used, the oscillator will reverse the first alternation of both 
the emitter-loaded and the collector-loaded oscillator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You probably have noticed by now that feedback has not been mentioned in this discussion. 
Remember that regenerative feedback was a requirement for sustained oscillations. In the case of the 
pulsed oscillator, oscillations are only required for a very short period of time. You should understand, 
however, that as the width of the input gate (which cuts off the transistor) is increased, the amplitude of 
the sine wave begins to decrease (dampen) near the end of the gate period because of the lack of 
feedback. If a long period of oscillation is required for a particular application, a pulsed oscillator with 
regenerative feedback is used. The principle of operation remains the same except that the feedback 
network sustains the oscillation period for the desired amount of time.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HARMONICS-2-30-">HARMONICS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">From your study of oscillators, you should know that the oscillator will oscillate at the resonant 
frequency of the tank circuit. Although the tank circuit is resonant at a particular frequency, many other 
frequencies other than the resonant frequency are present in the oscillator. These other frequencies are 
referred to as HARMONICS. A harmonic is defined as a sinusoidal wave having a frequency that is a 
multiple of the fundamental frequency. In other words, a sine wave that is twice that fundamental 
frequency is referred to as the SECOND HARMONIC. 
</p><p class="paragraph">What you must remember is that the current in circuits operating at the resonant frequency is 
relatively large in amplitude. The harmonic frequency amplitudes are relatively small. For example, the 
second harmonic of a fundamental frequency has only 20 percent of the amplitude of the resonant 
frequency. A third harmonic has perhaps 10 percent of the amplitude of the fundamental frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One useful purpose of harmonics is that of frequency multiplication. It can be used in circuits to 
multiply the fundamental frequency to a higher frequency. The need for frequency-multiplier circuits 
results from the fact that the frequency stability of most oscillators decreases as frequency increases. 
Relatively good stability can be achieved at the lower frequencies. Thus, to achieve optimum stability, an 
oscillator is operated at a low frequency, and one or more stages of multiplication are used to raise the 
signal to the desired operating frequency.

Although the collector current flows in pulses, the alternating collector voltage is sinusoidal because of 
the action of the tank circuit. When the output tank circuit is tuned to the required harmonic, the tank 
circuit acts as a filter, accepting the desired frequency and rejecting all others. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-27 illustrates the waveforms in a typical doubler circuit. You can see that the pulses of 
collector current are the same frequency as the input signal. These pulses of collector current energize the 
tank circuit and cause it to oscillate at twice the base signal frequency. Between the pulses of collector 
current, the tank circuit continues to oscillate. Therefore, the tank circuit receives a current pulse for every 
other cycle of its output. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-28 is the schematic diagram of a buffer amplifier. This circuit is a common-collector 
amplifier. A common-collector amplifier has a high input impedance and a low output impedance. Since 
the output of an oscillator is connected to the high impedance of the common-collector amplifier, the 
buffer has little effect on the operation of the oscillator. The output of the common-collector buffer is then 
connected to an external load; therefore, the changes in the output load cannot reflect back to the 
oscillator circuit. Thus, the buffer amplifier reduces interaction between the load and the oscillator. Figure 
2-29 illustrates a shunt-fed Hartley oscillator with a buffer amplifier. This is "one-way" coupling since the 
oscillator signal is coupled forward, but load changes are not coupled back to the oscillator.

important points of this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">WAVE GENERATORS can be classified according to the SINUSOIDAL or NONSINUSOIDAL 
waveforms produced. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SINUSOIDAL WAVE GENERATORS (oscillators) produce a sine wave of constant amplitude 
and frequency. There are three ways to control the frequency of sine-wave generators: (1) RC 
NETWORKS, (2) LC NETWORKS, and (3) CRYSTALS. 
</p><p class="paragraph">NONSINUSOIDAL WAVE GENERATORS (oscillators) generate complex waveforms such as 
SQUARE WAVES, RECTANGULAR WAVES, SAWTOOTH WAVES, TRAPEZOIDAL WAVES, 
and TRIGGERS. Nonsinusoidal wave generators are often called RELAXATION OSCILLATORS.

FREQUENCY-DETERMINING NETWORK.

STABILITY.

point. Feedback that aids the input signal is REGENERATIVE or POSITIVE. Feedback that opposes the 
input signal is DEGENERATIVE or NEGATIVE. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The three basic circuit configurations used for oscillators are COMMON COLLECTOR, 
COMMON BASE, and COMMON EMITTER. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the COMMON-COLLECTOR configuration there is no PHASE SHIFT between input and 
output. It is not necessary for the feedback network to provide a phase shift. Voltage gain is less than 
unity (one) and power gain is low so it is very seldom used as an oscillator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the COMMON-BASE configuration, there is no PHASE SHIFT between input and output. It is 
not necessary for the feedback network to provide a phase shift. Voltage and power gain are high enough 
to give satisfactory operation in an oscillator circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the COMMON-EMITTER configuration, there is a 180-degree PHASE SHIFT between input 
and output. The feedback network must provide another phase shift of 180 degrees. It has a high power 
gain. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

left side of the pulse is called the LEADING EDGE and the right side is called the TRAILING EDGE. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Time is required for a voltage or current to change in amplitude. The interval of time needed for the 
voltage to go from 0 to 100 percent (or from 100 to 0 percent) of its maximum value is called the 
TRANSIENT INTERVAL. The two types of transient intervals are RISE TIME and FALL TIME. Rise 
time is more accurately defined as the time required for the voltage to build up from 10 percent to 90 
percent of the maximum amplitude point. Fall time is the time required for the voltage to drop from 90 
percent to 10 percent of the maximum amplitude point. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In this text you will be presented with information in which waveforms appear to have instantaneous 
rise and fall times. This is done to simplify the presentation of the material. In reality these waveforms do 
have rise and fall times (transient intervals). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Rectangular Wave 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A rectangular wave is similar to the square wave. The difference is that in the rectangular waveform, 
the two alternations of the waveform are of unequal time duration. Figure 3-1, view (C), shows that the 
negative alternation (pulse) is shorter (in time) than the positive alternation. The negative alternation 
could be represented as the longer of the two alternations. Either way, the appearance is that of a 
rectangle. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Sawtooth Wave 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The SAWTOOTH waveform is shown in figure 3-1, view (D). A sawtooth wave resembles the teeth 
of a saw blade. There is a rapid vertical rise of voltage from T0 to T1, which is linear (straight). At T1 this 
voltage abruptly falls (essentially no time used) to its previous static value. The voltage remains at this 
value until T2 when it again has a linear rise. You can see this action in an oscilloscope where there are 
two voltage input locations, vertical and horizontal. If you apply a linear voltage to the vertical input, the 
electron beam will be forced to move in a vertical direction on the crt. A linear voltage applied to the 
horizontal input will cause the electron beam to move horizontally across the crt. The application of two 
linear voltages, one to the vertical input and one to the horizontal input at the same time, will cause the </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

sawtooth wave is made to appear on an oscilloscope. You should refer to NEETS, Module 6, Electronic 
Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies, Chapter 2, for a review of oscilloscopes. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Trapezoidal Wave 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A TRAPEZOIDAL wave looks like a sawtooth wave on top of a square or rectangular wave, as 
shown in figure 3-1, view (E). The leading edge of a trapezoidal wave is called the JUMP voltage. The 
next portion of the wave is the linear rise or SLOPE. The trailing edge is called the FALL or DECAY. A 
trapezoidal wave is used to furnish deflection current in the electromagnetic cathode ray tube and is found 
in television and radar display systems. Electromagnetic cathode ray tubes use coils for the deflection 
system, and a linear rise in current is required for an accurate horizontal display. The square or 
rectangular wave portion provides the jump voltage for a linear rise in current through the resistance of 
the coil. This will be explained further in a discussion of the trapezoidal sweep generator. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Triggers 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A trigger is a very narrow pulse, as shown in figure 3-1, view (F). Trigger pulses are normally used 
to turn other circuits on or off. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WAVEFORM-GENERATOR-3-5-">WAVEFORM GENERATOR 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Nonsinusoidal oscillators generate complex waveforms such as those just discussed. Because the 
outputs of these oscillators are generally characterized by a sudden change, or relaxation, these oscillators 
are often called RELAXATION OSCILLATORS. The pulse repetition rate of these oscillators is usually 
governed by the charge and discharge timing of a capacitor in series with a resistor. However, some 
oscillators contain inductors that, along with circuit resistance, affect the output frequency. These RC and 
LC networks within oscillator circuits are used for frequency determination. Within this category of 
relaxation oscillators are MULTIVIBRATORS, BLOCKING OSCILLATORS, and SAWTOOTH- and 
TRAPEZOIDAL-WAVE GENERATORS. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Many electronic circuits are not in an "on" condition all of the time. In computers, for example, 
waveforms must be turned on and off for specific lengths of time. The time intervals vary from tenths of 
microseconds to several thousand microseconds. Square and rectangular waveforms are normally used to 
turn such circuits on and off because the sharp leading and trailing edges make them ideal for timing 
purposes. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MULTIVIBRATORS-3-5-">MULTIVIBRATORS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The type of circuit most often used to generate square or rectangular waves is the multivibrator. A 
multivibrator, as shown in figure 3-3, is basically two amplifier circuits arranged with regenerative 
feedback. One of the amplifiers is conducting while the other is cut off. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When an input signal to one amplifier is large enough, the transistor can be driven into cutoff, and its 
collector voltage will be almost V CC. However, when the transistor is driven into saturation, its collector 
voltage will be about 0 volts. A circuit that is designed to go quickly from cutoff to saturation will 
produce a square or rectangular wave at its output. This principle is used in multivibrators. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Multivibrators are classified according to the number of steady (stable) states of the circuit. A steady 
state exists when circuit operation is essentially constant; that is, one transistor remains in conduction and 
the other remains cut off until an external signal is applied. The three types of multivibrators are the 
ASTABLE, MONOSTABLE, and BISTABLE. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The astable circuit has no stable state. With no external signal applied, the transistors alternately 
switch from cutoff to saturation at a frequency determined by the RC time constants of the coupling 
circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The monostable circuit has one stable state; one transistor conducts while the other is cut off. A 
signal must be applied to change this condition. After a period of time, determined by the internal RC 
components, the circuit will return to its original condition where it remains until the next signal arrives. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The bistable multivibrator has two stable states. It remains in one of the stable states until a trigger is 
applied. It then FLIPS to the other stable condition and remains there until another trigger is applied. The 
multivibrator then changes back (FLOPS) to its first stable state.

oscilloscope, you would see continuous square or rectangular waveforms. The astable multivibrator has 
two outputs, but NO inputs. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's look at the multivibrator in figure 3-3 again. This is an astable multivibrator. The astable 
multivibrator is said to oscillate. To understand why the astable multivibrator oscillates, assume that 
transistor Q1 saturates and transistor Q2 cuts off when the circuit is energized. This situation is shown in 
figure 3-4. We assume Q1 saturates and Q2 is in cutoff because the circuit is symmetrical; that is, 
R1 = R4, R2 = R3, C1 = C2, and Q1 = Q2. It is impossible to tell which transistor will actually conduct 
when the circuit is energized. For this reason, either of the transistors may be assumed to conduct for 
circuit analysis purposes. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Essentially, all the current in the circuit flows through Q1; Q1 offers almost no resistance to current 
flow. Notice that capacitor C1 is charging. Since Q1 offers almost no resistance in its saturated state, the 
rate of charge of C1 depends only on the time constant of R2 and C1 (recall that TC = RC). Notice that 
the right-hand side of capacitor C1 is connected to the base of transistor Q2, which is now at cutoff. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's analyze what is happening. The right-hand side of capacitor C1 is becoming increasingly 
negative. If the base of Q2 becomes sufficiently negative, Q2 will conduct. After a certain period of time, 
the base of Q2 will become sufficiently negative to cause Q2 to change states from cutoff to conduction. 
The time necessary for Q2 to become saturated is determined by the time constant R2C1. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The next state is shown in figure 3-5. The negative voltage accumulated on the right side on 
capacitor C1 has caused Q2 to conduct. Now the following sequence of events takes place almost 
instantaneously. Q2 starts conducting and quickly saturates, and the voltage at output 2 changes from 
approximately −VCC to approximately 0 volts. This change in voltage is coupled through C2 to the base of 
Q1, forcing Q1 to cutoff. Now Q1 is in cutoff and Q2 is in saturation. This is the circuit situation shown 
in figure 3-6. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that figure 3-6 is the mirror image of figure 3-4. In figure 3-6 the left side of capacitor C2 
becomes more negative at a rate determined by the time constant R3C2. As the left side of C2 becomes 
more negative, the base of Q1 also becomes more negative. When the base of Q1 becomes negative 
enough to allow Q1 to conduct, Q1 will again go into saturation. The resulting change in voltage at output 
1 will cause Q2 to return to the cutoff state. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at the output waveform from transistor Q2, as shown in figure 3-7. The output voltage (from 
either output of the multivibrator) alternates from approximately 0 volts to approximately −VCC, 
remaining in each state for a definite period of time. The time may range from a microsecond to as much 
as a second or two. In some applications, the time period of higher voltage (−VCC) and the time period of 
lower voltage (0 volts) will be equal. Other applications require differing higher- and lower-voltage times. 
For example, timing and gating circuits often have different pulse widths as shown in figure 3-8. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Q1 (through C1) causes Q1 to go into saturation, which drives Q2 to cutoff. The circuit will remain in this 
condition as long as the base voltage of Q2 is positive. The length of time the base of Q2 will remain

of cutoff and goes into saturation. Also, Q1 is caused to come out of saturation and is cut off. The base 
voltage waveform of Q1 shows a positive potential that is holding Q1 at cutoff. This voltage would 
normally hold Q1 at cutoff until a point between T2 and T3. However, at time T2 another trigger is 
applied to the base of Q1, causing it to begin conducting. Q1 goes into saturation and Q2 is caused to cut 
off. This action repeats each time a trigger (T2, T4, T6) is applied. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The prt of the input triggers must be shorter than the natural free-running prt of the astable

make certain the triggers control the prt of the output. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Monostable Multivibrator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The monostable multivibrator (sometimes called a ONE-SHOT MULTIVIBRATOR) is a square- or 
rectangular-wave generator with just one stable condition. With no input signal (quiescent condition) one 
amplifier conducts and the other is in cutoff. The monostable multivibrator is basically used for pulse 
stretching. It is used in computer logic systems and communication navigation equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The operation of the monostable multivibrator is relatively simple. The input is triggered with a 
pulse of voltage. The output changes from one voltage level to a different voltage level. The output 
remains at this new voltage level for a definite period of time. Then the circuit automatically reverts to its 
original condition and remains that way until another trigger pulse is applied to the input. The monostable 
multivibrator actually takes this series of input triggers and converts them to uniform square pulses, as 
shown in figure 3-10. All of the square output pulses are of the same amplitude and time duration.

</p><p class="paragraph">The schematic for a monostable multivibrator is shown in figure 3-11. Like the astable multivibrator, 
one transistor conducts and the other cuts off when the circuit is energized. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Recall that when the astable multivibrator was first energized, it was impossible to predict which 
transistor would initially go to cutoff because of circuit symmetry. The one-shot circuit is not symmetrical 
like the astable multivibrator. Positive voltage VBB is applied through R5 to the base of Q1. This positive 
voltage causes Q1 to cut off. Transistor Q2 saturates because of the negative voltage applied from −VCC 
to its base through R2. Therefore, Q1 is cut off and Q2 is saturated before a trigger pulse is applied, as 
shown in figure 3-12. The circuit is shown in its stable state. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's take a more detailed look at the circuit conditions in this stable state (refer to figure 3-12). As 
stated above, Q1 is cut off, so no current flows through R1, and the collector of Q1 is at −VCC. Q2 is 
saturated and has practically no voltage drop across it, so its collector is essentially at 0 volts. R5 and R3 
form a voltage divider from VBB to the ground potential at the collector of Q2. The tie point between these 
two resistors will be positive. Thus, the base of Q1 is held positive, ensuring that Q1 remains cutoff. Q2 </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

across R2. If the collector of Q1 is near −VCC and the base of Q2 is near ground, C1 must be charged to 
nearly VCC volts with the polarity shown. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now that all the components and voltages have been described for the stable state, let us see how the 
circuit operates (see figure 3-13). Assume that a negative pulse is applied at the input terminal. C2 
couples this voltage change to the base of Q1 and starts Q1 conducting. Q1 quickly saturates, and its 
collector voltage immediately rises to ground potential. This sharp voltage increase is coupled through C1 
to the base of Q2, causing Q2 to cut off; the collector voltage of Q2 immediately drops to VCC. The 
voltage divider formed by R5 and R3 then holds the base of Q1 negative, and Q1 is locked in saturation. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The one-shot multivibrator has now been turned on by applying a pulse at the input. It will turn itself 
off after a period of time. To see how it does this, look at figure 3-13 again. Q1 is held in saturation by the 
negative voltage applied through R3 to its base, so the circuit cannot be turned off here. Notice that the 
base of Q2 is connected to C1. The positive charge on C1 keeps Q2 cutoff. Remember that a positive 
voltage change (essentially a pulse) was coupled from the collector of Q1 when it began conducting to the 
base of Q2, placing Q2 in cutoff. When the collector of Q1 switches from -VCC volts to 0 volts, the charge 
on C1 acts like a battery with its negative terminal on the collector of Q1, and its positive terminal 
connected to the base of Q2. This voltage is what cuts off Q2. C1 will now begin to discharge through Q1 
to ground, back through −VCC, through R2 to the other side of C1. The time required for C1 to discharge 
depends on the RC time constant of C1 and R2. Figure 3-14 is a timing diagram that shows the negative 
input pulse and the resultant waveforms that you would expect to see for this circuit description. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Q1 and Q2 return to their stable states. This is simply the time required for C1 to gain electrons on its left 
side. This charge time is determined by the R1C1 time constant. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another version of the monostable multivibrator is shown in figure 3-15. View (A) is the circuit and 
view (B) shows the associated waveforms. In its stable condition (T0), Q1 is cut off and Q2 is conducting. 
The input trigger (positive pulse at T1) is applied to the collector of Q1 and coupled by C1 to the base of 
Q2 causing Q2 to be cut off. The collector voltage of Q2 then goes −VCC. The more negative voltage at 
the collector of Q2 forward biases Q1 through R4. With the forward bias, Q1 conducts, and the collector 
voltage of Q1 goes to about 0 volts. C1 now discharges and keeps Q2 cut off. Q2 remains cut off until C1 
discharges enough to allow Q2 to conduct again (T2). When Q2 conducts again, its collector voltage goes 
toward 0 volts and Q1 is cut off. The circuit returns to its quiescent state and has completed a cycle. The 
circuit remains in this stable state until the next trigger arrives (T3).

polarity and amplitude is applied to the circuit, it will change states and remain there until triggered again. 
The trigger need not have a fixed prf; in fact, triggers from different sources, occurring at different times, 
can be used to switch this circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The bistable multivibrator circuit and the associated waveforms are shown in figure 3-17, views (A) 
and (B), respectively. In this circuit, R1 and R7 are the collector load resistors. Voltage dividers R1, R2, 
and R5 provide forward bias for Q2; R7, R6, and R3 provide forward bias for Q1. These resistors also 
couple the collector signal from one transistor to the base of the other. Observe that this is direct coupling 
of feedback. This type of coupling is required because the circuit depends on input triggers for operation, 
not on RC time constants inside the circuit. Both transistors use common emitter resistor R4 which 
provides emitter coupling. C1 and C2 couple the input triggers to the transistor bases.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that the circuit is symmetrical; that is, each transistor amplifier has the same component 
values. When power is first applied, the voltage divider networks place a negative voltage at the bases of 
Q1 and Q2. Both transistors have forward bias and both conduct. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Due to some slight difference between the two circuits, one transistor will conduct more than the 
other. Assume that Q1 conducts more than Q2. The increased conduction of Q1 causes the collector 
voltage of Q1 to be less negative (more voltage drop across R1). This decreases the forward bias of Q2 
and decreases the conduction of Q2. When Q2 conducts less, its collector voltage becomes more negative. 
The negative-going change at the collector of Q2 is coupled to the base of Q1 and causes Q1 to conduct 
even more heavily. This regenerative action continues until Q2 is cut off and Q1 is saturated. The circuit 
is in a stable state and will remain there until a trigger is applied to change the state. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T1, a negative trigger is applied to both bases through C1 and C2. The trigger does not affect Q1 
since it is already conducting. The trigger overcomes cutoff bias on Q2 and causes it to conduct. As Q2 
goes into conduction, its collector voltage becomes positive. The positive-going change at the Q2 
collector causes a reverse bias on the base of Q1. As the conduction of Q1 decreases to the cutoff point, 
the collector voltage becomes negative. This switching action causes a very rapid change of state with Q2 
now conducting and Q1 cut off. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T2, a negative trigger is again applied to both bases. This time, Q1 is brought into conduction and 
the regenerative switching action cuts off Q2. The bistable multivibrator will continue to change states as 
long as triggers are applied. Notice that two input triggers are required to produce one gate; one to turn it 
on and the other to turn it off. The input trigger frequency is twice the output frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The bistable multivibrator that most technicians know is commonly known by other names: the 
ECCLES-JORDAN circuit and, more commonly, the FLIP-FLOP circuit (figure 3-18). The flip-flop is a 
bistable multivibrator, "bi" meaning two; that is, the flip-flop has two stable states. The flip-flop (f/f) can 
rapidly flip from one state to the other and then flop back to its original state. If a voltmeter were 
connected to the output of a flip-flop, it would measure either a small positive or negative voltage, or a 
particularly low voltage (essentially 0 volts). No matter which voltage is measured, the flip-flop would be 
stable. Remember, stable means that the flip-flop will remain in a particular state indefinitely. It will not 
change states unless the proper type of trigger pulse is applied. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

available to cause the flip-flop to change states. First, a positive-going pulse can be applied to input 1 to 
cause Q1 to change from saturation to cutoff. Second, the same result can be achieved by applying a 
negative-going pulse to input 2. Transistor Q2 would then change from Cutoff to saturation. Normally, a 
pulse is applied to the saturated transistor causing it to cut off. An input pulse which is of the correct 
polarity to change the state of the flip-flop is, as before, called a trigger pulse. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-23 a positive-going trigger pulse has been applied to input 1. The flip-flop has now 
changed states; Q1 is cut off and Q2 is saturated. If a second positive-going trigger pulse is applied to 
input 1, it has no effect. This is because Q1 is already cut off; therefore, a positive pulse on its base has no 
effect. But if a positive-going trigger pulse were applied to input 2, the flip-flop would change back to its 
original state as shown in figure 3-24.

</p><p class="paragraph">So far, the basic flip-flop has used only pnp transistors. It could have just as easily used npn 
transistors. The functional operation would not change; only the polarities required for conduction and 
cutoff change. As a technician, you may see either type of transistor used, npn or pnp. A symbolic block 
diagram is sometimes used to avoid confusion about voltage polarities. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A special kind of block diagram has been adopted as a standard symbol for the flip-flop and is shown 
in figures 3-25 and 3-26. The two inputs are represented by the lines on the left and the outputs by the 
lines on the right. INPUTS to a flip-flop are S (SET) and C (CLEAR) and OUTPUTS from a flip-flop are 
"1" and "0." A trigger pulse applied to the SET input causes the "1" output to be a positive or negative 
voltage, depending on the type of transistor. At the same time, the "0" output equals 0 volts. This 
condition is called the SET STATE. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">If a trigger pulse is applied to the CLEAR input, a positive or negative voltage is produced at the "0" 
output. The "1" output goes to 0 volts. This condition is called the CLEAR STATE, as shown in figure 
3-26. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To determine what state the flip-flop is in, you can measure either the "1" or the "0" output. 
Measuring 0 volts at the "1" output indicates that the flip-flop is in the CLEAR state. If the "0" output is 
measured, a positive or negative voltage would also indicate that the flip-flop is in the CLEAR state. 
Either way, only one reading is necessary. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-27, the flip-flop is in the SET state prior to T0 (negative voltage on the "1" output). Now 
compare the changes in output voltage at each point in time (T0, T1, T2, and T3) with the input pulse. 
Studying this figure should help you understand how the flip-flop works. The positive pulse at T0 on the 
CLEAR input shifts the f/f to the CLEAR state (negative voltage at the "0" output). At T1 a positive pulse 
on the SET input drives the "1" output to the SET state. At T2 a positive pulse on the CLEAR input drives 
the "0" output to a CLEAR state. At T3 another positive pulse is applied to the CLEAR input. This input 
has no effect since the f/f is already in the CLEAR state. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Some flip-flops use a third input lead, as shown in figure 3-28. This third input lead is called a 
TOGGLE (T) input. Every time a pulse is applied to the T input, the flip-flop will change states from 
whatever its state was previously. The two diodes (CR1, CR2) form a STEERING NETWORK. This 
steering network directs a positive input pulse to the saturated transistor, causing it to cut off. Negative 
pulses are blocked by the diodes. Note that if npn transistors were used, the diodes would have to be 
reversed and the TOGGLE signal would have to be negative. For example, assume that Q1 is saturated, 
Q2 is cut off, and a positive pulse is applied the at T input. The input pulse will be directed to both 
transistors. The positive pulse will not affect Q2 since it is already in cutoff. Q1 however, which is 
conducting, will cut off and will cause Q2 to become saturated. The transistors have reversed states. A 
block diagram which represents a multivibrator and its outputs with only a TOGGLE input signal is 
shown in figure 3-29. Studying this figure should help you understand how this flip-flop works. Each 
TOGGLE input causes the output to change states. Figure 3-30 shows what happens when triggers are 
applied to all three inputs of the flip-flop shown in figure 3-28. Assume that the flip-flop in figure 3-30 is 
in the CLEAR state ("1" output is 0 volts, "0" output is high) prior to T0. At T0 a trigger is applied to the 
set input and the flip-flop changes states. Next, the CLEAR input is triggered and the flip-flop returns to 
the CLEAR state at T1. A TOGGLE at T2 causes the flip-flop to change state, so it is once again SET. 
Another TOGGLE changes the flip-flop to the CLEAR state at T3 (notice that TOGGLE triggers flip the 
multivibrator regardless of its previous state). Now, a SET input trigger at T4 sets the flip-flop. The 
CLEAR input pulse at T5 causes the circuit to CLEAR, and the CLEAR input at T6 has no effect on the 
flip-flop, for it is already in the CLEAR state.

instant as source voltage appears across it. As current begins to flow, EL decreases and ER and I increase, 
all at exponential rates. Figure 3-32, view (A), shows these exponential curves. In a time equal to 5 time

RE is small, then the RL circuit has a long time constant. If only a small portion of curve 1 (C to D of

going positive. The positive voltage of L2 is coupled to the base of the transistor through C1, and Q1 
conducts more. This provides more collector current and more current through L1. This action is 
regenerative feedback. Very rapidly, sufficient voltage is applied to saturate the base of Q1. Once the base

</p><p class="paragraph">The operation of the circuit to this point has generated a very steep leading edge for the output pulse. 
Figure 3-34 shows the idealized collector and base waveforms. Once the base of Q1 (figure 3-33) 
becomes saturated, the current increase in L1 is determined by the time constant of L1 and the total series 
resistance. From T0 to T1 in figure 3-34 the current increase (not shown) is approximately linear. The 
voltage across L1 will be a constant value as long as the current increase through L1 is linear. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">At time T1, L1 saturates. At this time, there is no further change in magnetic flux and no coupling 
from L1 to L2. C1, which has charged during time TO to T1, will now discharge through R1 and cut off 
Q1. This causes collector current to stop, and the voltage across L1 returns to 0. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The length of time between T0 and T1 (and T2 to T3 in the next cycle) is the pulse width, which 
depends mainly on the characteristics of the transformer and the point at which the transformer saturates. 
A transformer is chosen that will saturate at about 10 percent of the total circuit current. This ensures that 
the current increase is nearly linear. The transformer controls the pulse width because it controls the slope 
of collector current increase between points T0 and T1. Since TC = L ÷ R , the greater the L, the longer 
the TC. The longer the time constant, the slower the rate of current increase. When the rate of current 
increase is slow, the voltage across L1 is constant for a longer time. This primarily determines the pulse 
width. 
</p><p class="paragraph">From T1 to T2 (figure 3-34), transistor Q1 is held at cutoff by C1 discharging through R1 (figure 
3-33). The transistor is now said to be "blocked." As C1 gradually loses its charge, the voltage on the base 
of Q1 returns to a forward-bias condition. At T2, the voltage on the base has become sufficiently positive 
to forward bias Q1, and the cycle is repeated. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The collector waveform may have an INDUCTIVE OVERSHOOT (PARASITIC OSCILLATIONS) 
at the end of the pulse. When Q1 cuts off, current through L1 ceases, and the magnetic field collapses, 
inducing a positive voltage at the collector of Q1. These oscillations are not desirable, so some means 
must be employed to reduce them. The transformer primary may be designed to have a high dc resistance 
resulting in a low Q; this resistance will decrease the amplitude of the oscillations. However, more 
damping may be necessary than such a low-Q transformer primary alone can achieve. If so, a DAMPING 
resistor can be placed in parallel with L1, as shown in figure 3-35. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

damping resistor R2 is used to adjust the Q which reduces the amplitude of overshoot parasitic 
oscillations. As R2 is varied from infinity toward zero, the decreasing resistance will load the transformer 
to the point that pulse amplitude, pulse width, and prf are affected. If reduced enough, the oscillator will 
cease to function. By varying R2, varying degrees of damping can be achieved, three of which are shown

</h2><p class="paragraph">Radar sets, oscilloscopes, and computer circuits all use sawtooth (voltage or current) waveforms. A 
sawtooth waveshape must have a linear rise. The sawtooth waveform is often used to produce a uniform, 
progressive movement of an electron beam across the face of an electrostatic cathode ray tube. This 
movement of the electron beam is known as a SWEEP. The voltage which causes this movement is 
known as SWEEP VOLTAGE and the circuit which produces this voltage is the SWEEP GENERATOR, 
or TIME-BASE GENERATOR. Most common types of time-base generators develop the sawtooth 
waveform by using some type of switching action with either the charge or discharge of an RC or RL 
circuit. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Sawtooth Wave 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A sawtooth wave can be generated by using an RC network. Possibly the simplest sawtooth 
generator is that which is shown in figure 3-38, view (A). Assume that at T0 (view (B)), S1 is placed in 
position P. At the instant the switch closes, the applied voltage (Ea) appears at R. C begins to charge to E a 
through R. If S1 remains closed long enough, C will fully charge to Ea. You should remember from 
NEETS, Module 2, Alternating Current and Transformers, that a capacitor takes 5 time constants (5TC) 
to fully charge. As the capacitor charges to the applied voltage, the rate of charge follows an exponential 
curve. If a linear voltage is desired, the full charge time of the capacitor cannot be used because the 
exponential curve becomes nonlinear during the first time constant.

</p><p class="paragraph">However, during the first 10 percent of the first time constant, the rate of voltage change across the 
capacitor is almost constant (linear). Suppose that S1 is placed in position P at T0, and C is allowed to 
charge for 0.1 time constant. This is shown as T0 to T1 in view (B). Notice that the rate of voltage change 
across C is nearly constant between T0 and T1. Now, assume that at T1 the switch is moved from position 
P to position Q. This shorts the capacitor, and it discharges very rapidly. If the switch is placed back in 
position P, the capacitor will start charging again. 
</p><p class="paragraph">By selecting the sizes of R and C, you can have a time constant of any value you desire. Further, by 
controlling the time S1 remains closed, you can generate a sawtooth of any duration. Figure 3-39 is the 
Universal Time Constant Chart. Notice in the chart that if 1 time constant is 1,000 microseconds, S1 
(figure 3-38, view (A )) can be closed no longer than 100 microseconds to obtain a reasonable linear 
sawtooth. In this example, C1 will charge to nearly 10 volts in 0.1 time constant. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

any further. Figure 3-40 shows a sawtooth waveform with the various dimensions labeled. The duration 
of the rise of voltage (T0 to T1) is known as the SWEEP TIME or ELECTRICAL LENGTH. The 
electron beam of an oscilloscope moves across the face of the cathode ray tube during this sweep time. 
The amount of voltage rise per unit of time is referred to as the SLOPE of the waveform. The time from 
T1 to T2 is the capacitor discharge time and is known as FALL TIME or FLYBACK TIME. This 
discharge time is known as flyback time because during this period the electron beam returns, or "flys" 
back, from the end of a scanning line to begin the next line. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The amplitude of the rise of voltage is known as the PHYSICAL LENGTH. It is called physical 
length because the greater the peak voltage, the greater physical distance the beam will move. For 
example, the amount of voltage needed to move an electron beam 4 inches is twice the amount needed to 
move the beam 2 inches across the face of a given crt. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltage rise between T0 to T1 is the LINEAR SLOPE of the wave. The linearity of the rise of 
voltage is determined by the amount of time the capacitor is allowed to charge. If the charge time is kept 
short (10 percent or less of 1TC), the linearity is reasonably good. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As stated in the discussion of time-base generators, the waveform produced from any sawtooth 
generator must be linear. A LINEAR SAWTOOTH is one that has an equal change in voltage for an 
equal change in time. Referring to the Universal Time Constant Chart in figure 3-39, you can see that the 
most desirable part of the charge curve is the first one-tenth (0.1) of the first TC. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-41, view (A), is a transistor sawtooth generator. In this figure R1 is a forward-biasing 
resistor for Q1, C1 is a coupling capacitor, and Q1 is serving as a switch for the RC network consisting of 
R2 and C2. With forward bias applied to Q1, the generator conducts at saturation, and its collector voltage 
(the output) is near 0 volts as indicated by the waveform in view (B). The charge felt by C1 is nearly 0. A 
negative gate is applied to the base of Q1 to cut off Q1 and allow C2 to charge. The length of time that the 
gate is negative determines how long Q1 will remain cut off and, in turn, how long C2 will be allowed to 
charge. The length of time that C2 is allowed to charge is referred to as the electrical length of the 
sawtooth that is produced. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

circuit. For example, if the voltage is 30 volts, and the capacitor (C2) is allowed to charge to 10 percent of 
30 volts, then the amplitude of the sawtooth will be 3 volts (see figure 3-41, view (B)). If VCC is increased 
to 40 volts, C2 will charge to 10 percent of 40 volts and the output will increase in amplitude to 4 volts. 
Changing the value of V CC in the circuit changes the amplitude of the sawtooth waveform that is 
produced; amplitude determines the physical length. Since the number of time constants used in the 
circuit has not been changed, linearity does not change with a change in VCC. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The linear slope that is produced by the circuit is dependent on two variables; (1) the time constant 
of the RC circuit and (2) the gate length of the gate applied to the circuit. The circuit will produce a linear 
sawtooth waveshape if the components selected are such that only one-tenth of 1 TC or less is used. The 
GATE LENGTH is the amount of time that the gate is applied to the circuit and controls the time that the

</p><p class="paragraph">UNIJUNCTION SAWTOOTH GENERATOR.—So far, you have learned in this chapter that a 
switch and an RC network can generate a sawtooth waveform. When using a unijunction transistor as the 
switch, a simple sawtooth generator looks like the circuit in figure 3-44, view (A); the output waveshapes 
are shown in view (B). You may want to review unijunction transistors in NEETS, Module 7, 
Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, chapter 3, before continuing. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the 20 volts is applied across B2 and B1, the n-type bar acts as a voltage- divider. A voltage of 
12.8 volts appears at a point near the emitter. At the first instant, C1 has no voltage across it, so the output 
of the circuit, which is taken across the capacitor (C1), is equal to 0 volts. (The voltage across C1 is also 
the voltage that is applied to the emitter of the unijunction.) The unijunction is now reverse biased. After 
T0, C1 begins to charge toward 20 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T1, the voltage across the capacitor (the voltage on the emitter) has reached approximately 12.8 
volts. This is the peak point for the unijunction, and it now becomes forward biased. With the emitter 
forward biased, the impedance between the emitter and B1 is just a few ohms. This is similar to placing a 
short across the capacitor. The capacitor discharges very rapidly through the low resistance of B1 to E. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As C1 discharges, the voltage from the emitter to B1 also decreases. Q1 will continue to be forward 
biased as long as the voltage across C1 is larger than the valley point of the unijunction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T2 the 3-volt valley point of the unijunction has been reached. The emitter now becomes reverse 
biased and the impedance from the emitter to B1 returns to a high value. Immediately after T2, Q1 is 
reverse biased and the capacitor has a charge of approximately 3 volts. C1 now starts to charge toward 20 
volts as it did originally (just after T0). This is shown from T2 to T3 in figure 3-44, view (B). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

RC times the number of time constants. Refer to the Universal Time Constant Chart (figure 3-39) again to 
find that 57 percent is 0.83TC. By multiplying 0.83 times R1C1, you will find that the electrical length is 
approximately 21 milliseconds: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The physical length (amplitude) is determined by subtracting the valley point from the peak point. 
This is 9.8 volts in the example (12.8 volts − 3 volts). 
</p><p class="paragraph">For a sweep generator that produces a more linear output sawtooth waveform, refer to the circuit in 
figure 3-45, view (A). R1 and C1 form the RC time constant. Notice that the capacitor charges toward 35

amounts to 0.1 time constant. The electrical length is, again, RC times the number of time constants. With 
R1 at 300 kilohms and C1 at .005 microfarads, the time constant is 1,500 microseconds. One-tenth of a 
time constant is equal to 150 microseconds; so the electrical length is 150 microseconds. Prt is the 
electrical length plus the fall or flyback time. If C1 discharges from 5.3 volts to 2 volts in 15

</p><p class="paragraph">Some unijunction circuits are triggered to obtain a very stable prf. One method is to apply triggers to 
B2, as shown in figure 3-46. Negative triggers applied to B2 reduce the inter-base voltage enough to 
cause a forward bias condition in the emitter circuit. This cuts off the sweep and allows C1 to discharge 
through the B1-to-emitter circuit. Then, C1 recharges until the next trigger arrives and C1 discharges. 
Circuit operation and parameters are figured in the same manner as in the previous sawtooth circuits.

</p><p class="paragraph">Since Q1 is a pnp transistor, a positive voltage must be used to drive it to cutoff. Figure 3-47, view 
(B), shows a rectangular wave input 500 microseconds long on the positive alternation. At T0, the 
positive gate applied to the base of Q1 cuts off Q1. This effectively removes the transistor from the circuit 
(opens the switch), and C1 charges through R3 toward 20 volts. Starting with a charge of −2.5 volts at T0, 
C1 charges (T0 to T1) for 500 microseconds to -4.25 volts at T1. Let's determine the percent of charge: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">This allows nearly a linear rise of voltage across C1. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Increasing the value of R3 or C1 increases the time constant. The capacitor will not charge to as high 
a voltage in the same period of time. Decreasing the width of the gate and maintaining the same time 
constant also prevents the capacitor from charging as much. With less charge on the capacitor, and the 
same voltage applied, linearity has been improved. Decreasing R3 or C1 or increasing gate width 
decreases linearity. Changing the applied voltage will change the charge on the capacitor. The percentage 
of charge remains constant; however, it does not affect linearity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T1, the positive alternation of the input gate ends, and Q1 returns to a forward-bias condition. A 
transistor that is near saturation has very low resistance, so C1 discharges rapidly between T1 and T2, as 
shown in figure 3-47, view (C). The capacitor discharges in less than 200 microseconds, the length of the 
negative alternation of the gate. The negative gate is made longer than the discharge time of the capacitor 
to ensure that the circuit has returned to its original condition. 
</p><p class="paragraph">From T1 to T2, the capacitor discharges and the circuit returns to its original condition, ready for 
another positive gate to arrive. The next positive gate arrives at T2 and the actions repeats. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The amplitude of the output sawtooth wave is equal to 1.75 volts (4.25 volts minus 2.5 volts). The 
electrical length is the same as the positive alternation of the input gate, or 500 microseconds. The prt is 
700 microseconds (500 + 200) and the prf is 1/prt or 1,428 hertz. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Trapezoidal Sweep Generator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Normally, oscilloscopes and synchroscopes use ELECTROSTATIC DEFLECTION and, as the 
name implies, electrostatic fields move the electron beam. The need here is for a sawtooth voltage 
waveform. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another method of electron beam deflection is ELECTROMAGNETIC DEFLECTION. Currents 
through a coil produce electromagnetic fields which position the beam of electrons. The electromagnetic 
system requires a sawtooth of current which increases at a linear rate. Because of the inherent 
characteristics of a coil, a sawtooth voltage does not cause a linear increase of current. A linear increase 
of current requires a TRAPEZOIDAL voltage waveform applied to a coil. This section discusses the 
generation of a trapezoidal wave. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-48 shows a trapezoidal wave. The wave consists of a sharp, almost instantaneous jump in 
voltage followed by a linear rise to some peak value. The initial change in voltage at T0 is called a JUMP 
or STEP. The jump is followed by a linear sawtooth voltage rise. The time from the jump to the peak 
amplitude is the sum of the jump voltage and the sawtooth peak; where the peak value occurs is the 
electrical length. The peak voltage amplitude is the sum of the jump voltage and the sawtooth peak 
voltage. The waveshape can be considered a combination of a rectangular wave and a sawtooth wave. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The inductance and resistance of a coil form a series RL circuit. The voltage drop across this 
inductance and resistance must be added to obtain the voltage waveform required to produce a linear rise 
in current. A linear rise of current produces a linear rise of voltage across the resistance of the coil and a 
constant voltage drop across the inductance of the coil. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume figure 3-49, view (A), represents deflection coils. If we apply a voltage waveshape to the 
circuit, which will provide a square wave across inductor L, and a sawtooth across resistor R, then a linear 
current rise will result. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">View (B) of figure 3-49 shows the waveforms when Ea is a square wave. Recall that the inductor  
acts as an open circuit at this first instant. Current now starts to flow and develops a voltage across the 
resistor. With a square wave applied, the voltage across the inductor starts to drop as soon as any voltage 
appears across the resistor. This is due to the fact that the voltage across the inductor and resistor must 
add up to the applied voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">With Ea being a trapezoidal voltage, as shown in figure 3-49, view (C), the instant current flows, a 
voltage appears across the resistor, and the applied voltage increases. With an increasing applied voltage, 
the inductor voltage remains constant (EL) at the jump level and circuit current (I R) rises at a linear rate 
from the jump voltage point. Notice that if you add the inductor voltage (EL) and resistor voltage (ER) at 
any point between times T0 and T1, the sum is the applied voltage (Ea). The key fact here is that a 
trapezoidal voltage must be applied to a sweep coil to cause a linear rise of current. The linear rise of 
current will cause a uniform, changing magnetic field which, in turn, will cause an electron beam to move 
at a constant rate across a crt.

</p><p class="paragraph">There are many ways to generate a trapezoidal waveshape. For example, the rectangular part could 
be generated in one circuit, the sawtooth portion in another, and the two combined waveforms in still a 
third circuit. A far easier, and less complex, way is to use an RC circuit in combination with a transistor to 
generate the trapezoidal waveshape in one stage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-50, view (A), shows the schematic diagram of a trapezoidal generator. The waveshapes for 
the circuit are shown in view (B). R1 provides forward bias for Q1 and, without an input gate, Q1 
conducts very hard (near saturation), C1 couples the input gate signal to the base of Q1. R2, R3, and C2 
form the RC network which forms the trapezoidal wave. The output is taken across R3 and C2.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">With Q1 conducting very hard, collector voltage is near 0 volts prior to the gate being applied. The 
voltage across R2 is about 50 volts. This means no current flows across R3, and C2 has no charge. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T0, the negative alternation of the input gate is applied to the base of Q1, driving it into cutoff. At 
this time the transistor is effectively removed from the circuit. The circuit is now a series-RC network 
with 50 volts applied. At the instant Q1 cuts off, 50 volts will appear across the combination of R2 and 
R3 (the capacitor being a short at the first instant). The 50 volts will divide proportionally, according to 
the size of the two resistors. R2 then will have 49.5 volts and R3 will have 0.5 volt. The 0.5 volt across 
R3 (jump resistor) is the amplitude of the jump voltage. Since the output is taken across R3 and C2 in 
series, the output "jumps" to 0.5 volt. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Observe how a trapezoidal generator differs from a sawtooth generator. If the output were taken 
across the capacitor alone, the output voltage would be 0 at the first instant. But splitting the R of the RC 
network so that the output is taken across the capacitor and part of the total resistance produces the jump 
voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Refer again to figure 3-50, view (A) and view (B). From T0 to T1, C2 begins charging toward 50 
volts through R2 and R3. The time constant for this circuit is 10 milliseconds. If the input gate is 1,000 
microseconds, the capacitor can charge for only 10 percent of 1TC, and the sawtooth part of the 
trapezoidal wave will be linear. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T1, the input gate ends and Q1 begins to conduct heavily. C2 discharges through R3 and Q1. The 
time required to discharge C2 is primarily determined by the values of R3 and C2. The minimum 
discharge time (in this circuit) is 500 microseconds (5KΩ × .02µF × 5). At T2, the capacitor has 
discharged back to 0 volts and the circuit is quiescent. It remains in this condition until T3 when another 
gate is applied to the transistor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The amplitude of the jump voltage was calculated to be 0.5 volt. The sawtooth portion of the wave is 
linear because the time, T0 to T1, is only 10 percent of the total charge time. The amplitude of the 
trapezoidal wave is approximately 5 volts. The electrical length is the same as the input gate length, or 
1,000 microseconds. Linearity is affected in the same manner as in the sawtooth generator. Increasing R2 
or C2, or decreasing gate width, will improve linearity. Changing the applied voltage will increase output 
amplitude, but will not affect linearity. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Linearity of the trapezoidal waveform, produced by the circuit in figure 3-50, view (A) and view (B) 
depends on two factors, gate length and the time constant of the RC circuit. Recall that these are the same 
factors that controlled linearity in the sawtooth generator. The formula developed earlier still remains true 
and enables us to determine what effect these factors have on linearity. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">An increase in gate length results in an increase in the number of time constants and an increase in 
the percentage of charge that the capacitor will take on during this time interval. As stated earlier, if the 
number of time constants were to exceed 0.1, linearity would decrease. The reason for a decrease in 
linearity is that a greater percentage of VCC is used. The Universal Time Constant Chart (figure 3-39) 
shows that the charge line begins to curve. A decrease in gate length has the opposite effect on linearity in 
that it causes linearity to increase. The reason for this increase is that a smaller number of time constants 
are used and, in turn, a smaller percentage of the applied VCC is used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Changing the value of resistance or capacitance in the circuit also affects linearity. If the value of C2 
or R3 is increased, the time is increased for 1 time constant. An increase in the time for 1TC results in a 
decrease in the number of time constants required for good linearity. As stated earlier, a decrease in the 
number of time constants results in an increase in linearity (less than 0.1TC). In addition to an increase in 
jump voltage (larger value of R3) and a decrease in the amplitude (physical length) of the sawtooth 
produced by the circuit, electrical length remains the same because the length of the gate was not 
changed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">R2 has a similar effect on linearity because it is in series with R3. As an example, decreasing the 
value of R2 results in a decrease in linearity. The equation 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">illustrates that by decreasing R (TC = RC), TC decreases and an increase in the number of time constants 
causes a decrease in linearity. Other effects are an increase in jump voltage and an increase in the 
amplitude (physical length) of the sawtooth. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Changing the value of VCC does not affect linearity. Linearity is dependent on gate length, R, and C. 
VCC does affect the amplitude of the waveform and the value of jump voltage that is obtained. 
</p><p class="question">Q11. For an RC circuit to produce a linear output across the capacitor, the voltage across the 
capacitor may not exceed what percent of the applied voltage? 
</p><p class="question">Q12. Increasing gate length in a sawtooth generator does what to linearity? 
</p><p class="question">Q13. In a sawtooth generator, why is the transistor turned on for a longer time than the discharge time 
of the RC network? 
</p><p class="question">Q14. What is added to a sawtooth generator to produce a trapezoidal wave?

</h2><p class="paragraph">As a technician, you will be confronted with many different types of LIMITING circuits. A 
LIMITER is defined as a device which limits some part of a waveform from exceeding a specified value. 
Limiting circuits are used primarily for wave shaping and circuit-protection applications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A limiter is little more than the half-wave rectifier you studied in NEETS, Module 6, Introduction to 
Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies. By using a diode, a resistor, and sometimes a dc bias 
voltage, you can build a limiter that will eliminate the positive or negative alternations of an input 
waveform. Such a circuit can also limit a portion of the alternations to a specific voltage level. In this 
chapter you will be introduced to five types of limiters: SERIES-POSITIVE, SERIES-NEGATIVE, 
PARALLEL-POSITIVE, PARALLEL-NEGATIVE, and DUAL-DIODE LIMITERS. Both series- and 
parallel-positive and negative limiters use biasing to obtain certain wave shapes. They will be discussed in 
this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The diode in these circuits is the voltage-limiting component. Its polarity and location, with respect 
to ground, are the factors that determine circuit action. In series limiters, the diode is in series with the 
output. In parallel limiters, the diode is in parallel with the output.

figure 4-1. The input signal is applied across the diode and resistor and the output is taken across the 
resistor. The series-limiter circuit can limit either the positive or negative alternation, depending on the 
polarity of the diode connection with respect to ground. The circuit shown in figure 4-1, view (B), is a 
SERIES-POSITIVE LIMITER. Reversing D1 would change the circuit to a SERIES-NEGATIVE 
LIMITER.

the diode to make the diode conduct. When the positive alternation of the input signal (T0 to T1) is 
applied to the circuit, the cathode is positive with respect to the anode. The diode is reverse biased and

limited portion removed. When the diode is reverse biased, the circuit has a small amount of reverse 
current flow, as shown just above the 0-volt reference line in figure 4-2. During the limiting portion of the 
input signal, the diode resistance should be high compared to the resistor. During the time the diode is 
conducting, the resistance of the diode should be small as compared to that of the resistor. In other words, 
the diode should have a very high front-to-back ratio (forward resistance compared to reverse resistance). 
This relationship can be better understood if you study the effects that a front-to-back resistance ratio has 
on circuit output.

resistor R1 and battery voltage is felt at point (B). The diode will remain reverse biased until the positive 
alternation of the input signal decreases to just under +5 volts at T2. At this time, the diode again becomes 
forward biased and conducts. The diode will remain forward biased from T2 to T3. During this period the

</h2><p class="paragraph">Series RC circuits are widely used for coupling signals from one stage to another. If the time 
constant of the coupling circuit is comparatively long, the shape of the output waveform will be almost 
identical to that of the input. However, the output dc reference level may be different from that of the 
input. Figure 4-17, view (A), shows a typical RC coupling circuit in which the output reference level has 
been changed to 0 volts. In this circuit, the values of R1 and C1 are chosen so that the capacitor will 
charge (during T0 to T1) to 20 percent of the applied voltage, as shown in view (B). With this in mind, 
let's consider the operation of the circuit.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T0 the input voltage is −50 volts and the capacitor begins charging. At the first instant the voltage 
across C is 0 and the voltage across R is −50 volts. As C charges, its voltage increases. The voltage across 
R, which is the output voltage, begins to drop as the voltage across C increases. At T1 the capacitor has 
charged to 20 percent of the −50 volts input, or −10 volts. Because the input voltage is now 0 volts, the 
capacitor must discharge. It discharges through the low impedance of the signal source and through R, 
developing +10 volts across R at the first instant. C discharges 20 percent of the original 10-volt charge 
from T1 to T2. Thus, C discharges to +8 volts and the output voltage also drops to 8 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T2 the input signal becomes −50 volts again. This −50 volts is in series opposition to the 8-volt 
charge on the capacitor. Thus, the voltage across R totals −42 volts (−50 plus +8 volts). Notice that this 
value of voltage (−42 volts) is smaller in amplitude than the amplitude of the output voltage which 
occurred at TO (−50 volts). Capacitor C now charges from +8 to +16 volts. If we were to continue to 
follow the operation of the circuit, we would find that the output wave shape would become exactly 
distributed around the 0-volt reference point. At that time the circuit operation would have reached a 
stable operating point. Note that the output wave shape has the same amplitude and approximately the 
same shape as the input wave shape, but now "rides" equally above and below 0 volts. Clampers use this 
RC time so that the input and output waveforms will be almost identical, as shown from T11 to T12.

charged it acts as a voltage source. The input wave shape shown in view (B) is a square wave and varies 
between +25 volts and −25 volts. Compare each portion of the input wave shape with the corresponding 
output wave shape. Keep Kirchhoff's law in mind: The algebraic sum of the voltage drops around a closed

The initial voltage across R1 and D1 causes a voltage spike in the output. Because the charge time of C1 
through D1 is almost instantaneous, the duration of the pulse is so short that it has only a negligible effect 
on the output. The −25 volts across D1 makes the cathode negative with respect to the anode and the 
diode conducts heavily. C1 quickly charges through the small resistance of D1. As the voltage across C1 
increases, the output voltage decreases at the same rate. The voltage across C1 reaches -25 volts and the 
output is at 0 volts. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">At T1 the +25 volts already across the capacitor and the +25 volts from the input signal are in series 
and aid each other (SERIES AIDING). Thus, +50 volts appears across R1 and D1. At this time, the 
cathode of D1 is positive with respect to the anode, and the diode does not conduct. From T1 to T2, C1 
discharges to approximately +23 volts (because of the large values of R and C) and the output voltage 
drops from +50 volts to +48 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T2 the input signal changes from +25 volts to −25 volts. The input is now SERIES OPPOSING 
with the +23 volts across C1. This leaves an output voltage of −2 volts (−25 plus +23 volts). The cathode 
of D1 is negative with respect to the anode and D1 conducts. From T2 to T3, C1 quickly charges through 
D1 from +23 volts to +25 volts; the output voltage changes from −2 volts to 0 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T3 the input signal and capacitor voltage are again series aiding. Thus, the output voltage felt 
across R1 and D1 is again +50 volts. During T3 and T4, C1 discharges 2 volts through R1. Notice that 
circuit operation from T3 to T4 is the same as it was from T1 to T2. The circuit operation for each square-
wave cycle repeats the operation which occurred from T2 to T4. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Compare the input wave shape of figure 4-18, view (B), with the output wave shape. Note the 
following important points: (1) The peak-to-peak amplitude of the input wave shape has not been changed 
by the clamper circuit; (2) the shape of the output wave shape has not been significantly changed from 
that of the input by the action of the clamper circuit; and (3) the output wave shape is now all above 0 
volts whereas the input wave shape is both above and below 0 volts. Thus, the lower part of the input 
wave shape has been clamped to a dc potential of 0 volts in the output. This circuit is referred to as a 
positive clamper since all of the output wave shape is above 0 volts and the bottom is clamped at 0 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The positive clamper circuit is self-adjusting. This means that the bottom of the output waveform 
remains clamped at 0 volts during changes in input signal amplitude. Also, the output wave shape retains 
the form and peak-to-peak amplitude (50 volts in this case) of the input wave shape. When the input 
amplitude becomes greater, the charge of the capacitor becomes greater and the output amplitude 
becomes larger. When the input amplitude decreases, the capacitor does not charge as high as before and 
clamping occurs at a lower output voltage. The capacitor charge, therefore, changes with signal strength. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The size of R1 and C1 has a direct effect upon the operation of the clamper. Because of the small 
resistance of the diode, the capacitor charge time is short. If either R1 or C1 is made smaller, the capacitor 
discharges faster (TC = R · C). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ability of a smaller value capacitor to quickly discharge to a lower voltage is an advantage when 
the amplitude of the input wave shape is suddenly reduced. However, for normal clamper operation, quick 
discharge time is a disadvantage. This is because one objective of clamping is to keep the output wave 
shape the same as the input wave shape. If the small capacitor allows a relatively large amount of the 
voltage to discharge with each cycle, then distortion occurs in the output wave shape. A larger portion of 
the wave shape then appears on the wrong side of the reference line. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Increasing the value of the resistor increases the discharge time (again, TC = R · C). This increased 
value causes the capacitor to discharge more slowly and produces an output wave shape which is a better 
reproduction of the input wave shape. A disadvantage of increasing the resistance value is that the larger 
resistance increases the discharge time of the capacitor and slows the self-adjustment rate of the circuit, 
particularly in case a sudden decrease in input amplitude should occur. The larger resistance has no effect 
on self-adjustment with a sudden rise in input amplitude. This is because the capacitor charges through 
the small resistance of the conducting diode. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

hold this charge until the first pulse is applied. The battery establishes the dc reference level at +10 volts. 
The input wave shape at the top of view (B) is a square wave which alternates between +25 and −25 volts. 
The output wave shape is shown at the bottom half of view (B). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Here, as with previous circuits, let's apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to determine circuit operation. 
With no input signal, the output is just the +10 volts supplied by the battery. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At time T0 the −25 volt signal applied to the circuit is instantly felt across R1 and D1. The −25 volt 
input signal forward biases D1, and C1 quickly charges to 35 volts. This leaves +10 volts across the 
output terminals for much of the period from T0 to T1. The polarity of the charged capacitor is, from the 
left to the right, minus to plus. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T1 the 35 volts across the capacitor is series aiding with the +25 volt input signal. At this point 
(T1) the output voltage becomes +60 volts; the voltage across R1 and D1 is +50 volts, and the battery is 
+10 volts. The cathode of D1 is positive with respect to the anode and the diode does not conduct. From 
T1 to T2, C1 discharges only slightly through the large resistance of R1. Assume that, because of the size 
of R1 and C1, the capacitor discharges just 2 volts (from +35 volts to +33 volts) during this period. Thus, 
the output voltage drops from +60 volts to +58 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T2 the −25 volt input signal and the +33 volts across C1 are series opposing. This makes the 
voltage across the output terminals +8 volts. The cathode of the diode is 2 volts negative with respect to 
its anode and D1 conducts. Again, since the forward-biased diode is essentially a short, C1 quickly 
charges from +33 volts to +35 volts. During most of the time from T2 to T3, then, we find the output 
voltage is +10 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T3 the +25 volts of the input signal is series aiding with the +35 volts across C1. Again the output 
voltage is +60 volts. Observe that at T3 the conditions in the circuit are the same as they were at T1. 
Therefore, the circuit operation from T3 to T4 is the same as it was from T1 to T2. Circuit operation 
continues as a duplication of the operations which occurred from T1 to T3. 
</p><p class="paragraph">By comparing the input and output wave shapes, you should note the following: (1) The peak-to-
peak amplitude of the input wave shape has not been changed in the output (for all practical purposes) by 
the action of the clamper circuit; (2) the shape of the input wave has not been changed; (3) the output 
wave shape is now clamped above +10 volts. Remember that this clamping level (+10 volts) is 
determined by the bias battery. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Positive-Diode Clamper With Negative Bias

the capacitor charges through R1 to the bias battery voltage; the output voltage equals −10 volts. The 
circuit has negative bias because the positive side of the battery is grounded. The output waveform is 
shown in view (B). Study the figure and waveforms carefully and note the following important points. 
Once again the peak-to-peak amplitude and shape of the output wave are, for all practical purposes, the 
same as the input wave. The lower extremity of the output wave is clamped to −10 volts, the value of the 
battery. Let's look at the circuit operation. The capacitor is initially charged to −10 volts with no input

discharge through R1 (very large) is almost negligible. The output voltage is equal to the algebraic sum of 
the capacitor voltage and the input voltage. The +25 volt input signal added to the −15 volt capacitor

C 1 adds to the input voltage to provide a −40 volt output. From T1 to T2, the capacitor loses only a small

discussion. 
</p><p class="paragraph">From T0 to T1 the output follows the input because of the increasing emitter-base forward bias. 
However, at T1 the collector voltage reaches −2 volts and D2 is forward biased. D2 conducts and limits 
the output to −2 volts (the value of B3). D2 conducts until T2 when the input decreases below −2 volts. At 
this time, D2 cuts off and the output again follows the input because of the decreasing forward bias on 
Q1. At T3 the input reaches −8 volts and forward biases D1. D1 conducts and any further increase 
(beyond −8 volts) of the input has no effect on the output. When the input returns to a value more positive 
than −8 volts, D1 cuts off and the output again follows the input. This circuit action is the same for all

waveform that is not a pure sine wave consists of two or more sine waves. Adding the correct frequencies 
at the proper phase and amplitude will form square waves, sawtooth waves, and other nonsinusoidal 
waveforms. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A waveform other than a sine wave is called a COMPLEX WAVE. You will see that a complex 
wave consists of a fundamental frequency plus one or more HARMONIC frequencies. The shape of a 
nonsinusoidal waveform is dependent upon the type of harmonics present as part of the waveform, their 
relative amplitudes, and their relative phase relationships. In general, the steeper the sides of a waveform, 
that is, the more rapid its rise and fall, the more harmonics it contains. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The sine wave which has the lowest frequency in the complex periodic wave is referred to as the 
FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY. The type and number of harmonics included in the waveform are 
dependent upon the shape of the waveform. Harmonics have two classifications — EVEN numbered and 
ODD numbered. Harmonics are always a whole number of times higher than the fundamental frequency 
and are designated by an integer (whole number). For example, the frequency twice as high as the 
fundamental frequency is the SECOND HARMONIC (or the first even harmonic). 
</p><p class="paragraph">View (A) of figure 4-25 compares a square wave with sine waves. Sine wave K is the same 
frequency as the square wave (its fundamental frequency). If another sine wave (L) of smaller amplitude

produced. The addition of these two waveforms is accomplished by adding the instantaneous values of 
both sine waves algebraically. Curve M is called the resultant. Notice that curve M begins to assume the

still steeper. The addition of more odd harmonics will bring the composite waveform nearer the shape of 
the perfect square wave. A perfect square wave is, therefore, composed of an infinite number of odd

drop across the capacitor. To high frequencies, the reactance of the capacitor will be extremely small, 
causing a small voltage drop across the capacitor. This is no different than was the case for low- and high-
pass filters (discriminators) presented in chapter 1. If the voltage component of the harmonic is not 
developed across the reactance of the capacitor, it will be developed across the resistor, if we observe 
Kirchhoff's voltage law. The harmonic amplitude and phase relationship across the capacitor is not the 
same as that of the original frequency input; therefore, a perfect square wave will not be produced across 
the capacitor. You should remember that the reactance offered to each harmonic frequency will cause a 
change in both the amplitude and phase of each of the individual harmonic frequencies with respect to the

majority of the output voltage will not be developed across the output capacitor. Rather, most of the

of the waveform developed across the capacitor to be rounded. An example of this effect is shown in

further decreased. This means that even fewer harmonics will be developed across the capacitor.

such that at the first instant of time in which voltage is applied, current flow through the inductor is 
minimum and the voltage developed across it is maximum. Therefore, the value of the voltage drop across 
the series resistor at that first instant must be 0 volts because there is no current flow through it. As time 
passes, current begins to flow through the circuit and voltage develops across the resistor. Since the 
circuit has a long time constant, the voltage across the resistor does NOT respond to the rapid changes in

passed, the capacitor voltage varies by equal amounts above and below the 50-volt level. The resistor 
voltage varies by equal amounts both above and below a 0-volt level. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The RC networks which have been discussed in this chapter may also be used as coupling networks. 
When an RC circuit is used as a coupling circuit, the output is taken from across the resistor. Normally, a 
long time-constant circuit is used. This, of course, will cause an integrated wave shape across the 
capacitor if the applied signal is nonsinusoidal. However, in a coupling circuit, the signal across the 
resistor should closely resemble the input signal and will if the time constant is sufficiently long. By 
referring to the diagram in figure 4-42, you can see that the voltage across the resistor closely resembles 
the input signal. Consider what would happen if a pure sine wave were applied to a long time-constant 
RC circuit (R is much greater than XC). A large percentage of the applied voltage would be developed 
across the resistor and only a small amount across the capacitor.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Positive Counters 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The POSITIVE-DIODE COUNTER circuit is used in timing or counting circuits in which the 
number of input pulses are represented by the output voltage. The output may indicate frequency, count 
the rpm of a shaft, or register a number of operations. The counter establishes a direct relationship 
between the input frequency and the average dc output voltage. As the input frequency increases, the 
output voltage also increases; conversely, as the input frequency decreases, the output voltage decreases. 
In effect, the positive counter counts the number of positive input pulses by producing an average dc 
output voltage proportional to the repetition frequency of the input signal. For accurate counting, the 
pulse repetition frequency must be the only variable parameter in the input signal. Therefore, careful 
shaping and limiting of the input signal is essential for you to ensure that the pulses are of uniform width 
and that the amplitude is constant. When properly filtered and smoothed, the dc output voltage of the 
counter may be used to operate a direct reading indicator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Solid-state and electron-tube counters operate in manners similar to each other. The basic solid-state 
(diode) counter circuit is shown in view (A) of figure 4-43. Capacitor C1 is the input coupling capacitor. 
Resistor R1 is the load resistor across which the output voltage is developed. For the purpose of circuit 
discussion, assume that the input pulses (shown in view (B)) are of constant amplitude and time duration 
and that only the pulse repetition frequency changes. At time T0, the positive-going input pulse is applied 
to C1 and causes the anode of D2 to become positive. D2 conducts and current ic flows through R1 and 
D2 to charge C1. Current ic, develops an output voltage across R1, shown as eout.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The initial heavy flow of current produces a large voltage across R1 which tapers off exponentially 
as C1 charges. The charge on C1 is determined by the time constant of R1 and the conducting resistance 
of the diode times the capacitance of C1. For ease of explanation, assume that C1 is charged to the peak 
value before T1. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T1 the input signal reverses polarity and becomes negative-going. Although the charge on 
capacitor C1 cannot change instantly, the applied negative voltage is equal to or greater than the charge 
on C1. This causes the anode of D2 to become negative and conduction ceases. When D2 stops 
conducting e out is at 0. C1 quickly discharges through D1 since its cathode is now negative with respect to 
ground. Between T1 and T2 the input pulse is again at the 0-volt level and D2 remains in a nonconducting 
state. Since the very short time constant provided by the conduction resistance of D1 and C1 is so much 
less than the long time constant offered by D2 and R1 during the conduction period, C1 is always 
completely discharged between pulses. Thus, for each input pulse, a precise level of charge is deposited 
on C1. For each charge of C1 an identical output pulse is produced by the flow of ic through R1. Since 
this current flow always occurs in the direction indicated by the solid arrow, the dc output voltage is 
positive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T2 the input signal again becomes positive and the cycle repeats. The time duration between 
pulses is the interval represented by the period between T1 and T2 or between T3 and T4. If the input-
pulse frequency is reduced, these time periods become longer. On the other hand, if the frequency is 
increased, these time intervals become shorter. With shorter periods, more pulses occur in a given length 
of time and a higher average dc output voltage is produced; with longer periods, fewer pulses occur and a 
lower average dc output voltage is produced. Thus, the dc output is directly proportional to the repetition 
frequency of the input pulses. If the current and voltage are sufficiently large, a direct-reading meter can 
be used to indicate the count. If they are not large enough to actuate a meter directly, a dc amplifier may 
be added. In the latter case, a pi-type filter network is inserted at the output of R1 to absorb the 
instantaneous pulse variations and produce a smooth direct current for amplification. 
</p><p class="paragraph">From the preceding discussion, you should see that the voltage across the output varies in direct 
proportion to the input pulse repetition rate. Hence, if the repetition rate of the incoming pulses increases, 
the voltage across R1 also increases. For the circuit to function as a frequency counter, some method must </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

by C2, R2, and C3. The positive dc voltage from the filter is applied to the input of amplifier A. This

emitter or cathode current flows through M1, an increase in amplifier current causes an increase in meter 
deflection. The meter may be calibrated in units of time, frequency, revolutions per minute, or any 
function based upon the relationship of output voltage to input frequency.

</h3><p class="paragraph">Reversing the connections of diodes D1 and D2 in the positive-counter circuit (view (A) of figure 4-
43) will cause the circuit to respond to negative pulses and become a negative-counter circuit. Diode D2 
conducts during the time the negative pulse is applied and current flows in the opposite direction through 
R1, as was indicated by the arrow. At the end of the negative pulse, D1 conducts and discharges C1. The 
current through R1 increases with an increase in pulse frequency as before. However, if the voltage 
developed across R1 is applied to the same control circuit, as shown in view (A) of figure 4-44, the 
increase in current will be in a negative direction and the amplifier will conduct less. Thus, the effect is

</p><p class="paragraph">A schematic diagram of a positive step counter is shown in view (A) of figure 4-45. For step 
counting, the load resistor of the positive-counting circuit is replaced by capacitor C2. This capacitor is 
relatively large in comparison to C1. Each time D2 conducts, the charge on C2 increases as shown in 
view (B). The steps are not the same height each time. They decrease exponentially with time as the 
voltage across C2 approaches the input voltage.

</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit in figure 4-46, (view A) and (view B), may be used as a frequency divider. When used in 
this manner, Q1 is used as a single-swing blocking oscillator that is triggered when the voltage across C2

times larger than C1 and the peak voltage is 10 volts. C1 will assume 9/10 of the positive input voltage at

direction and D2 will be cut off. The cathode of D1 will become more negative than its anode and 
conduct, discharging C1. The charge on C2 will remain at 1 volt because it has no discharge path. At T2 
the second pulse will be applied. The 1-volt charge on C2 will oppose the 10 volts of the second pulse, 
and the applied voltage for the capacitors to charge will be 9 volts. C2 will again charge 10 percent, or 0.9 
volt. This is in addition to the initial charge of volt. At the end of the second pulse, the voltage on C2 will

voltage on C2 will become 1 + .9 + .81, or 2.71 volts. Successive input pulses will raise C2 by 10 percent 
of the remaining voltage toward 10 volts until the blocking oscillator works. If the oscillator bias is set so 
that Q1 begins conduction at 3.8 volts, this will continue until 3.8 volts is exceeded. Since the fourth step 
is 3.5 volts and the fifth is 4.1 volts, the 3.8-volt level is crossed at the fifth step. If the oscillator goes 
through 1 cycle of operation every fifth step and C2 is discharged at this point, this circuit would be a 5-
to-1 divider. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit can be made to divide by 3, 4, or some other value by setting the bias at a different level. 
For example, if the bias is set at 2.9 volts, conduction will occur at the fourth step, making it a 4-to-1 
divider. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The counting stability of the step counter is dependent upon the exponential charging rate of 
capacitor C2. As C2 increases to higher steps, the voltage increments are less and less. If the ratio 
becomes too great, the higher steps become almost indiscernible. For this reason, accuracy decreases as 
the ratio increases. When you desire to count by a large number, 24 for example, a 6-to-1 counter and a 4-
to-1 counter are connected in cascade (series). A more stable method of counting 24 would be to use a 
2:1, 3:1, 4:1 counter connected in cascade. Most step counters operate on a ratio of 5 to 1 or less.
