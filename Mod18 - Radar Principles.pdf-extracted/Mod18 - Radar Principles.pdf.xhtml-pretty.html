SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current

</h2><p class="paragraph">The term RADAR is common in today’s everyday language. You probably use it yourself when
referring to a method of recording the speed of a moving object. The term Radar is an acronym made up
of the words radio detection and ranging. The term is used to refer to electronic equipment that detect the
presence, direction, height, and distance of objects by using reflected electromagnetic energy.
Electromagnetic energy of the frequency used for radar is unaffected by darkness and also penetrates
weather to some degree, depending on frequency. It permits radar systems to determine the positions of
ships, planes, and land masses that are invisible to the naked eye because of distance, darkness, or
weather.
</p><p class="paragraph">The development of radar into the highly complex systems in use today represents the accumulated
developments of many people and nations. The general principles of radar have been known for a long
time, but many electronics discoveries were necessary before a useful radar system could be developed.
World War II provided a strong incentive to develop practical radar, and early versions were in use soon
after the war began. Radar technology has improved in the years since the war. We now have radar
systems that are smaller, more efficient, and better than those early versions.
</p><p class="paragraph">Modern radar systems are used for early detection of surface or air objects and provide extremely
accurate information on distance, direction, height, and speed of the objects. Radar is also used to guide
missiles to targets and direct the firing of gun systems. Other types of radar provide long-distance
surveillance and navigation information.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The electronics principle on which radar operates is very similar to the principle of sound-wave
reflection. If you shout in the direction of a sound-reflecting object (like a rocky canyon or cave), you will
hear an echo. If you know the speed of sound in air, you can then estimate the distance and general
direction of the object. The time required for a return echo can be roughly converted to distance if the
speed of sound is known. Radar uses electromagnetic energy pulses in much the same way, as shown in
figure 1-1. The radio-frequency (rf) energy is transmitted to and reflects from the reflecting object. A
small portion of the energy is reflected and returns to the radar set. This returned energy is called an
ECHO, just as it is in sound terminology. Radar sets use the echo to determine the direction and distance
of the reflecting object.
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: The terms TARGET, RETURN, ECHO, CONTACT, OBJECT, and REFLECTING
OBJECT are used interchangeably throughout this module to indicate a surface or airborne object that has
been detected by a radar system.
</p><p class="paragraph">Radar systems also have some characteristics in common with telescopes. Both provide only a
limited field of view and require reference coordinate systems to define the positions of detected objects.
If you describe the location of an object as you see it through a telescope, you will most likely refer to
prominent features of the landscape. Radar requires a more precise reference system. Radar surface
angular measurements are normally made in a clockwise direction from TRUE NORTH, as shown in
figure 1-2, or from the heading line of a ship or aircraft. The surface of the earth is represented by an
imaginary flat plane, tangent (or parallel) to the earth’s surface at that location. This plane is referred to as
the HORIZONTAL PLANE. All angles in the up direction are measured in a second imaginary plane that
is perpendicular to the horizontal plane.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

ELEVATION ANGLE. The angle measured clockwise from true north in the horizontal plane is called
the TRUE BEARING or AZIMUTH angle. These three coordinates of range, bearing, and elevation
describe the location of an object with respect to the antenna.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RANGE-1-3-">RANGE
</h2><p class="paragraph">Radar measurement of range, or distance, is made possible because of the properties of radiated
electromagnetic energy. This energy normally travels through space in a straight line, at a constant speed,
and will vary only slightly because of atmospheric and weather conditions. The effects atmosphere and
weather have on this energy will be discussed later in this chapter; however, for this discussion on
determining range, these effects will be temporarily ignored.
</p><p class="paragraph">Electromagnetic energy travels through air at approximately the speed of light, which is 186,000
STATUTE MILES per second. The Navy uses NAUTICAL MILES to calculate distances; 186,000
statute miles is approximately 162,000 nautical miles. While the distance of the statute mile is
approximately 5,280 feet, the distance for a nautical mile is approximately 6,080 feet.
</p><p class="paragraph">Radar timing is usually expressed in microseconds. To relate radar timing to distances traveled by
radar energy, you should know that radiated energy from a radar set travels at approximately 984 feet per
microsecond. With the knowledge that a nautical mile is approximately 6,080 feet, we can figure the
approximate time required for radar energy to travel one nautical mile using the following calculation:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

foot approximation of a nautical mile is converted to 2,027 yards and energy speed is changed from 984
feet to 328 yards per microsecond:
</p><p class="paragraph">A pulse-type radar set transmits a short burst of electromagnetic energy. Target range is determined
by measuring elapsed time while the pulse travels to and returns from the target. Because two-way travel
is involved, a total time of 12.36 (6.18 x 2) microseconds per nautical mile will elapse between the start of
the pulse from the antenna and its return to the antenna from a target. This 12.36 microsecond time
interval is sometimes referred to as a RADAR MILE, RADAR NAUTICAL MILE, or NAUTICAL
RADAR MILE. The range in nautical miles to an object can be found by measuring the elapsed time
during a round trip of a radar pulse and dividing this quantity by 12.36. In equation form, this is:
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, if the elapsed time for an echo is 62 microseconds, then the distance is 5 miles, as
shown in the following calculation:

</p><h3 class="subsection">Minimum Range
</h3><p class="paragraph">Recall from NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles, that the DUPLEXER alternately switches
the antenna between the transmitter and receiver so that only one antenna need be used. This switching is
necessary because the high-power pulses of the transmitter would destroy the receiver if energy were
allowed to enter the receiver. As you probably already realize, timing of this switching action is critical to
the operation of the radar system. What you may not realize is that the minimum range ability of the radar
system is also affected by this timing. The two most important times in this action are PULSE WIDTH
and RECOVERY TIME.
</p><p class="paragraph">This timing action must be such that during the transmitted pulse (pulse width), only the transmitter
can be connected to the antenna. Immediately after the pulse is transmitted, the antenna must be
reconnected to the receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">The leading edge of the transmitted pulse causes the duplexer to align the antenna to the transmitter.
This action is essentially instantaneous. At the end of the transmitted pulse, the trailing edge of the pulse
causes the duplexer to line up the antenna with the receiver; however, this action is not instantaneous. A
small amount of time elapses at this point that is referred to as recovery time. Therefore, the total time in
which the receiver is unable to receive the reflected pulse is equal to the pulse width plus the recovery
time. Note that any reflected pulses from close targets returning before the receiver is connected to the
antenna will be undetected. The minimum range, in yards, at which a target can be detected is determined
using the following formula (pulse width and recovery time are expressed in microseconds or fractions of
microseconds):
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, minimum range for a radar system with a pulse width of 25 microseconds and a
recovery time of 0.1 microseconds is figured as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">Most modern radar systems are designed with such small recovery times that this figure can often be
ignored when figuring minimum range.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Maximum Range
</h3><p class="paragraph">The maximum range of a pulse radar system depends upon CARRIER FREQUENCY, PEAK
POWER of the transmitted pulse, PULSE-REPETITION FREQUENCY (prf) or PULSE REPETITION
RATE (prr), and RECEIVER SENSITIVITY with prf as the primary limiting factor. The peak power of
the pulse determines what maximum range the pulse can travel to a target and still return a usable echo. A
usable echo is the smallest signal detectable by a receiver system that can be processed and presented on
an indicator.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-6
</p><p class="paragraph">The frequency of the rf energy in the pulse radiated by a radar is referred to as the CARRIER
FREQUENCY of the radar system. The carrier frequency is often a limiting factor in the maximum range
capability of a radar system because radio frequency energy above 3,000 megahertz is rapidly attenuated
by the atmosphere. This decreases the usable range of radio-frequency energy. Therefore, as the carrier
frequency is increased, the transmitted power must also be increased to cover the same range. Long-range
coverage is more easily achieved at lower frequencies because atmospheric conditions have less effect on
low-frequency energy.
</p><p class="paragraph">Radar systems radiate each pulse at the carrier frequency during transmit time, wait for returning
echoes during listening or rest time, and then radiate a second pulse, as shown in figure 1-3. The number
of pulses radiated in one second is called the pulse-repetition frequency (prf), or the pulse-repetition rate
(prr). The time between the beginning of one pulse and the start of the next pulse is called PULSE-
REPETITION TIME (prt) and is equal to the reciprocal of prf as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">AMBIGUOUS RETURNS.—The radar timing system must be reset to zero each time a pulse is
radiated. This is to ensure that the range detected is measured from time zero each time. The prt of the
radar becomes important in maximum range determination because target return times that exceed the prt
of the radar system appear at incorrect locations (ranges) on the radar screen. Returns that appear at these
incorrect ranges are referred to as AMBIGUOUS RETURNS or SECOND-SWEEP ECHOES.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-4 illustrates a radar system with a 1 millisecond prt. The pulses are shown at the top, and
examples of two transmitted pulses hitting targets and returning are shown at the bottom. In the case of
target A, the pulse travels round trip in 0.5 millisecond, which equates to a target range of 82,000 yards.
Since 0.5 millisecond is less than 1 millisecond, displaying a correct range is no problem. However, target
B is 196,800 yards distant from the radar system. In this case, total pulse travel time is 1.2 milliseconds
and exceeds the prt limitation of 1 millisecond for this radar. While the first transmitted pulse is traveling
to and returning from target B, a second pulse is transmitted and the radar system is reset to 0 again. The
first pulse from target B continues its journey back to the radar system, but arrives during the timing
period for the second pulse. This results in an inaccurate reading. In this case, the first return pulse from
target B arrives 0.2 millisecond into the second timing period. This results in a range of 32,800 yards
instead of the actual 196,800 yards. You should see from this example that pulse returns in excess of the
prt of the radar system result in ambiguous ranges while pulse returns within the prt limits result in</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

PULSE-REPETITION FREQUENCY AND POWER CALCULATIONS.—The energy content
</p><p class="paragraph">of a continuous-wave radar transmission may be easily figured because the transmitter operates
continuously. However, pulsed radar transmitters are switched on and off to provide range timing
information with each pulse. The resulting waveform for a transmitter was shown in figure 1-3. The
amount of energy in this waveform is important because maximum range is directly related to transmitter
output power. The more energy the radar system transmits, the greater the target detection range will be.
The energy content of the pulse is equal to the PEAK (maximum) POWER LEVEL of the pulse
multiplied by the pulse width. However, meters used to measure power in a radar system do so over a
period of time that is longer than the pulse width. For this reason, pulse-repetition time is included in the
power calculations for transmitters. Power measured over such a period of time is referred to as
AVERAGE POWER. Figure 1-5 illustrates the way this average power would be shown as the total
energy content of the pulse. The shaded area represents the total energy content of the pulse; the
crosshatched area represents average power and is equal to peak power spread out over the prt. (Keep in
mind, as you look at figure 1-5, that no energy is actually present between pulses in a pulsed radar</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

used to help figure average power because it defines the total time from the beginning of one pulse to the

</p><p class="paragraph">The product of pulse width (pw) and pulse-repetition frequency (prf) in the above formula is called
the DUTY CYCLE of a radar system. The duty cycle is a ratio of the time on to the time off of the

power of a radar system. The formula for duty cycle is shown below:

</p><p class="paragraph">ANTENNA HEIGHT AND SPEED.—Another factor affecting radar range is antenna height. The
high-frequency energy transmitted by a radar system travels in a straight line and does not normally bend
to conform to the curvature of the earth. Because of this, the height of both the antenna and the target are
factors in detection range. The distance to the horizon (in nautical miles) for a radar system varies with
the height of the antenna according to the following formula:
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, assume antenna height to be 64 feet in the following calculations:
</p><p class="paragraph">A target at a range greater than the radar horizon will not be detected unless it is high enough to be
above the horizon. An example of the antenna- and target-height relationship is shown in figure 1-7.
</p><p class="paragraph">The antenna-rotation rate also affects maximum detection range. The slower an antenna rotates, the
greater the detection range of a radar system. When the antenna is rotated at 10 revolutions per minute
(rpm), the beam of energy strikes each target for just one-half the time it would if the rotation were 5 rpm.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

enough pulses must be transmitted to return a usable echo.
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: The more pulses transmitted to a given area (at slower antenna speeds), the greater the
number of hits per scan.
</p><p class="paragraph">As an example, if the antenna rotates at 20 rpm, it completes a revolution in 3 seconds. During this
time, a transmitter with a prf of 200 pulses per second (pps) transmits 600 pulses. Since 360 degrees of
azimuth must be covered, the following formula shows the number of pulses for each degree of azimuth:

</p><p class="paragraph">The antennas of most radar systems are designed to radiate energy in a one-directional lobe or beam that
can be moved in bearing simply by moving the antenna. As you can see in figure 1-9, the shape of the
beam is such that the echo signal strength varies in amplitude as the antenna beam moves across the
target. At antenna position A, the echo is minimal; at position B, where the beam axis is pointing directly
at the target, the echo strength is maximum. Thus, the bearing angle of the target can be obtained by
moving the antenna to the position at which the echo is strongest. In actual practice, search radar antennas
move continuously; the point of maximum echo return is determined by the detection circuitry as the
beam passes the target or visually by the operator. Weapons-control and guidance radar systems are
positioned to the point of maximum signal return and maintained at that position either manually or by
automatic tracking circuits.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ALTITUDE-1-12-">ALTITUDE
</h2><p class="paragraph">Many radar systems are designed to determine only the range and bearing of an object. Such radar
systems are called TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) radars. In most cases these systems are further described
as SEARCH RADAR SYSTEMS and function as early-warning devices that search a fixed volume of
space. The range and bearing coordinates provide enough information to place the target in a general area
with respect to the radar site and to determine distance, direction of travel, and relative speed. However,
when action must be taken against an airborne target, altitude must be known as well. A search radar
system that detects altitude as well as range and bearing is called a THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) radar.
</p><p class="paragraph">Altitude- or height-finding search radars use a beam that is very narrow in the vertical plane. The
beam is scanned in elevation, either mechanically or electronically, to pinpoint targets. Height-finding
radar systems that also determine bearing must have a beam that is very narrow in both the vertical and
horizontal planes. An electronic elevation-scanning pattern for a search radar set is illustrated in figure 1-10.
Lines originating at the antenna indicate the number of beam positions required for complete elevation
coverage. In practice the beams overlap slightly to prevent any gaps in the coverage. Each beam position
corresponds to a slight change in either the frequency or phase of the radiated energy. A change in either

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TARGET-RESOLUTION-1-13-">TARGET RESOLUTION
</h2><p class="paragraph">The TARGET RESOLUTION of a radar is its ability to distinguish between targets that are very
close together in either range or bearing. Weapons-control radar, which requires great precision, should
be able to distinguish between targets that are only yards apart. Search radar is usually less precise and
only distinguishes between targets that are hundreds of yards or even miles apart. Resolution is usually
divided into two categories; RANGE RESOLUTION and BEARING RESOLUTION.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Range Resolution
</h3><p class="paragraph">Range resolution is the ability of a radar system to distinguish between two or more targets on the
same bearing but at different ranges. The degree of range resolution depends on the width of the
transmitted pulse, the types and sizes of targets, and the efficiency of the receiver and indicator. Pulse
width is the primary factor in range resolution. A well-designed radar system, with all other factors at
maximum efficiency, should be able to distinguish targets separated by one-half the pulse width time.
Therefore, the theoretical range resolution of a radar system can be calculated from the following
formula:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The above formula is often written as:
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, if a radar system has a pulse width of 5 microseconds, the range resolution is calculated
as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">In the above example, targets on the same bearing would have to be separated by more than 820
yards to show up as two targets on your indicator.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Bearing Resolution
</h3><p class="paragraph">Bearing, or azimuth, resolution is the ability of a radar system to separate objects at the same range
but at different bearings. The degree of bearing resolution depends on radar beam width and the range of
the targets. Range is a factor in bearing resolution because the radar beam spreads out as range increases.
A RADAR BEAM is defined in width in terms of HALF-POWER POINTS. All the points off the
centerline of the beam that are at one-half the power level at the center are plotted to define beam width.
When the half-power points are connected to the antenna by a curve, such as that shown in figure 1-11,
the resulting angular width of the curve is called the ANTENNA BEAM WIDTH. The physical size and
shape of the antenna determines beam width. Beam width can vary from about 1 degree up to 60 degrees.
In figure 1-11, only the target within the half-power points will reflect a useful echo. Two targets at the
same range must be separated by at least one beam width to be distinguished as two objects.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADAR-ACCURACY-1-15-">RADAR ACCURACY
</h2><p class="paragraph">Radar accuracy is a measure of the ability of a radar system to determine the correct range, bearing,
and, in some cases, height of an object. The degree of accuracy is primarily determined by the resolution
of the radar system. Some additional factors affecting accuracy are pulse shape and atmospheric
conditions.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Pulse Shape
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the case of a pulse radar, the shape and width of the rf pulse influences minimum range, range
accuracy, and maximum range. The ideal pulse shape is a square wave having vertical leading and trailing
edges. However, equipments do not usually produce the ideal waveforms.
</p><p class="paragraph">The factors influencing minimum range are discussed first. Since the receiver cannot receive target
reflections while the transmitter is operating, you should be able to see that a narrow pulse is necessary
for short ranges. A sloping trailing edge extends the width of the transmitter pulse, although it may add
very little to the total power generated. Therefore, along with a narrow pulse, the trailing edge should be
as near vertical as possible.
</p><p class="paragraph">A sloping leading edge also affects minimum range as well as range accuracy since it provides no
definite point from which to measure elapsed time on the indicator time base. Using a starting point at the
lower edge of the pulse’s leading edge would increase minimum range. Using a starting point high up on
the slope would reduce the accuracy of range measurements at short ranges which are so vital for accurate
solution of the fire-control problem.
</p><p class="paragraph">Maximum range is influenced by pulse width and pulse repetition frequency (prf). Since a target can
reflect only a very small part of the transmitted power, the greater the transmitted power, the greater the
strength of the echo that could be received. Thus, a transmitted pulse should quickly rise to its maximum
amplitude, remain at this amplitude for the duration of the desired pulse width, and decay instantaneously
to zero. Figure 1-12 illustrates the effects of pulse shapes.

direct or reflected, usually is slightly curved; and the speed is affected by temperature, atmospheric
pressure, and the amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere, which all affect the refractive index.
As altitude increases, the combined effects of these influences, under normal atmospheric conditions,
cause a small, uniform increase in signal speed. This increase in speed causes the travel path to curve
slightly downward, as shown in figure 1-13. The downward curve extends the radar horizon beyond a line
tangent to the earth, as illustrated in figure 1-14.
</p><p class="paragraph">The reason for the downward curve can be illustrated using line AB in figure 1-13. Line AB
represents the surface of a wavefront with point A higher in altitude than point B. As wavefront AB
moves to the point represented by A’B’, the speed at A and A’ is faster than the speed at B and  B’ since A
and  A’ are at a greater altitude. Therefore, in a given time, the upper part of the wavefront moves farther
than the lower part. The wavefront leans slightly forward as it moves. Since the direction of energy
propagation is always perpendicular to the surface of a wavefront, the tilted wavefront causes the energy
path to curve downward.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">REFRACTION is the bending of electromagnetic waves caused by a change in the density of the
medium through which the waves are passing. A visible example of electromagnetic refraction is the
apparent displacement of underwater objects caused by the bending of light as it passes from the
atmosphere into the water. An INDEX OF REFRACTION has been established which indicates the
degree of refraction, or bending, caused by different substances. Because the density of the atmosphere
changes with altitude, the index of refraction changes gradually with height.
</p><p class="paragraph">The temperature and moisture content of the atmosphere normally decrease uniformly with an
increase in altitude. However, under certain conditions the temperature may first increase with height and
then begin to decrease. Such a situation is called a temperature inversion. An even more important
deviation from normal may exist over the ocean. Since the atmosphere close to the surface over large
bodies of water may contain more than a normal amount of moisture, the moisture content may decrease
more rapidly at heights just above the sea. This effect is referred to as MOISTURE LAPSE.
</p><p class="paragraph">Either temperature inversion or moisture lapse, alone or in combination, can cause a large change in
the refraction index of the lowest few-hundred feet of the atmosphere. The result is a greater bending of
the radar waves passing through the abnormal condition. The increased bending in such a situation is
referred to as DUCTING and may greatly affect radar performance. The radar horizon may be extended
or reduced, depending on the direction the radar waves are bent. The effect of ducting on radar waves is
illustrated in figure 1-15.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another effect of the atmosphere on radar performance is caused by particles suspended in the air.
Water droplets and dust particles diffuse radar energy through absorption, reflection, and scattering so
less energy strikes the target. Consequently, the return echo is smaller. The overall effect is a reduction in
usable range that varies widely with weather conditions. The higher the frequency of a radar system, the
more it is affected by weather conditions such as rain or clouds. In some parts of the world, dust
suspended in the air can greatly decrease the normal range of high-frequency radar.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Radar systems, like other complex electronics systems, are composed of several major subsystems
and many individual circuits. This section will introduce you to the major subsystems common to most
radar sets. A brief functional description of subsystem principles of operation will be provided. A much
more detailed explanation of radar subsystems will be given in chapters 2 and 3. Since most radar systems
in use today are some variation of the pulse radar system, the units discussed in this section will be those
used in pulse radar. All other types of radar use some variation of these units, and these variations will be
explained as necessary.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADAR-COMPONENTS-1-18-">RADAR COMPONENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Pulse radar systems can be functionally divided into the six essential components shown in
figure 1-16. These components are briefly described in the following paragraphs and will be explained in
detail after that:
</p><p class="paragraph">• The SYNCHRONIZER (also referred to as the TIMER or KEYER) supplies the synchronizing
signals that time the transmitted pulses, the indicator, and other associated circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The TRANSMITTER generates electromagnetic energy in the form of short, powerful pulses.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The DUPLEXER allows the same antenna to be used for transmitting and receiving.

highly directional beam, receives any returning echoes, and routes those echoes to the receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The RECEIVER amplifies the weak, electromagnetic pulses returned from the reflecting object
and reproduces them as video pulses that are sent to the indicator.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">• The INDICATOR produces a visual indication of the echo pulses in a manner that, at a minimum,
furnishes range and bearing information.
</p><p class="paragraph">While the physical configurations of radar systems differ, any radar system can be represented by the
functional block diagram in figure 1-16. An actual radar set may have several of these functional
components within one physical unit, or a single one of these functions may require several physical
units. However, the functional block diagram of a basic radar set may be used to analyze the operation of
almost any radar set.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the following paragraphs, a brief description of the operation of each of the major components is
given.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Synchronizer (Timer)
The synchronizer ensures that all circuits connected with the radar system operate in a definite timed
</h3><p class="paragraph">relationship. It also times the interval between transmitted pulses to ensure that the interval is of the
proper length. Timing pulses are used to ensure synchronous circuit operation and are related to the prf.
The prf can be set by any stable oscillator, such as a sine-wave oscillator, multivibrator, or a blocking
oscillator. That output is then applied to pulse-shaping circuits to produce timing pulses. Associated
components can be timed by the output of the synchronizer or by a timing signal from the transmitter as it
is turned on.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Transmitter
</h3><p class="paragraph">The transmitter generates powerful pulses of electromagnetic energy at precise intervals. The
required power is obtained by using a high-power microwave oscillator, such as a magnetron, or a
microwave amplifier, such as a klystron, that is supplied by a low-power rf source. (The construction and
operation of microwave components can be reviewed in NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles.) The
high-power generator, whether an oscillator or amplifier, requires operating power in the form of a
properly-timed, high-amplitude, rectangular pulse. This pulse is supplied by a transmitter unit called the
MODULATOR. When a high-power oscillator is used, the modulator high-voltage pulse switches the
oscillator on and off to supply high-power electromagnetic energy. When a microwave power amplifier is
used, the modulator pulse activates the amplifier just before the arrival of an electromagnetic pulse from a
preceding stage or a frequency-generation source. Normally, because of the extremely high voltage
involved, the modulator pulse is supplied to the cathode of the power tube and the plate is at ground
potential to shield personnel from shock hazards. The modulator pulse may be more than 100,000 volts in
high-power radar transmitters. In any case, radar transmitters produce voltages, currents, and radiation
hazards that are extremely dangerous to personnel. Safety precautions must always be strictly observed
when working in or around a radar transmitter.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Duplexer
</h3><p class="paragraph">A duplexer is essentially an electronic switch that permits a radar system to use a single antenna to
both transmit and receive. The duplexer must connect the antenna to the transmitter and disconnect the
antenna from the receiver for the duration of the transmitted pulse. The receiver must be completely
isolated from the transmitted pulse to avoid damage to the extremely sensitive receiver input circuitry.
After the transmitter pulse has ended, the duplexer must rapidly disconnect the transmitter and connect
the receiver to the antenna. As previously mentioned, the switching time is called receiver recovery time,
and must be very fast if close-in targets are to be detected. Additionally, the duplexer should absorb very
little power during either phase of operation. Low-loss characteristics are particularly important during
the receive period of duplexer operation. This is because the received signals are of extremely low
amplitude.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Antenna System
</h3><p class="paragraph">The antenna system routes the pulse from the transmitter, radiates it in a directional beam, picks up
the returning echo, and passes it to the receiver with a minimum of loss. The antenna system includes the
antenna, transmission lines and waveguide from the transmitter to the antenna, and the transmission line
and waveguide from the antenna to the receiver. In some publications the duplexer is included as a
component of the antenna system.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Receiver
</h3><p class="paragraph">The receiver accepts the weak echo signals from the antenna system, amplifies them, detects the
pulse envelope, amplifies the pulses, and then routes them to the indicator. One of the primary functions
of the radar receiver is to convert the frequency of the received echo signal to a lower frequency that is
easier to amplify. This is because radar frequencies are very high and difficult to amplify. This lower
frequency is called the INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCY (IF). The type of receiver that uses this
frequency conversion technique is the SUPER HETERODYNE RECEIVER. Superheterodyne receivers
used in radar systems must have good stability and extreme sensitivity. Stability is ensured by careful
design and the overall sensitivity is greatly increased by the use of many IF stages.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Indicator
</h3><p class="paragraph">The indicator uses the received signals routed from the radar receiver to produce a visual indication
of target information. The cathode-ray oscilloscope is an ideal instrument for the presentation of radar
data. This is because it not only shows a variation of a single quantity, such as voltage, but also gives an
indication of the relative values of two or more quantities. The sweep frequency of the radar indicator is
determined by the pulse-repetition frequency of the radar system. Sweep duration is determined by the
setting of the range-selector switch. Since the indicator is so similar to an oscilloscope, the term RADAR
SCOPE is commonly used when referring to radar indicators.
</p><p class="question"> Q17. What radar subsystem supplies timing signals to coordinate the operation of the complete
system?
</p><p class="question"> Q18. When a transmitter uses a high-power oscillator to produce the output pulse, what switches the
oscillator on and off?
</p><p class="question"> Q19. What radar component permits the use of a single antenna for both transmitting and receiving?
SCANNING
</p><p class="paragraph">Radar systems are often identified by the type of SCANNING the system uses. Scanning is the
systematic movement of a radar beam in a definite pattern while searching for or tracking a target. The
type and method of scanning used depends on the purpose and type of radar and on the antenna size and
design. In some cases, the type of scan will change with the particular system mode of operation. For
example, in a particular radar system, the search mode scan may be quite different from that of the track
mode scan.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Stationary-Lobe Scanning
</h3><p class="paragraph">A SINGLE STATIONARY-LOBE SCANNING SYSTEM is the simplest type of scanning. This
method produces a single beam that is stationary in relation to the antenna. The antenna is then
mechanically rotated continuously to obtain complete 360-degree azimuth coverage. A stationary lobe,
however, cannot satisfactorily track a moving object because it does not provide enough information
about the object’s movement to operate automatic tracking circuits, such as those in fire-control tracking</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-21
</p><p class="paragraph">radar. A two-dimensional search radar, however, does use a single-lobe that is scanned in a 360-degree
pattern because automatic tracking circuits are not normally used in 2D radars.
</p><p class="paragraph">Single-lobe scanning is unsuitable for use as a tracking radar for several reasons. For example, let’s
assume that a target is somewhere on the lobe axis and the receiver is detecting signals reflected from the
target. If these reflected signals begin to decrease in strength, the target likely has flown off the lobe axis.
In this case, the beam must be moved to continue tracking. The beam might be moved by an operator
tracking the target with an optical sight, but such tracking is slow, inaccurate, and limited by conditions of
visibility. An automatic tracking system would require that the beam SCAN, or search, the target area in
such a case.
</p><p class="paragraph">Again, assume that a missile is riding (following) the axis of a single beam. The strength of the
signals it receives (by means of a radar receiver in the missile) will gradually decrease as its distance from
the transmitter increases. If the signal strength decreases suddenly, the missile will know, from built-in
detection circuitry, that it is no longer on the axis of the lobe. But it will not know which way to turn to
get back on the axis. A simple beam does not contain enough information for missile guidance.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Methods of Beam Scanning
</h3><p class="paragraph">The two basic methods of beam scanning are MECHANICAL and ELECTRONIC. In mechanical
scanning, the beam can be moved in various ways: (1) The entire antenna can be moved in the desired
pattern; (2) the energy feed source can be moved relative to a fixed reflector; or (3) the reflector can be
moved relative to a fixed source. In electronic scanning, the beam is effectively moved by such means as
(1) switching between a set of feeder sources, (2) varying the phasing between elements in a multielement
array, or (3) comparing the amplitude and phase differences between signals received by a multielement
array. A combination of mechanical and electronic scanning is also used in some antenna systems.
</p><p class="paragraph">MECHANICAL SCANNING.—The most common type of mechanical scanning is the rotation of
the antenna through 360 degrees to obtain azimuth coverage. Most search radar sets use this method. A
common form of scanning for target tracking or missile beam-rider systems is CONICAL (cone-like)
SCANNING. This is generally accomplished mechanically by NUTATING the rf feed point.
</p><p class="paragraph">Nutation is difficult to describe in words but easy to demonstrate. Hold a pencil in two hands. While
holding the eraser end as still as possible, swing the point in a circular motion. This motion of the pencil
is referred to as nutation; the pencil point corresponds to the open, or transmitting, end of the waveguide
antenna. The important fact to remember is that polarization of the beam is not changed during the
scanning cycle. This means that the axis of the moving feeder does not change either horizontal or vertical
orientation while the feeder is moving. You might compare the feeder movement to that of a ferris wheel;
that is, the vertical orientation of each seat remains the same regardless of the position of the wheel.
</p><p class="paragraph">Recall that a waveguide is a metal pipe, usually rectangular in cross section, used to conduct the rf
energy from the transmitter to the antenna. The open end of the waveguide faces the concave side of the
reflector and the rf energy it emits is bounced from the reflector surface.
</p><p class="paragraph">A conical scan can be generated by nutation of the waveguide. In this process the axis of the
waveguide itself is moved through a small conical pattern. In an actual installation of a nutating
waveguide, the three-dimensional movement is fast and of small amplitude. To an observer, the
waveguide appears merely to be vibrating slightly.
</p><p class="paragraph">By movement of either the waveguide or the antenna, you can generate a conical scan pattern, as
shown in figure 1-17. The axis of the radar lobe is made to sweep out a cone in space; the apex of this
cone is, of course, at the radar transmitter antenna or reflector. At any given distance from the antenna,</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">the path of the lobe axis is a circle. Within the useful range of the beam, the inner edge of the lobe always
overlaps the axis of scan.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now assume that we use a conically scanned beam for target tracking. If the target is on the scan
axis, the strength of the reflected signals remains constant (or changes gradually as the range changes).
But if the target is slightly off the axis, the amplitude of the reflected signals will change at the scan rate.
For example, if the target is to the left of the scan axis, as shown in figure 1-18, the reflected signals will
be of maximum strength as the lobe sweeps through the left part of its cone; the signals will quickly
decrease to a minimum as the lobe sweeps through the right part. Information on the instantaneous
position of the beam, relative to the scan axis, and on the strength of the reflected signals is fed to a
computer. Such a computer in the radar system is referred to as the angle-tracking or angle-servo circuit
(also angle-error detector). If the target moves off the scan axis, the computer instantly determines the
direction and amount of antenna movement required to continue tracking. The computer output is used to
control servomechanisms that move the antenna. In this way, the target is tracked accurately and
automatically.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

phase. These four signals are radiated at the same time from each of four feedhorns that are grouped in a
cluster. The resulting radiated energy is focused into a beam by a microwave lens. Energy reflected from
targets is refocused by the lens back into the feedhorns. The total amount of the energy received by each
horn varies, depending on the position of the target relative to the beam axis. This is illustrated in figure
1-19 for four targets at different positions with respect to the beam axis. Note that a phase inversion takes
place at the microwave lens similar to the image inversion that takes place in an optical system.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The amplitude of returned signals received by each horn is continuously compared with those
received in the other horns. Error signals are generated which indicate the relative position of the target
with respect to the axis of the beam. Angle servo circuits receive these error signals and correct the
position of the radar beam to keep the beam axis on target.
</p><p class="paragraph">The TRAVERSE (BEARING) SIGNAL is made up of signals from horn A added to C and from
horn B added to D. By waveguide design, the sum of B and D is made 180 degrees out of phase with the
sum of A and C. These two are combined and the traverse signal is the difference of (A + C) -  (B + D).
Since the horns are positioned as shown in figure 1-19, the relative amplitudes of the horn signals give an
indication of the magnitude of the traverse error. The elevation signal consists of the signals from horns
C and D added 180 degrees out of phase with horns A and B  [(A + B) -  (C + D)]. The sum, or range,
signal is composed of signals from all four feedhorns added together in phase. It provides a reference
from which target direction from the center of the beam axis is measured. The range signal is also used as
a phase reference for the traverse and elevation-error signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">The traverse and elevation error signals are compared in the radar receiver with the range or
reference signal. The output of the receiver may be either positive or negative pulses; the amplitudes of
the pulses are proportional to the angle between the beam axis and a line drawn to the target. The
polarities of the output pulses indicate whether the target is above or below, to the right or to the left of
the beam axis. Of course, if the target is directly on the line of sight, the output of the receiver is zero and
no angle-tracking error is produced.
</p><p class="paragraph">An important advantage of a monopulse-tracking radar over radar using conical scan is that the
instantaneous angular measurements are not subject to errors caused by target SCINTILLATION.
Scintillation can occur as the target maneuvers or moves and the radar pulses bounce off different areas of
the target. This causes random reflectivity and may lead to tracking errors. Monopulse tracking radar is
not subject to this type of error because each pulse provides an angular measurement without regard to the</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

advantage of monopulse tracking is that no mechanical action is required.
</p><p class="paragraph">ELECTRONIC SCANNING used in search radar systems was explained in general terms earlier in
this chapter during the discussion of elevation coverage. This type of electronic scanning is often called
FREQUENCY SCANNING. An in-depth explanation of frequency scanning theory can be found in the
fire control technician rate training manuals.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADAR-TRANSMISSION-METHODS-1-25-">RADAR TRANSMISSION METHODS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Radar systems are normally divided into operational categories based on energy transmission
methods. Up to this point, we have mentioned only the pulse method of transmission to illustrate basic
radar concepts. Although the pulse method is the most common method of transmitting radar energy, two
other methods are sometimes used in special applications. These are the continuous-wave (cw) method
and the frequency modulation (fm) method. All three basic transmission methods are often further
subdivided to designate specific variations or combinations.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CONTINUOUS-WAVE-METHOD-1-25-">CONTINUOUS-WAVE METHOD
</h2><p class="paragraph">When radio-frequency energy transmitted from a fixed point continuously strikes an object that is
either moving toward or away from the source of the energy, the frequency of the reflected energy is
changed. This shift in frequency is known as the DOPPLER EFFECT. The difference in frequency
between the transmitted and reflected energy indicates both the presence and the speed of a moving
target.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Doppler Effect
</h3><p class="paragraph">A common example of the Doppler effect in action is the changing pitch of the whistle of an
approaching train. The whistle appears to change pitch from a high tone, as the train approaches, to a
lower tone as it moves away from the observer. As the train approaches, an apparent increase in
frequency (an increase in pitch) is heard; as the train moves away, an apparent decrease in frequency (a
decrease in pitch) is heard. This pitch variation is known as the Doppler effect.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s examine the reason for this apparent change in pitch. Assume that the transmitter emits an
audio signal at a frequency of 60 hertz and that the transmitter is traveling at a velocity of 360 feet per
second (fps). At the end of 1 second, the transmitter will have moved from point P to point P1 as shown
in view A of figure 1-20. The total distance from point P to the observer is 1,080 feet. The velocity of
sound is 1,080 feet per second; thus, a sound emitted at point P will reach the observer in 1 second. To
find the wavelength of this transmitted signal, you divide the velocity of the signal (1,080 fps) by the
frequency (60 hertz). The result is 18 feet, as shown below:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In 1 second the transmitter moves 360 feet and transmits 60 hertz. At the end of 1 second, the first
cycle of the transmitted signal reaches the observer, just as the sixtieth cycle is leaving the transmitter at
point P1. Under these conditions the 60 hertz emitted is located between the observer and point P1.
Notice that this distance is only 720 feet (1,080 minus 360). The 60 hertz is spread over the distance from
point P1 to the observer and has a wavelength of just 12 feet (720 divided by 60). To find the new
frequency, use the following formula:
</p><p class="paragraph">The original frequency, 60 hertz, has changed to an apparent frequency of 90 hertz. This new
frequency only applies to the observer. Notice that the Doppler frequency variation is directly
proportional to the velocity of the approaching transmitter. The faster the transmitter moves toward the
observer, the greater the number of waves that will be crowded into the space between the transmitter and
the observer.
</p><p class="paragraph">Suppose the transmitter were stationary and the observer moving. When approaching the transmitter,
the observer would encounter waves per unit of time. As a result, the observer would hear a higher pitch
than the transmitter would actually emit.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the transmitter were traveling away from the observer, as shown in view B of figure 1-20, the first
cycle would leave the transmitter at point P and the sixtieth at point P2. The first cycle would reach the
observer when the transmitter reached P2. You would then have 60 cycles stretched out over 1,080 plus
360 feet, a total of 1,440 feet. The wavelength of these 60 hertz is 1,440/60, or 24 feet. The apparent
frequency is 1,080 divided by 24, or 45 hertz.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Uses of CW Doppler System
</h3><p class="paragraph">The continuous-wave, or Doppler, system is used in several ways. In one radar application, the radar
set differentiates between the transmitted and reflected wave to determine the speed of the moving object.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The Doppler method is the best means of detecting fast-moving objects that do not require range
resolution. As a moving object approaches the transmitter, it encounters and reflects more waves per unit
of time. The amount of frequency shift produced is very small in relation to the carrier frequency. This is
because the velocity of propagation of the signal is very high compared to the speed of the target.
However, because the carrier frequencies used in radar are high, larger frequency shifts (in the audio-
frequency range) are produced. The amount of shift is proportional to the speed of the reflecting object.
One-quarter cycle shift at 10,000 megahertz will provide speed measurements accurate to a fraction of a
percent.
</p><p class="paragraph">If an object is moving, its velocity, relative to the radar, can be detected by comparing the transmitter
frequency with the echo frequency (which differs because of the Doppler shift). The DIFFERENCE or
BEAT FREQUENCY, sometimes called the DOPPLER FREQUENCY (fd), is related to object velocity.
</p><p class="paragraph">The separation of the background and the radar contact is based on the Doppler frequency that is
caused by the reflection of the signal from a moving object. Disadvantages of the Doppler system are that
it does not determine the range of the object, nor is it able to differentiate between objects when they lie
in the same direction and are traveling at the same speed. Moreover, it does not "see" stationary or slow-
moving objects, which a pulse radar system can detect.
</p><p class="paragraph">To track an object with cw Doppler, you must determine the radar range. Since the Doppler
frequency is not directly related to range, another method is needed to determine object range. By using
two separate transmitters that operate at two different frequencies (f1 and f 2), you can determine range by
measuring the relative phase difference between the two Doppler frequencies. In such a system, a mixer is
used to combine the two transmitted frequencies and to separate the two received frequencies. This
permits the use of one transmitting and receiving antenna.
</p><p class="paragraph">Instead of using two transmitter frequencies, you can find the range by sweeping the transmitter
frequency uniformly in time to cover the frequency range from f1 to f2. The beat, or difference, frequency
between the transmitted and received signals is then a function of range. In this type of radar, the velocity
as well as range is measured.
</p><p class="question"> Q24. The Doppler effect causes a change in what aspect of rf energy that strikes a moving object?
 Q25. The Doppler variation is directly proportional to what radar contact characteristic?
 Q26. The Doppler method of object detection is best for what type objects?
 Q27. The beat frequency in a swept-frequency transmitter provides what contact information?
</p><p class="paragraph">FREQUENCY-MODULATION METHOD
In the frequency-modulation method, the transmitter radiates radio-frequency waves. The frequency
</p><p class="paragraph">of these rf waves is continually increasing and decreasing from a fixed reference frequency. At any
instant, the frequency of the returned signal differs from the frequency of the radiated signal. The amount
of the difference frequency is determined by the time it took the signal to travel the distance from the
transmitter to the object.
</p><p class="paragraph">An example of a frequency-modulated signal, plotted against time, is shown in figure 1-21. As
shown, the 420-megahertz frequency increases linearly to 460 megahertz and then quickly drops to 420
megahertz again. When the frequency drops to 420 megahertz the frequency cycle starts over again.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The frequency regularly changes 40 megahertz with respect to time; therefore, its value at any time
during its cycle can be used as the basis for computing the time elapsed after the start of the frequency
cycle. For example, at T0 the transmitter sends a 420-megahertz signal toward an object. It strikes the
object and returns to the receiver at T1, when the transmitter is sending out a new frequency of 440
megahertz. At T1, the 420-megahertz returned signal and the 440-megahertz transmitter signal are fed to
the receiver simultaneously. When the two signals are mixed in the receiver, a beat frequency results. The
beat frequency varies directly with the distance to the object, increasing as the distance increases. Using
this information, you can calibrate a device that measures frequency to indicate range.
</p><p class="paragraph">This system works well when the detected object is stationary. It is used in aircraft altimeters which
give a continuous reading of the height above the earth of the aircraft. The system is not satisfactory for
locating moving objects. This is because moving targets produce a frequency shift in the returned signal
because of the Doppler effect; this affects the accuracy of the range measurement.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PULSE-MODULATION-METHOD-1-28-">PULSE-MODULATION METHOD
</h2><p class="paragraph">The pulse-modulation method of energy transmission was analyzed to some extent earlier in this
chapter. As the previous discussions indicated, radio-frequency energy can also be transmitted in very
short bursts, called pulses. These pulses are of extremely short time duration, usually on the order of 0.1
microsecond to approximately 50 microseconds. In this method, the transmitter is turned on for a very
short time and the pulse of radio-frequency energy is transmitted, as shown in view A of figure 1-22. The
transmitter is then turned off, and the pulse travels outward from the transmitter at the velocity of light
(view B). When the pulse strikes an object (view C), it is reflected and begins to travel back toward the
radar system, still moving at the same velocity (view D). The pulse is then received by the radar system
(view E). The time interval between transmission and reception is computed and converted into a visual
indication of range in miles or yards. The radar cycle then starts over again by transmitting another pulse
(view F). This method does not depend on the relative frequency of the returned signal or on the motion
of the target; therefore, it has an important advantage over cw and fm methods.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

A requirement for any Doppler radar is COHERENCE; that is, some definite phase relationship must
</p><p class="paragraph">exist between the transmitted frequency and the reference frequency, which is used to detect the Doppler
shift of the receiver signal. Moving objects are detected by the phase difference between the target signal
and background noise components. Phase detection of this type relies on coherence between the
transmitter frequency and the receiver reference frequency.
</p><p class="paragraph">In coherent detection, a stable cw reference oscillator signal, which is locked in phase with the
transmitter during each transmitted pulse, is mixed with the echo signal to produce a beat or difference
signal. Since the reference oscillator and the transmitter are locked in phase, the echoes are effectively
compared with the transmitter in frequency and phase.
</p><p class="paragraph">The phase relationships of the echoes from fixed objects to the transmitter is constant and the
amplitude of the beat signal remains constant. A beat signal of varying amplitude indicates a moving
object. This is because the phase difference between the reference oscillator signal and the echo signal
changes as the range to the reflecting object changes. The constant amplitude beat signal is filtered out in
the receiver. The beat signal of varying amplitude is sent to the radar indicator scope for display.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADAR-FUNCTIONS-1-32-">RADAR FUNCTIONS
</h2><p class="paragraph">No single radar system has yet been designed that can perform all of the many radar functions
required by the military. Some of the newer systems combine several functions that formerly required
individual radar systems, but no single system can fulfill all the requirements of modern warfare. As a
result, modern warships, aircraft, and shore stations usually have several radar systems, each performing a
different function.
</p><p class="paragraph">One radar system, called SEARCH RADAR, is designed to continuously scan a volume of space to
provide initial detection of all targets. Search radar is almost always used to detect and determine the
position of new targets for later use by TRACK RADAR. Track radar provides continuous range, bearing,
and elevation data on one or more targets. Most of the radar systems used by the military are in one of
these two categories, though the individual radar systems vary in design and capability.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some radar systems are designed for specific functions that do not precisely fit into either of the
above categories. The radar speed gun is an example of radar designed specifically to measure the speed
of a target. The military uses much more complex radar systems that are adapted to detect only fast-
moving targets such as aircraft. Since aircraft usually move much faster than weather or surface targets,
velocity-sensitive radar can eliminate unwanted clutter from the radar indicator. Radar systems that detect
and process only moving targets are called MOVING-TARGET INDICATORS (mti) and are usually
combined with conventional search radar.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another form of radar widely used in military and civilian aircraft is the RADAR ALTIMETER. Just
as some surface-based radars can determine the height of a target, airborne radar can determine the
distance from an aircraft to the ground. Many aircraft use radar to determine height above the ground.
Radar altimeters usually use frequency-modulated signals of the type discussed earlier in the chapter.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The preceding paragraphs indicated that radar systems are divided into types based on the designed
use. This section presents the general characteristics of several commonly used radar systems. Typical
characteristics are discussed rather than the specific characteristics of any particular radar system.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SEARCH-RADAR-1-33-">SEARCH RADAR
</h2><p class="paragraph">Search radar, as previously mentioned, continuously scans a volume of space and provides initial
detection of all targets within that space. Search radar systems are further divided into specific types,
according to the type of object they are designed to detect. For example, surface-search, air-search, and
height-finding radars are all types of search radar.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Surface-Search Radar
</h3><p class="paragraph">A surface-search radar system has two primary functions: (1) the detection and determination of
accurate ranges and bearings of surface objects and low-flying aircraft and (2) the maintenance of a 360-
degree search pattern for all objects within line-of-sight distance from the radar antenna.
</p><p class="paragraph">The maximum range ability of surface-search radar is primarily limited by the radar horizon;
therefore, higher frequencies are used to permit maximum reflection from small, reflecting areas, such as
ship masthead structures and the periscopes of submarines. Narrow pulse widths are used to permit a high
degree of range resolution at short ranges and to achieve greater range accuracy. High pulse-repetition
rates are used to permit a maximum definition of detected objects. Medium peak power can be used to
permit the detection of small objects at line-of-sight distances. Wide vertical-beam widths permit
compensation for the pitch and roll of own ship and detection of low flying aircraft. Narrow horizontal-
beam widths permit accurate bearing determination and good bearing resolution. For example, a common
shipboard surface-search radar has the following design specifications:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Transmitter frequency 5,450-5,825 MHz
</h3><p class="paragraph">• Pulse width .25 or 1.3 microseconds
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Pulse-repetition rate between 625 and 650 pulses per second
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Peak power between 190 and 285 kW
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Vertical beam width between 12 and 16 degrees
</h3><p class="paragraph">• Horizontal beam width 1.5 degrees
</p><p class="paragraph">Surface-search radar is used to detect the presence of surface craft and low flying aircraft and to
determine their presence. Shipboard surface-search radar provides this type of information as an input to
the weapons system to assist in the engagement of hostile targets by fire-control radar. Shipboard surface-
search radar is also used extensively as a navigational aid in coastal waters and in poor weather
conditions. A typical surface-search radar antenna is shown in figure 1-24.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Air-Search Radar
</h3><p class="paragraph">Air-search radar systems initially detect and determine the position, course, and speed of air targets
in a relatively large area. The maximum range of air-search radar can exceed 300 miles, and the bearing
coverage is a complete 360-degree circle. Air-search radar systems are usually divided into two
categories, based on the amount of position information supplied. As mentioned earlier in this chapter,
radar sets that provide only range and bearing information are referred to as two-dimensional, or 2D,
radars. Radar sets that supply range, bearing, and height are called three-dimensional, or 3D, radars. (3D
radar will be covered in the next section.) The coverage pattern of a typical 2D radar system is illustrated
in figure 1-25. A typical 2D air-search radar antenna is shown in figure 1-26.

</p><p class="paragraph">Relatively low transmitter frequencies are used in 2D search radars to permit long-range
transmissions with minimum attenuation. Wide pulse widths and high peak power are used to aid in
detecting small objects at great distances. Low pulse-repetition rates are selected to permit greater
maximum range. A wide vertical-beam width is used to ensure detection of objects from the surface to
relatively high altitudes and to compensate for pitch and roll of own ship. The output characteristics of
specific air-search radars are classified; therefore, they will not be discussed.
</p><p class="paragraph">Air-search radar systems are used as early-warning devices because they can detect approaching
enemy aircraft or missiles at great distances. In hostile situations, early detection of the enemy is vital to a
successful defense against attack. Antiaircraft defenses in the form of shipboard guns, missiles, or fighter
planes must be brought to a high degree of readiness in time to repel an attack. Range and bearing
information, provided by air-search radars, used to initially position a fire-control tracking radar on a
target. Another function of the air-search radar system is guiding combat air patrol (CAP) aircraft to a
position suitable to intercept an enemy aircraft. In the case of aircraft control, the guidance information is
obtained by the radar operator and passed to the aircraft by either voice radio or a computer link to the
aircraft.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Height-Finding Search Radar
</h3><p class="paragraph">The primary function of a height-finding radar (sometimes referred to as a three-coordinate or 3D
radar) is that of computing accurate ranges, bearings, and altitudes of aircraft targets detected by air-
search radars. Height-finding radar is also used by the ship’s air controllers to direct CAP aircraft during
interception of air targets. Modern 3D radar is often used as the primary air-search radar (figure 1-27).
This is because of its high accuracy and because the maximum ranges are only slightly less than those
available from 2D radar.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The range capability of 3D search radar is limited to some extent by an operating frequency that is
higher than that of 2D radar. This disadvantage is partially offset by higher output power and a beam
width that is narrower in both the vertical and horizontal planes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The 3D radar system transmits several narrow beams to obtain altitude coverage and, for this reason,
compensation for roll and pitch must be provided for shipboard installations to ensure accurate height
information.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Radar that provides continuous positional data on a target is called tracking radar. Most tracking
radar systems used by the military are also fire-control radar; the two names are often used
interchangeably.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fire-control tracking radar systems usually produce a very narrow, circular beam.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fire-control radar must be directed to the general location of the desired target because of the
narrow-beam pattern. This is called the DESIGNATION phase of equipment operation. Once in the
general vicinity of the target, the radar system switches to the ACQUISITION phase of operation. During
acquisition, the radar system searches a small volume of space in a prearranged pattern until the target is
located. When the target is located, the radar system enters the TRACK phase of operation. Using one of
several possible scanning techniques, the radar system automatically follows all target motions. The radar
system is said to be locked on to the target during the track phase. The three sequential phases of
operation are often referred to as MODES and are common to the target-processing sequence of most fire-
control radars.
</p><p class="paragraph">Typical fire-control radar characteristics include a very high prf, a very narrow pulse width, and a
very narrow beam width. These characteristics, while providing extreme accuracy, limit the range and
make initial target detection difficult. A typical fire-control radar antenna is shown in figure 1-28. In this
example the antenna used to produce a narrow beam is covered by a protective radome.

passive homing missiles home in on energy that is radiated by the target. Because target position must be
known at all times, a guidance radar is generally part of, or associated with, a fire-control tracking radar.
In some instances, three radar beams are required to provide complete guidance for a missile. The beam-
riding missile, for example, must be launched into the beam and then must ride the beam to the target.
Initially, a wide beam is radiated by a capture radar to gain (capture) control of the missile. After the
missile enters the capture beam, a narrow beam is radiated by a guidance radar to guide the missile to the
target. During both capture and guidance operations, a tracking radar continues to track the target. Figure
1-29 illustrates the relationships of the three different radar beams.

(GCA) RADAR
</h3><p class="paragraph">CARRIER-CONTROLLED APPROACH and GROUND-CONTROLLED APPROACH radar
systems are essentially shipboard and land-based versions of the same type of radar. Shipboard CCA
radar systems are usually much more sophisticated systems than GCA systems. This is because of the
movements of the ship and the more complicated landing problems. Both systems, however, guide
aircraft to safe landing under conditions approaching zero visibility. By means of radar, aircraft are
detected and observed during the final approach and landing sequence. Guidance information is supplied
to the pilot in the form of verbal radio instructions, or to the automatic pilot (autopilot) in the form of
pulsed control signals.

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY
</h1><p class="paragraph">The following paragraphs summarize the important points of this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">RADAR is an electronic system that uses reflected electromagnetic energy to detect the presence
and position of objects invisible to the eye.
</p><p class="paragraph">TARGET POSITION is defined in reference to true north, the horizontal plane, and the vertical
plane.
</p><p class="paragraph">TRUE BEARING is the angle between true north and the line of sight to the target, measured in a
clockwise direction in the horizontal plane.
</p><p class="paragraph">ELEVATION ANGLE is the angle between the horizontal plane and the line of sight, measured in
the vertical plane.
</p><p class="paragraph">RANGE is the distance from the radar site to the target measured along the line of sight. The
concepts are illustrated in the figure.
</p><p class="paragraph">RANGE to any target can be calculated by measuring the time required for a pulse to travel to a
target and return to the radar receiver and by dividing the elapsed time by 12.36 microseconds.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The MINIMUM RANGE of a radar system can be calculated from the formula:
</p><p class="paragraph">The MAXIMUM RANGE of a pulse radar system depends on the CARRIER FREQUENCY,
PEAK POWER, PULSE-REPETITION FREQUENCY, and RECEIVER SENSITIVITY.
</p><p class="paragraph">PULSE-REPETITION TIME is the time between the beginning of one pulse and the beginning of
the next pulse and is the reciprocal of prf.
</p><p class="paragraph">AMBIGUOUS RETURNS are echoes from targets that exceed the prt of the radar system and result
in false range readings. The maximum (unambiguous) range for a radar system can be determined by the
formula:
</p><p class="paragraph">The PEAK POWER of a radar system is the total energy contained in a pulse. Peak power is
obtained by multiplying the maximum power level of a pulse by the pulse width.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since most instruments are designed to measure AVERAGE POWER over a period of time, prt must
be included in transmitter power measurements. The formula for average power is:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The product of pw and prf is called the DUTY CYCLE of a radar system and is the ratio of
transmitter time on to time off.
</p><p class="paragraph">The formula for the peak power (using average power) of a radar system is:
</p><p class="paragraph">Antenna height and ROTATION SPEED affect radar range. Since high-frequency energy does not
normally bend to follow the curvature of the earth, most radar systems cannot detect targets below the
RADAR HORIZON. The distance to the horizon for a radar system can be determined by the formula:
</p><p class="paragraph">The slower an antenna rotates, the larger the HITS PER SCAN value. The likelihood that a target
will produce a usable echo is also increased.
</p><p class="paragraph">The bearing to a target may be referenced to true north or to your own ship. Bearing referenced to
true north is TRUE BEARING and bearing referenced to your ship is RELATIVE BEARING, as shown
in the illustration. The bearing angle is obtained by moving the antenna to the point of maximum signal
return.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Radar systems that detect only range and bearing are called TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) radars.
Radars that detect height as well as range and bearing are called THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D)
RADARS.
</p><p class="paragraph">The target RESOLUTION of a radar system is its ability to distinguish between targets that are very
close together.
</p><p class="paragraph">RANGE RESOLUTION is the ability to distinguish between two or more targets on the same
bearing and is primarily dependent on the pulse width of the radar system. The formula for range
resolution is:
</p><h3 class="subsection">resolution = pw ·  164 yards per microsecond
</h3><p class="paragraph">BEARING RESOLUTION is the ability of a radar to separate targets at the same range but
different bearings. The degree of bearing resolution is dependent on beam width and range. The accuracy
of radar is largely dependent on resolution.
</p><p class="paragraph">ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS affect the speed and direction of travel of electromagnetic
wavefronts traveling through the air. Under normal conditions, the wavefronts increase uniformly in
speed as altitude increases which causes the travel path to curve downward. The downward curve extends
the radar horizon as shown in the illustration. The density of the atmosphere, the presence of water vapor,
and temperature changes also directly affect the travel of electromagnetic wavefronts.
</p><p class="paragraph">The major components in a typical PULSE RADAR SYSTEM are shown in the illustration. The
SYNCHRONIZER supplies the timing signals to coordinate the operation of the entire system. The
TRANSMITTER generates electromagnetic energy in short, powerful pulses. The DUPLEXER allows
the same antenna to be used to both transmit and receive. The RECEIVER detects and amplifies the
return signals. The INDICATOR produces a visual indication of the range and bearing of the echo.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">SCANNING is the systematic movement of a radar beam while searching for or tracking a target.
</p><p class="paragraph">STATIONARY-LOBE SCANNING is the simplest type of scanning and is usually used in 2D
search radar. Monopulse scanning, used in fire-control radars, employs four signal quantities to accurately
track moving targets. The two basic methods of scanning are MECHANICAL and ELECTRONIC.
</p><p class="paragraph">Radar systems are often divided into operational categories based on energy transmission methods—
continuous wave (cw), frequency modulation (fm), and pulse modulation (pm).
</p><p class="paragraph">The CONTINUOUS WAVE (cw) method transmits a constant frequency and detects moving
targets by detecting the change in frequency caused by electromagnetic energy reflecting from a moving
target. This change in frequency is called the DOPPLER SHIFT or DOPPLER EFFECT.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the FREQUENCY MODULATION (fm) method, a signal that constantly changes in frequency
around a fixed reference is used to detect stationary objects.
</p><p class="paragraph">The PULSE-MODULATION (pm) METHOD uses short pulses of energy and relatively long
listening times to accurately determine target range. Since this method does not depend on signal
frequency or target motion, it has an advantage over cw and fm methods. It is the most common type of
radar.
</p><p class="paragraph">Radar systems are also classified by function. SEARCH RADAR continuously scans a volume of
space and provides initial detection of all targets. TRACK RADAR provides continuous range, bearing,
and elevation data on one or more specific targets. Most radar systems are variations of these two types.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Although all of these circuits can be broadly classified as timing circuits, the specific function of any
individual circuit could also be wave shaping or wave generation. The operation of many of these circuits
and associated terms were described in detail in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and
Wave-Shaping Circuits.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SYNCHRONIZER-OPERATION-2-2-">SYNCHRONIZER OPERATION
</h2><p class="paragraph">Radar systems may be classified as either SELF-SYNCHRONIZED or EXTERNALLY
SYNCHRONIZED systems. In a self-synchronized system, the timing trigger pulses are generated in the
transmitter. In an externally synchronized system, the timing trigger pulses are generated by a MASTER
OSCILLATOR, which is usually external to the transmitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">The master oscillator in an externally synchronized system may be a BLOCKING OSCILLATOR, a
SINE-WAVE OSCILLATOR, or an ASTABLE (FREE-RUNNING) MULTI-VIBRATOR. When a
blocking oscillator is used as a master oscillator, the timing trigger pulses are usually obtained directly
from the oscillator. When a sine-wave oscillator or an astable multivibrator is used as a master oscillator,
pulse-shaping circuits are required to form the necessary timing trigger pulses. In an externally
synchronized radar system, the pulse repetition rate (prr) of the timing trigger pulses from the master
oscillator determines the prr of the transmitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">In a self-synchronized radar system, the prr of the timing trigger pulses is determined by the prr of
the modulator or transmitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Associated with every radar system is an indicator, such as a cathode-ray tube, and associated
circuitry. The indicator can present range, bearing, and elevation data in visual form so that a detected
object may be located. Trigger pulses from the synchronizer are frequently used to produce gate (or
enabling) pulses. When applied to the indicator, gate pulses perform the following functions:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Initiate and time the duration of the indicator sweep voltage
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Intensify the cathode-ray tube electron beam during the sweep period so that the echo pulses may
be displayed
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Gate a range marker generator so that range marker signals may be superimposed on the indicator
presentation
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-1 shows the time relationships of the various waveforms in a typical radar set. The timing
trigger pulses are applied to both the transmitter and the indicator. When a trigger pulse is applied to the
transmitter, a short burst of transmitter pulses (rf energy) is generated.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

into space. When this transmitter energy strikes one or more reflecting objects in its path, some of the
transmitted energy is reflected back to the antenna as echo pulses. Echo pulses from three reflecting
targets at different ranges are illustrated in figure 2-1. These echoes are converted to the corresponding
receiver output signals as shown in the figure. The larger initial and final pulses in the receiver output
signal are caused by the energy that leaks through the duplexer when a pulse is being transmitted.
</p><p class="paragraph">The indicator sweep voltage shown in figure 2-1 is initiated at the same time the transmitter is
triggered. In other applications, it may be more desirable to delay the timing trigger pulse that is to be fed
to the indicator sweep circuit. Delaying the trigger pulse will initiate the indicator sweep after a pulse is
transmitted.

pulse. When the range marks are combined (mixed) with the receiver output signal, the resulting video

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BASIC-SYNCHRONIZER-CIRCUITS-2-4-">BASIC SYNCHRONIZER CIRCUITS
</h2><p class="paragraph">The basic synchronizer circuit should meet the following three basic requirements:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. It must be free running (astable). Because the synchronizer is the heart of the radar, it must
establish the zero time reference and the prf (prr).
</p><p class="paragraph">2. It should be stable in frequency. For accurate ranging, the prr and its reciprocal, pulse-repetition
time (prt), must not change between pulses.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. The frequency must be variable to enable the radar to operate at different ranges.
Three basic synchronizer circuits can meet the above mentioned requirements. They are the SINE-
</p><p class="paragraph">WAVE OSCILLATOR, the SINGLE-SWING BLOCKING OSCILLATOR, and the MASTER-
TRIGGER (ASTABLE) MULTIVIBRATOR.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-2 shows the block diagrams and waveforms of these three synchronizers as they are used in
externally synchronized radar systems. In each case, equally spaced timing trigger pulses are produced.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Sine-Wave Oscillator Synchronizer
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the sine-wave oscillator synchronizer (figure 2-2, view A), a sine-wave oscillator is used for the
basic timing device (master oscillator). The oscillator output is applied to both an overdriven amplifier
and the radar indicator. The sine waves applied to the overdriven amplifier are shaped into square waves.
These square waves are then converted into positive and negative timing trigger pulses by means of a
short-time-constant RC differentiator.
</p><p class="paragraph">By means of a limiter, either the positive or negative trigger pulses from the RC differentiator are
removed. This leaves trigger pulses of only one polarity. For example, the limiter in view A of figure 2-2
is a negative-lobe limiter; that is, the limiter removes the negative trigger pulses and passes only positive
trigger pulses to the radar transmitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">A disadvantage of a sine-wave oscillator synchronizer is the large number of pulse-shaping circuits
required to produce the necessary timing trigger pulses.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Master Trigger (Astable) Multivibrator Synchronizer
In a master trigger (astable) multivibrator synchronizer (view B, figure 2-2), the master oscillator
</h3><p class="paragraph">generally is an astable multivibrator. The multivibrator is either ASYMMETRICAL or SYMMETRICAL.
If the multivibrator is asymmetrical, it generates rectangular waves. If the multivibrator is symmetrical, it
generates square waves. In either case, the timing trigger pulses are equally spaced after a limiter removes
undesired positive or negative lobes.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">There are two transistors in an astable multivibrator. The two output voltages are equal in amplitude,
but are 180 degrees out of phase. The output of the astable multivibrator consists of positive and negative
rectangular waves. Positive rectangular waves are applied to an RC differentiator and converted into
positive and negative trigger pulses. As in the sine-wave synchronizer, the negative trigger pulses are
removed by means of a negative-lobe limiter, and the positive pulses are applied to the transmitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Both positive and negative rectangular waves from the astable multivibrator are applied to the
indicator. One set of waves is used to intensify the cathode-ray tube electron beam for the duration of the
sweep. The other set of waves is used to gate (turn on) the range marker generator.
Single-Swing Blocking Oscillator Synchronizer
</p><p class="paragraph">In the single-swing, blocking-oscillator synchronizer, shown in view C of figure 2-2, a free-running,
single-swing blocking oscillator is generally used as the master oscillator. The advantage of the single-
swing blocking oscillator is that it generates sharp trigger pulses without additional shaping circuitry.
Timing trigger pulses of only one polarity are obtained by means of a limiter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Gating pulses for the indicator circuits are produced by applying the output of the blocking oscillator
to a one-shot multivibrator or another variable time delay circuit (not shown). Crystal-controlled
oscillators may be used when very stable frequency operation is required.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TRANSMITTERS-2-6-">TRANSMITTERS
</h2><p class="paragraph">The TRANSMITTER produces the short duration high-power rf pulses of energy that are radiated
into space by the antenna. Two main types of transmitters are now in common use. The first is the
KEYED-OSCILLATOR type. In this transmitter one stage or tube, usually a magnetron, produces the rf
pulse. The oscillator tube is keyed by a high-power dc pulse of energy generated by a separate unit called
the MODULATOR (discussed in the following section). The second type of transmitter consists of a
POWER-AMPLIFIER CHAIN. This transmitter system begins with an rf pulse of very low power. This
low-level pulse is then amplified by a series (chain) of power amplifiers to the high level of power desired
in a transmitter pulse. In most power-amplifier transmitters, each of the power-amplifier stages is pulse
modulated in a manner similar to the oscillator in the keyed-oscillator type. Because the modulator is
common to both types of transmitter systems, the operation of a typical modulator will be discussed first.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADAR-MODULATOR-2-6-">RADAR MODULATOR
</h2><p class="paragraph">The modulator controls the radar pulse width by means of a rectangular dc pulse (modulator pulse)
of the required duration and amplitude. The peak power of the transmitted rf pulse depends on the
amplitude of the modulator pulse.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-3 shows the waveforms of the trigger pulse applied by the synchronizer to the modulator,
the modulator pulse applied to the radar transmitter, and the transmitted rf pulse.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see in the figure, the modulator pulse is applied to the transmitter the instant the
modulator receives the trigger pulse from the synchronizer (T1, T2). The modulator pulse is flat on top
and has very steep leading and trailing edges. These pulse characteristics are necessary for the proper
operation of the transmitter and for the accurate determination of target range. The range timing circuits
must be triggered the instant the leading edge of the transmitted rf pulse leaves the transmitter. In this
way, the trigger pulse that controls the operation of the modulator also synchronizes the cathode-ray tube
sweep circuits and range measuring circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETRON OSCILLATORS are capable of generating rf pulses with very high peak power at
frequencies ranging from 600 to 30,000 megahertz. However, if its cathode voltage changes, the
magnetron oscillator shifts in frequency. To avoid such a frequency change, you must ensure that the
amplitude of the modulator (dc) pulse remains constant for the duration of the transmitted rf pulse. That
is, the modulator pulse must have a flat top. The range of cathode voltages over which a magnetron
oscillates in the desired frequency spectrum is relatively small.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a low voltage is applied to a magnetron, the magnetron produces a noise voltage output
instead of oscillations. If this noise enters the receiver, it can completely mask the returning echoes. If a
modulator pulse builds up and decays slowly, noise is produced at both the beginning and end of the
pulse. Therefore, for efficient radar operation, a magnetron requires a modulator pulse that has a flat top
and steep leading and trailing edges. An effective modulator pulse must perform in the following manner:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Rise from zero to its maximum value almost instantaneously
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Remain at its maximum value for the duration of the transmitted rf pulse
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Fall from its maximum value to zero almost instantaneously
</h3><p class="paragraph">In radars that require accurate range measurement, the transmitted rf pulse must have a steep leading
edge. The leading edge of the echo is used for range measurement. If the leading edge of the echo is not
steep and clearly defined, accurate range measurement is not possible. The leading and trailing edges of
echoes have the same shape as the leading and trailing edges of the transmitted rf pulse.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A transmitted rf pulse with a steep trailing edge is essential for the detection of objects at short
ranges. If the magnetron output voltage drops gradually from its maximum value to zero, it contributes
very little to the usable energy of the transmitted rf pulse. Furthermore, part of the magnetron output
voltage enters the receiver and obscures nearby object echoes.
Types of Modulators
</p><p class="paragraph">The two types of modulators are the LINE-PULSING MODULATOR and the HARD-TUBE
MODULATOR. (A hard tube is a high-vacuum electron tube.) The line-pulsing modulator stores energy
and forms pulses in the same circuit element. This element is usually the pulse-forming network. The
hard-tube modulator forms the pulse in the driver; the pulse is then amplified and applied to the
modulator. The hard tube modulator has been replaced by the line-pulsed modulator in most cases. This is
because the hard-tube modulator has lower efficiency, its circuits are more complex, a higher power
supply voltage is required, and it is more sensitive to voltage changes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The line-pulsing modulator is easier to maintain because of its less complex circuitry. Also, for a
given amount of power output, it is lighter and more compact. Because it is the principally used
modulator in modern radar, it is the only type that will be discussed.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-4 shows the basic sections of a radar modulator. They are as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">• The power supply.
</p><p class="paragraph">• The storage element (a circuit element or network used to store energy).
• The charging impedance (used to control the charge time of the storage element and to prevent
</p><p class="paragraph">short-circuiting of the power supply during the modulator pulse).

modulator switch open, the transmitter produces no power output, but the storage element stores a large
amount of energy. View B shows the modulator switch closed and the storage element discharging
through the transmitter. The energy stored by the storage element is released in the form of a high-power,
dc modulator pulse. The transmitter converts the dc modulator pulse to an rf pulse, which is radiated into
space by the radar antenna. Thus, the modulator switch is closed for the duration of a transmitted rf pulse,
but open between pulses.
</p><p class="paragraph">Many different kinds of components are used in radar modulators. The power supply generally
produces a high-voltage output, either alternating or direct current. The charging impedance may be a
resistor or an inductor. The storage element is generally a capacitor, an artificial transmission line, or a
pulse-forming network. The modulator switch is usually a thyratron.

</p><p class="paragraph">The charge path includes the primary of the pulse transformer, the dc power supply, and the charging
impedance. When the modulator switch is closed, the transmission line discharges through the series
circuit. This circuit consists of the modulator switch and the primary of the pulse transformer.
</p><p class="paragraph">The artificial transmission line is effectively an open circuit at its output end. Therefore, when the
voltage wave reaches the output end of the line, it is reflected. As the reflected wave propagates from the
output end back toward the input end of the line, it completely discharges each section of the line. When
the reflected wave reaches the input end of the line, the line is completely discharged, and the modulator
pulse ceases abruptly. If the oscillator and pulse transformer circuit impedance is properly matched to the
line impedance, the voltage pulse that appears across the transformer primary equals one-half the voltage
to which the line was initially charged.
</p><p class="paragraph">The width of the pulse generated by an artificial transmission line depends on the time required for a
voltage wave to travel from the input end to the output end of the line and back. Therefore, we can say the
pulse width depends on the velocity of propagation along the line (determined by the inductances and
capacitances of each section of the line) and the number of line sections (the length of the line).
</p><p class="paragraph">PULSE-FORMING NETWORKS.—A pulse-forming network is similar to an artificial
transmission line in that it stores energy between pulses and produces a nearly rectangular pulse. The
pulse-forming network in view B of figure 2-5 consists of inductors and capacitors so arranged that they
approximate the behavior of an artificial transmission line.
</p><p class="paragraph">Each capacitor in the artificial transmission line, shown in view A, must carry the high voltage
required for the modulator pulse. Because each capacitor must be insulated for this high voltage, an
artificial transmission line consisting of many sections would be bulky and cumbersome.
</p><p class="paragraph">The pulse-forming network, shown in view B of figure 2-5, can carry high voltage but does not
require bulky insulation on all of its capacitors. Only series capacitor C1 must have high-voltage
insulation. Because the other capacitors are in parallel with the corresponding inductors, the modulator-
pulse voltage divides nearly equally among them. Thus, except for C1, the elements of the pulse-forming
network are relatively small.
</p><p class="paragraph">Pulse-forming networks are often insulated by immersing each circuit element in oil. The network is
usually enclosed in a metal box on which the pulse width, characteristic impedance, and safe operating
voltage of the network are marked. If one element in such a network fails, the entire network must be
replaced.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Modulator Switching Devices
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltage stored in a storage-element capacitor, artificial transmission line, or pulse-forming
network must be discharged through a MODULATOR SWITCHING DEVICE. The modulator switching
device conducts for the duration of the modulator pulse and is an open circuit between pulses. Thus, the
modulator switch must perform the following four functions:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Close very quickly and then reach full conduction in a small fraction of a microsecond
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Conduct large currents (tens or hundreds of amperes) and withstand large voltages (thousands of
volts)
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Cease conducting (become an open circuit) with the same speed that it starts to conduct
4. Consume only a very small fraction of the power that passes through it
</p><p class="paragraph">These switching and conducting requirements are met best by the THYRATRON tube. The thyratron
tube is normally held below cutoff by a negative grid voltage and conducts when a positive trigger pulse
is applied to its grid. Once fired, the thyratron tube continues to conduct as long as the storage element
(artificial transmission line or pulse-forming network) is discharging.
</p><p class="paragraph">During discharge of the storage element, the gas in the thyratron tube is highly ionized. While the
storage element discharges, the plate-to-cathode resistance of the thyratron is practically zero. When the
storage element is completely discharged, current ceases to flow through the thyratron and the gases
become deionized; the negative grid bias regains control, and the thyratron is cut off (the modulator
switch opens).
</p><p class="paragraph">Most radar modulators use a high-voltage, dc power supply. Typical dc power supplies for radar
modulators use a half-wave rectifier, a full-wave rectifier, or a bridge rectifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">The modulator charging impedance, shown in figure 2-7, prevents the dc power supply from
becoming short-circuited when the modulator switch closes. When the modulator switch is open, the
charging impedance also controls the rate at which the storage element charges. When the charging
impedance is small, the storage element charges rapidly.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The magnetron is an electron tube in which a magnetic (H) field between the cathode and plate is
perpendicular to an electric (E) field. Tuned circuits, in the form of cylindrical cavities in the plate,
produce rf electric fields. Electrons interact with these fields in the space between the cathode and plate to
produce an ac power output. Magnetrons function as self-excited microwave oscillators. These
multicavity devices may be used in radar transmitters as either pulsed or cw oscillators at frequencies
ranging from approximately 600 to 30,000 megahertz. (If you wish to review magnetron operation in
more detail, refer to NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles.)
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s examine the following characteristics of a magnetron used as a pulse radar transmitter oscillator
stage:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Stability

</h3><h3 class="subsection">• The magnet
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Output coupling
</h3><h3 class="subsection">Stability
</h3><p class="paragraph">In speaking of a magnetron oscillator, STABILITY usually refers to the stability of the mode of
operation of the magnetron. The two main types of mode instability are MODE SKIPPING and MODE
SHIFTING.
</p><p class="paragraph">Mode skipping (or misfiring) is a condition in which the magnetron fires randomly in an undesired,
interfering mode during some pulse times, but not in others. Pulse characteristics and tube noises are
factors in mode skipping.
</p><p class="paragraph">Mode shifting is a condition in which the magnetron changes from one mode to another during pulse
time. This is highly undesirable and does not occur if the modulator pulse is of the proper shape, unless
the cathode of the magnetron is in very poor condition.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Pulse Characteristics
</h3><p class="paragraph">PULSE CHARACTERISTICS are the make up of the high-voltage modulator pulse that is applied to
the magnetron. The pulse should have a steep leading edge, a flat top, and a steep trailing edge. If the
leading edge is not steep, the magnetron may begin to oscillate before the pulse reaches its maximum
level. Since these low-power oscillations will occur in a different mode, the mode of the magnetron will
be shifted as the pulse reaches maximum power. This mode shifting will result in an undesirable
magnetron output. For the same reason (to prevent mode shifting), the top of the modulator pulse should
be as flat as possible. Variations in the applied operating power will cause variations in the mode of
operation. The trailing edge of the pulse should also be steep for the same reason--to prevent mode
shifting.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Magnet
</h3><p class="paragraph">The purpose of the MAGNET is to produce a fairly uniform magnetic field of the desired value over
the interaction space between the cathode and plate of the magnetron. The strength of the magnet is
critical for proper operation. If the magnetic field strength is too high, the magnetron will not oscillate. If
the magnetic field strength is too low, the plate current will be excessive and power output will be low.
Frequency of operation will also be affected.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Since the strength of the magnet is critical, you should be careful when handling the magnet. Striking
the magnet, especially with a ferromagnetic object, will misalign the molecular structure of the magnet
and decrease the field strength.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Output Coupling
</h3><p class="paragraph">The OUTPUT COUPLING transfers the rf energy from the magnetron to the output transmission
line (coaxial line or waveguide). A number of considerations impose restrictions upon the output circuit.
The wavelength (frequency) and the power level of the magnetron output energy determine whether the
transmission line to the antenna will be waveguide or coaxial line.
</p><p class="paragraph">The coaxial output circuit consists of a length of coaxial line in which the center conductor is shaped
into a loop and inserted into one of the magnetron cavities for magnetic coupling. The load side of the
coupling line may feed either an external coaxial line or a waveguide. If the external line is coaxial, the
connection may be direct or by means of choke joints. If the external line is a waveguide, the output
circuit must include a satisfactory junction from the coaxial line to the waveguide. One type of junction
used quite often is the PROBE COUPLER. The probe coupler acts as an antenna radiating into the
waveguide.
</p><p class="paragraph">The waveguide output may be fed directly by an opening (slot) into one of the magnetron cavities, as
shown in figure 2-9. This opening must be covered by an iris window to maintain the vacuum seal.
</p><p class="paragraph">The peak power ratings of magnetrons range from a few thousand watts (kilowatts) to several million
watts (megawatts). The average power ratings are much lower, however, and vary from a few watts to
several kilowatts. Additionally, many of the magnetrons used in modern radar systems are tunable in
frequency. Typically, a tunable magnetron can vary the output frequency – 5 percent about the center of
its frequency band. Thus the carrier frequency of radar can be changed to obtain the best operation or
avoid electronic jamming on a particular frequency.
</p><p class="paragraph">Modulator signals of many thousands of volts are applied to the magnetron cathode during operation.
These high voltage levels require large glass posts to insulate the cathode and filaments from the anode
block. In some high-power magnetrons, the cathode is completely enclosed in a container filled with
insulating oil.

</h2><p class="paragraph">POWER-AMPLIFIER TRANSMITTERS are used in many recently developed radar sets. This type
of transmitter was developed because of the need for more stable operation of the moving target indicator
(mti). In a magnetron transmitting system, the high-power magnetron oscillator has a tendency to drift in
frequency because of temperature variations, changes in the modulating pulse, and various other effects.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Frequency drift is compensated for, in part, by the use of automatic frequency control (afc) circuits
designed to control the frequency of the local oscillator in the receiver system. This, however, does not
completely eliminate the undesirable effects of frequency drift on mti operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">The power-amplifier transmitter system does the same thing as the keyed-oscillator transmitter but
with fewer stability problems. It generates, shapes, and amplifies pulses of rf energy for transmission.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-10 is a block diagram of a typical power-amplifier transmitter system. In this transmitter
system a multicavity klystron tube amplifies lower-powered rf pulses that have been generated and
shaped in other stages. CROSSED-FIELD AMPLIFIERS (AMPLITRONS) are used in radar systems
with a wide band of transmitted frequencies because they are stable over a wider frequency range. A
crossed-field amplifier transmitter is discussed later in this section.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 2-10, the power-amplifier chain input signals are generated by heterodyning (mixing) two
frequencies. That is, two different frequencies are fed to a mixer stage (mixer amplifier) and the resultant,
either the sum or difference frequency, may be selected as the output. (The operation of mixer circuits is
explained in more detail in the section on receivers.) The low-power pulse is then amplified by
intermediate power amplifier stages and applied to the klystron power-amplifier. The klystron power-
amplifier concentrates the rf output energy into a very narrow frequency spectrum. This concentration
makes the system more sensitive to smaller targets. In addition the detection range of all targets is
increased.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">To examine the operation of the transmitter, we will trace the signal through the entire circuit. The
local oscillator shown at the left of figure 2-10 is a very stable rf oscillator that produces two cw rf
outputs. As shown, the cw output is sent to the receiver system; the cw output is also one of the two rf
signals fed to the mixer amplifier by way of the two BUFFER AMPLIFIER STAGES. The buffer
amplifiers raise the power level of the signal and also isolate the local oscillator.
</p><p class="paragraph">The COHERENT OSCILLATOR (COHO) is triggered by the system trigger and produces as its
output an rf pulse. This rf pulse is fed directly to the mixer amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">The mixer-amplifier stage receives three signals: the coherent rf pulse, the local oscillator cw rf
signal, and a dc modulating pulse from the low-voltage modulator. The coherent and local oscillator
signals are mixed to produce sum and difference frequency signals. Either of these may be selected as the
output. The modulator pulse serves the same purpose as in the keyed-oscillator transmitter, because it
determines the pulse width and power level. The mixer stage functions only during the modulator pulse
time. Thus the mixer amplifier produces an output of rf pulses in which the frequency may be either the
sum or difference of the coherent and local oscillator signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">The mixer-amplifier feeds the pulses of rf energy to an intermediate power amplifier. This amplifier
stage is similar to the buffer-amplifier stage except that it is a pulsed amplifier. That is, the pulsed
amplifier has operating power only during the time the modulator pulse from the low-voltage modulator
is applied to the stage. The amplified output signal is fed to a second intermediate power amplifier that
operates in the same manner as the first.
</p><p class="paragraph">From the second intermediate power amplifier, the signal is fed to the KLYSTRON POWER
AMPLIFIER. This stage is a multicavity power klystron. The input rf signal is used as the exciter signal
for the first cavity. High-voltage modulating pulses from the high-voltage modulator are also applied to
the klystron power amplifier. These high-voltage modulating pulses are stepped up across a pulse
transformer before being applied to the klystron. All cavities of the klystron are tunable and are tuned for
maximum output at the desired frequency.
</p><p class="paragraph">Provisions are made in this type of transmitter to adjust the starting time of the modulating pulses
applied to the coherent oscillator, mixer amplifier, intermediate power amplifiers, and klystron power-
amplifier. By this means the various modulator pulses are made to occur at the same time.
</p><p class="paragraph">This transmitter produces output rf pulses of constant power and minimum frequency modulation
and ensures good performance.

transmitters?

Figure 2-11 is a block diagram of a power-amplifier transmitter that uses a FREQUENCY
</p><p class="paragraph">SYNTHESIZER to produce the transmitted frequency rather than the heterodyning mixer. The frequency
synthesizer allows the transmitter to radiate a large number of discrete frequencies over a relatively wide
band. Such a system is commonly used with frequency-scan search radars that must transmit many
different frequencies to achieve elevation coverage and to compensate for the roll and pitch of a ship.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A typical frequency synthesizer consists of a bank of oscillators producing different fixed
frequencies. The outputs of a relatively few fixed oscillators can be mixed in various combinations to
produce a wide range of frequencies. In mti systems the selected oscillator frequencies are mixed with a
coherent oscillator frequency to provide a stable reference for the mti circuits. The frequency synthesizer
also produces the local oscillator signals for the receiver system. Because the transmitted pulse changes
frequency on each transmission, the local oscillator signal to the receiver must also change and be
included in the transmitted frequency. A system of this type is frequency-programmed by select gates
from the synchronizer.
</p><p class="paragraph">The detailed operation of frequency synthesizers is beyond the scope of this manual but may be
found in the technical manuals for most frequency scan radar systems.
</p><p class="paragraph">The first rf amplifier receives the pulses of the selected frequency from the synthesizer and a
modulator pulse (from the first stage modulator) at the same time. The rf pulse is usually slightly wider
than the modulator pulse which prevents the amplifier tube from pulsing when no rf energy is present.
Most pulsed rf amplifiers will oscillate at an undesired frequency if pulsed without an rf input. The output
of the first rf amplifier is an amplified rf pulse that is the same width as the first stage modulator pulse.
The second stage modulator is designed to produce a pulse slightly narrower than the first stage
modulator pulse; this also prevents the amplifier from pulsing when no rf is present. Therefore, the second
stage amplifier receives a modulator pulse a short time after the first stage rf arrives at the input. As
shown in figure 2-11, the same procedure is repeated in the third and final stage.
</p><p class="paragraph">The amplifiers in this type of power-amplifier transmitter must be broad-band microwave amplifiers
that amplify the input signals without frequency distortion. Typically, the first stage and the second stage
are traveling-wave tubes (twt) and the final stage is a crossed-field amplifier. Recent technological</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">advances in the field of solid-state microwave amplifiers have produced solid-state amplifiers with
enough output power to be used as the first stage in some systems. Transmitters with more than three
stages usually use crossed-field amplifiers in the third and any additional stages. Both traveling-wave
tubes and crossed-field amplifiers have a very flat amplification response over a relatively wide frequency
range.
</p><p class="paragraph">Crossed-field amplifiers have another advantage when used as the final stages of a transmitter; that
is, the design of the crossed-field amplifier allows rf energy to pass through the tube virtually unaffected
when the tube is not pulsed. When no pulse is present, the tube acts as a section of waveguide. Therefore,
if less than maximum output power is desired, the final and preceding cross-field amplifier stages can be
shut off as needed. This feature also allows a transmitter to operate at reduced power, even when the final
crossed-field amplifier is defective.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DUPLEXERS-2-20-">DUPLEXERS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Whenever a single antenna is used for both transmitting and receiving, as in a radar system,
problems arise. Switching the antenna between the transmit and receive modes presents one problem;
ensuring that maximum use is made of the available energy is another. The simplest solution is to use a
switch to transfer the antenna connection from the receiver to the transmitter during the transmitted pulse
and back to the receiver during the return (echo) pulse. No practical mechanical switches are available
that can open and close in a few microseconds. Therefore, ELECTRONIC SWITCHES must be used.
Switching systems of this type are called DUPLEXERS.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BASIC-DUPLEXER-OPERATION-2-20-">BASIC DUPLEXER OPERATION
</h2><p class="paragraph">In selecting a switch for this task, you must remember that protection of the receiver input circuit is
as important as are output power considerations. At frequencies where amplifiers may be used, amplifier
tubes can be chosen to withstand large input powers without damage. However, the input circuit of the
receiver is easily damaged by large applied signals and must be carefully protected.
</p><p class="paragraph">An effective radar duplexing system must meet the following four requirements:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. During the period of transmission, the switch must connect the antenna to the transmitter and
disconnect it from the receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The receiver must be thoroughly isolated from the transmitter during the transmission of the high-
power pulse to avoid damage to sensitive receiver components.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. After transmission, the switch must rapidly disconnect the transmitter and connect the receiver to
the antenna. For targets close to the radar to be seen, the action of the switch must be extremely
rapid.
</p><p class="paragraph">4. The switch should absorb an absolute minimum of power both during transmission and reception.
</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, a radar duplexer is the microwave equivalent of a fast, low-loss, single-pole, double-
throw switch. The devices developed for this purpose are similar to spark gaps in which high-current
microwave discharges furnish low-impedance paths. A duplexer usually contains two switching tubes</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

transmitter, receiver, and antenna. As shown in views A and B of figure 2-12, these circuits may be
connected in parallel or in series. Both systems will be discussed in detail in this section. One tube is
called the TRANSMIT-RECEIVER TUBE, or TR TUBE; the other is called the ANTITRANSMIT-
RECEIVE TUBE, or ATR TUBE. The tr tube has the primary function of disconnecting the receiver, and
the atr tube of disconnecting the transmitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">The overall action of the tr and atr circuits depends upon the impedance characteristics of the
quarter-wavelength section of transmission line. A quarter-wavelength, or an odd multiple of the quarter-
wavelength, transmission line presents opposite impedance values at the ends; one end of the line appears
as a short and the other end appears as an open.
</p><h3 class="subsection">TR Tube
</h3><p class="paragraph">The type of spark gap used as a tr tube may vary. It may be one that is simply formed by two
electrodes placed across the transmission line; or it may be one enclosed in an evacuated glass envelope
with special features to improve operation. The requirements of the spark gap are (1) high impedance
prior to the arc and (2) very low impedance during arc time. At the end of the transmitted pulse the arc</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">should be extinguished as rapidly as possible. Extinguishing the arc stops any loss caused by the arc and
permits signals from nearby targets to reach the receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">The simple gap formed in air has a resistance during conduction of from 30 to 50 ohms. This is
usually too high for use with any but an open-wire transmission line. The time required for the air
surrounding the gap to completely deionize after the pulse voltage has been removed is about 10
microseconds. During this time the gap acts as an increasing resistance across the transmission line to
which it is connected. However, in a tr system using an air gap, the echo signals reaching the receiver
beyond the gap will be permitted to increase to half their proper magnitude 3 microseconds after the pulse
voltage has been removed. This interval is known as RECOVERY TIME.
</p><p class="paragraph">Tr tubes are usually conventional spark gaps enclosed in partially evacuated, sealed glass envelopes,
as shown in figure 2-13. The arc is formed as electrons are conducted through the ionized gas or vapor.
You may lower the magnitude of voltage necessary to break down a gap by reducing the pressure of the
gas that surrounds the electrodes. Optimum pressure achieves the most efficient tr operation. You can
reduce the recovery time, or DEIONIZATION TIME, of the gap by introducing water vapor into the tr
tube. A tr tube containing water vapor at a pressure of 1 millimeter of mercury will recover in 0.5
microseconds. It is important for a tr tube to have a short recovery time to reduce the range at which
targets near the radar can be detected. If, for example, echo signals reflected from nearby objects return to
the radar before the tr tube has recovered, those signals will be unable to enter the receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">Tr tubes used at microwave frequencies are built to fit into, and become a part of, a resonant cavity.
You may increase the speed with which the gap breaks down after the transmitter fires by placing a
voltage across the gap electrodes. This potential is known as KEEP-ALIVE VOLTAGE and ranges from
100 volts to 1,000 volts. A glow discharge is maintained between the electrodes. (The term GLOW
DISCHARGE refers to the discharge of electricity through a gas-filled electron tube. This is distinguished
by a cathode glow and voltage drop much higher than the gas-ionization voltage in the cathode vicinity.)
This action provides for rapid ionization when the transmitter pulse arrives.
</p><p class="paragraph">Failure of the tr tube is primarily caused by two factors. The first and most common cause of failure
is the gradual buildup of metal particles that have been dislodged from the electrodes. Such metal bits
become spattered on the inside of the glass envelope. These particles act as small, conducting areas and
tend to lower the Q of the resonant cavity and dissipate power. If the tube continues in use for too long a</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">period in this condition, the particles will form a detuning wall within the cavity and eventually prevent
the tube from functioning. A second cause of failure is the absorption of gas within the enclosure by the
metal electrodes. This results in a gradual reduction of pressure within the tube to a point where gap
breakdown becomes very difficult. The final result is that extremely strong signals (from the transmitter)
are coupled to the receiver. Because both types of failures develop gradually, the tr tube periodically must
be checked carefully to determine performance level.

</p><h3 class="subsection">ATR Tube
</h3><p class="paragraph">The atr tube is usually a simpler device than a tr tube. An atr tube might use a pure inert gas, such as
argon, because recovery time generally is not a vital factor. Furthermore, a priming agent, such as keep-
alive voltage, is not needed. The absence of either a chemically active gas or a keep-alive voltage results
in atr tubes having longer useful lives than tr tubes.

to act as shorted (closed-end) quarter-wave stubs. The circuits then reflect an open circuit to the tr and atr
circuit connections to the main transmission line. None of the transmitted energy can pass through these
reflected opens into the atr stub or into the receiver. Therefore, all of the transmitted energy is directed to
the antenna.

</h3><p class="paragraph">In the SERIES-CONNECTED DUPLEXER SYSTEM, shown in figure 2-17, the tr spark gap is
located one-half wavelength from the receiver T-junction. The atr spark gap is located one-half
wavelength from the transmission line and three-quarters wavelength from the receiver T-junction.
During transmission, the tr and atr gaps fire in the series-connected duplexer system, as shown in figure
2-18. This causes a short-circuit to be reflected at the series connection to the main transmission line one-
half wavelength away. The transmitted pulse "sees" a low impedance path in the direction of the antenna
and does not go into the atr stub or the receiver.

terminated in an open. This open is reflected as a short-circuit at the T-junction three-quarters of a

of the received signal is lost in the transmitting circuit.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Waveguide Duplexer
</h3><p class="paragraph">WAVEGUIDE DUPLEXERS usually consist of tr tubes and atr tubes housed in a resonant cavity
and attached to a waveguide system in some manner. Resonant-cavity tr tubes may be applied to
waveguides, either directly or indirectly, to obtain switching action. The indirect method uses a coaxial
line system, and then couples the coaxial line into the waveguide that feeds the antenna. If large losses are
incurred by the use of a coaxial line, the resonant cavity can be coupled directly to the waveguide. Figure
2-20 shows a direct method of cavity tr switching in a waveguide system. The waveguide terminates in
the antenna at one end and in a shorting plate at the other. The magnetron uses a voltage probe to excite
the waveguide. The transmitted pulse travels up the guide and moves into the tr box through a slot. The
cavity builds up a strong electric field across the gap, breaks it down, and detunes the cavity. This action
effectively seals the opening and passes the pulse energy to the antenna.
</p><p class="paragraph">The signals received during the resting time travel down the guide to the magnetron and the shorting
end plate where they are reflected. The slot coupling the waveguide to the cavity is located at a point
where the standing-wave magnetic field produced by reflections in the waveguide is maximum. The
maximum magnetic field, therefore, energizes the cavity. The echo signals are not strong enough to cause
an arc, and the cavity field is undisturbed by the gap. Therefore, the cavity field couples rf energy into the
receiver coaxial line and provides maximum energy transfer.
</p><p class="paragraph">The cavity tr switch can also be applied to branch lines of the waveguide, as shown in figure 2-21.
The magnetron is coupled to the guide by a voltage probe to produce proper excitation.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Maximum use of the received signals is ensured by an atr tube. The transmitted pulse travels from
the magnetron to the atr branch where part of the energy is diverted into the gap. A slot (S) is placed
across the waveguide one-half wavelength from the main guide, and passes the rf energy through it and
into the cavity. The cavity builds up the electric field that breaks down the gap, detunes the cavity, and, as
a result, effectively closes the slot. One-half wavelength away, this action effectively closes the entrance
to the atr branch and limits the amount of energy entering the atr branch to a small value.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most of the energy is, therefore, directed down the guide to the antenna. Upon reaching the receiver
branch, the same effect is produced by the tr tube in the receiver line. Because the energy entering both
openings is effectively limited by the gaps, maximum energy is transferred between the magnetron and
the antenna.
</p><p class="paragraph">During the resting time, the atr spark gap is not broken down by the received signals. The received
signal sets up standing waves within the cavity that cause it to resonate. At resonance, the low impedance
of the atr cavity is reflected as a high impedance at the entrance to the transmitter waveguide (three-
quarter wavelength away). This ensures that the maximum received signal will enter the receiver branch.
Hybrid Ring Duplexer
</p><p class="paragraph">The HYBRID RING is used as a duplexer in high-power radar systems. It is very effective in
isolating the receiver during transmission. A simplified version of the hybrid-ring duplexer is shown in
views A and B of figure 2-22. The operation of the duplexer, in terms of the E field distribution during
transmission and reception, is illustrated in views C and D. The H lines, though present, have been
omitted to simplify the explanation.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">During transmission the E field from the transmitter enters arm 3 and divides into two fields 180
degrees out of phase. One field moves clockwise around the ring and the other moves counterclockwise.
The two fields must be 180 degrees out of phase at the entrance of an arm to propagate any energy down
the arm. The field moving clockwise from arm 3 ionizes the tr tube in arm 4, and the energy is blocked
from the receiver. The tr tube reflects a high impedance equivalent to an open circuit. This high
impedance prevents any energy from entering the receiver - even though the two fields are out of phase at
the entrance to arm 4. The field moving counterclockwise from arm 3 ionizes the tr tube in arm 2, which
reflects a short circuit back to the ring junction. No energy is sent to the receiver, however, because the
fields arriving at arm 2 are in phase. The clockwise and counterclockwise fields arrive at arm 1 out of
phase by 180 degrees. They are then propagated through the arm to the antenna.
</p><p class="paragraph">During reception, the relatively weak field from the antenna enters arm 1 and divides at the junction
into two out-of-phase components. Neither field is sufficient to fire the tr tubes in arms 2 and 4; since the
fields arrive at these arms out of phase, energy is propagated to the receiver. The energy arriving at arm 3
is in phase and will not be coupled to the transmitter. Since the operation of the arms of a hybrid ring is
the same as the operation of E-type waveguide T-junctions, you may find it helpful to review NEETS,
Module 11, Microwave Principles.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The energy that a distant object reflects back to the antenna in a radar system is a very small fraction
of the original transmitted energy. The echoes return as pulses of rf energy of the same nature as those
sent out by the transmitter. However, the power of a return pulse is measured in fractions of microwatts
instead of in kilowatts, and the voltage arriving at the antenna is in the range of microvolts instead of
kilovolts. The radar receiver collects those pulses and provides a visual display of object information.
</p><p class="paragraph">Information about the position of the object is present visually when the reception of an echo causes
the movement or appearance of a spot of light on a cathode-ray tube (crt). The crt requires a signal on the
order of at least several volts for proper operation and will not respond to the high frequencies within a
return pulse. Therefore, a receiver amplifier and detector must be used that are capable of producing a
visible indication on the cathode-ray tube under the following conditions: (1) when the input signal to the
amplifier is in the form of pulses of extremely high-frequency, (2) the amplitude of the pulses is in the
microvolt range, and (3) the pulses last for only a few microseconds.
</p><p class="paragraph">The radar receiver evolved directly from the simple radio receiver. The radar receiver operates on
exactly the same principles as the radio receiver. However, the overall requirements and limitations of a
radar receiver differ somewhat from those of a radio receiver because of the higher frequencies involved
and the greater sensitivity desired.
</p><p class="paragraph">In studying the radar receiver, we will first examine the overall requirements of a radar receiver.
Second, we will examine a typical radar receiver that satisfies these requirements. Finally, we will discuss
the individual components of the receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">RADAR RECEIVER REQUIREMENTS
The following characteristics determine the design requirements of an effective radar receiver:

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">2-31
</p><h3 class="subsection">Noise
</h3><p class="paragraph">The word NOISE is a carryover from sound-communications equipment terminology. Noise voltages
in sound equipment produce actual noise in the loudspeaker output. In radar, noise voltages result in
erratic, random deflection or intensity of the indicator sweep that can mask small return signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">Were it not for noise, the maximum range at which an object would be detectable by radar could be
extended almost infinitely. Objects at great range return exceedingly small echoes. However, without
noise, almost any signal could be amplified to a usable level if enough stages were added to the receiver.
Because of noise, the signal detection limit or sensitivity level of a receiver is reached when the signal
level falls below the noise level to such an extent as to be obscured. A simple increase of amplification is
of no help because both signal and noise are amplified at the same rate.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the radar portion of the rf spectrum, external sources of noise interference are usually negligible;
consequently, the sensitivity that can be achieved in a radar receiver is usually determined by the noise
produced in the receiver. Not only must noise be kept down, but everything possible must be done to
minimize attenuation of the video signal (echo) before it is amplified.
Gain
</p><p class="paragraph">The GAIN of a radar receiver must be very high. This is because the strength of the signal at the
antenna is at a level of microvolts and the required output to the indicator is several volts. The gain of a
radar receiver is roughly in the range of 106 to 10 8. FEEDBACK, or REGENERATION, is one of the
most serious difficulties in the design of an amplifier with such high gain. Special precautions must be
taken to avoid feedback. Such precautions include careful shielding, decoupling (isolation) between
voltage supplies for the different tubes, and amplification at different frequencies in separate groups of
stages.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tuning
</h3><p class="paragraph">The radar receiver requires a limited tuning range to compensate for transmitter and local oscillator
frequency changes because of variations in temperature and loading. Microwave radar receivers usually
use automatic frequency control (afc) for this purpose.
Distortion
</p><p class="paragraph">If distortion occurs in the receiver, the time interval between the transmitted pulse and the received
pulse changes, thereby affecting range accuracy.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Blocking
</h3><p class="paragraph">BLOCKING refers to a condition of the receiver in which the voltage pulse at the receiver input is
too large. As a result, for a short time after the pulse, the receiver is insensitive or blocked to signals
below a certain level. This condition results from one or more of the amplifier stages in the receiver being
overdriven. After a strong pulse, the receiver may be biased to a point at which it will not amplify small
signals. Recovery after blocking may be only a fraction of a microsecond, or it may take several hundred
microseconds, depending upon the point in the receiver at which blocking occurs. To detect a weak echo
immediately following a strong one, the receiver must have a short BLOCKING RECOVERY TIME.
The blocking itself must be minimized as much as possible. If a portion of the transmitted pulse leaks into
the receiver input, then the receiver may be blocked and not show small, nearby objects. In most
receivers, blocking is minimized from this cause by a duplexer. The duplexer protects the receiver by
isolating it during the transmitted pulse.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RECEIVER-BLOCK-DIAGRAM-2-32-">RECEIVER BLOCK DIAGRAM
</h2><p class="paragraph">The SUPERHETERODYNE receiver is almost always used in microwave radar systems. A typical
superheterodyne radar receiver is shown in figure 2-23. A receiver of this type meets all the requirements
listed above. Signals from the antenna enter the receiver via the duplexer. A low-noise rf amplifier is
usually the first stage of modern radar receivers. Some receivers, however, send the antenna signal
directly to the mixer, as shown by the dashed path. The low-noise amplifiers used in modern systems are
usually solid-state devices, such as tunnel-diode, parametric, or microwave transistor amplifiers.
</p><p class="paragraph">The MIXER stage is often called the FIRST DETECTOR. The function of this stage is to convert the
received rf energy to a lower, intermediate frequency (IF) that is easier to amplify and manipulate
electronically. The intermediate frequency is usually 30 or 60 megahertz. It is obtained by heterodyning
the received signal with a local-oscillator signal in the mixer stage. The mixer stage converts the received
signal to the lower IF signal without distorting the data on the received signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">After conversion to the intermediate frequency, the signal is amplified in several IF AMPLIFIER
stages. Most of the gain of the receiver is developed in the IF amplifier stages. The overall bandwidth of
the receiver is often determined by the bandwidth of the IF stages.
</p><p class="paragraph">The output of the IF amplifiers is applied to the SECOND DETECTOR. It is then rectified and
passed through one or more stages of amplification in the video amplifier(s). The output stage of the
receiver is normally an emitter follower. The low-impedance output of the emitter follower matches the
impedance of the cable. The video pulses are coupled through the cable to the indicator for video display
on the crt.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">As in all superheterodyne receivers, controlling the frequency of the local oscillator keeps the
receiver tuned. Since this tuning is critical, some form of automatic frequency control (afc) is essential to
avoid constant manual tuning. Automatic frequency control circuits mix an attenuated portion of the
transmitted signal with the local oscillator signal to form an IF signal. This signal is applied to a
frequency-sensitive discriminator that produces an output voltage proportional in amplitude and polarity
to any change in IF frequency. If the IF signal is at the discriminator center frequency, no discriminator
output occurs. The center frequency of the discriminator is essentially a reference frequency for the IF
signal. The output of the DISCRIMINATOR provides a control voltage to maintain the local oscillator at
the correct frequency.
</p><p class="paragraph">Different receiving systems may vary in the type of coupling between stages, the type of mixer, the
detector, the local oscillator, and the number of stages of amplification at the different frequencies.
However, the receiver is always designed to have as little noise as possible. It is also designed to have
sufficient gain so that noise, rather than lack of gain, limits the smallest visible signal.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RECEIVER-COMPONENTS-2-33-">RECEIVER COMPONENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">This section will analyze in more detail the operation of the receiver circuits mentioned above. The
circuits discussed are usually found in some form in all radar superheterodyne receivers.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Low-Noise Amplifier
</h3><p class="paragraph">LOW-NOISE AMPLIFIERS, sometimes called PREAMPS, are found in most modern radar
receivers. As previously mentioned, these amplifiers are usually solid-state microwave amplifiers. The
most common types are tunnel diode and parametric amplifiers. These amplifiers are discussed in detail in
NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles. Some older systems may still use a traveling-wave tube (twt)
as a low-noise first stage amplifier. However, the solid-state amplifiers produce lower noise levels and
more gain.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Local Oscillator
</h3><p class="paragraph">Most radar receivers use a 30 or 60 megahertz intermediate frequency. The IF is produced by mixing
a local oscillator signal with the incoming signal. The local oscillator is, therefore, essential to efficient
operation and must be both tunable and very stable. For example, if the local oscillator frequency is 3,000
megahertz, a frequency change of 0.1 percent will produce a frequency shift of 3 megahertz. This is equal
to the bandwidth of most receivers and would greatly decrease receiver gain.
</p><p class="paragraph">The power output requirement for most local oscillators is small (20 to 50 milliwatts) because most
receivers use crystal mixers that require very little power.
</p><p class="paragraph">The local oscillator output frequency must be tunable over a range of several megahertz in the 4,000-
megahertz region. The local oscillator must compensate for any changes in the transmitted frequency and
maintain a constant 30 or 60 megahertz difference between the oscillator and the transmitter frequency. A
local oscillator that can be tuned by varying the applied voltage is most desirable.
</p><p class="paragraph">The REFLEX KLYSTRON is often used as a local oscillator because it meets all the requirements
mentioned above. The reflex klystron is a very stable microwave oscillator that can be tuned by changing
the repeller voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most radar systems use an automatic frequency control (afc) circuit to control the output of the local
oscillator. A block diagram of a typical afc circuit is included in figure 2-23. Note that the afc circuits
form a closed loop. This circuit is, in fact, often called the afc loop.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A sample of the transmitter energy is fed through the afc mixer and an IF amplifier to a
discriminator. The output of the discriminator is a dc error voltage that indicates the degree of mistuning
between the transmitter and the local oscillator. In this particular example let’s assume that the IF is 30
megahertz. If the output of the mixer is correct, the discriminator will have no output. If the mixer output
is above 30 megahertz, the output of the discriminator will be positive dc pulses; if the mixer output is
below 30 megahertz, the discriminator output will be negative dc pulses. In either case, this output is fed
through an amplifier to the control circuit. The control circuit adjusts the operating frequency of the local
oscillator so that no mistuning exists and the IF is 30 megahertz. In this example the local oscillator is a
reflex klystron and the control circuit provides he repeller plate voltage for the klystron; thus, the klystron
directly controls the local oscillator frequency. In this manner the local oscillator is maintained exactly 30
megahertz below the transmitter frequency.

</p><p class="paragraph">produce the IF signal?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Mixer
</h3><p class="paragraph">Many older radar receivers do not use a low-noise amplifier as the receiver front end; they simply
send the echo signal directly to a crystal mixer stage. A crystal is used rather than an electron-tube diode
because, at microwave frequencies, the tube would generate excessive noise. Electron tubes are also
limited by the effects of transit time at microwave frequencies. The crystal most commonly used is the
point-contact crystal diode; however, recent developments in the field of solid-state microwave devices
may soon replace the point-contact diode with devices that produce even less noise. The Schottky-barrier
diode is an example of a relatively recent development that produces less noise than the point-contact
crystal.
</p><p class="paragraph">The simplest type of radar mixer is the SINGLE ENDED or UNBALANCED CRYSTAL MIXER,
shown in figure 2-24. The mixer illustrated uses a tuned section of coaxial transmission line one-half
wavelength long. This section matches the crystal to the signal echo and the local oscillator inputs. Local
oscillator injection is accomplished by means of a probe. In the coaxial assembly, the signal is injected by
means of a slot. This slot would normally be inserted in the duplexer waveguide assembly and be properly
oriented to provide coupling of the returned signal. In this application, the unwanted signals at the output
of the mixer (carrier frequency, the local oscillator frequency, and sum of these two signals) are
effectively eliminated by a resonant circuit tuned to the intermediate, or difference frequency. One
advantage of the unbalanced crystal mixer is its simplicity. It has one major disadvantage; its inability to
cancel local oscillator noise. Difficulty in detecting weak signals will exist if noise is allowed to pass
through the mixer along with the signal.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

(sometimes called the MAGIC T). Figure 2-25 shows this type of mixer. In hybrid mixers, crystals are
inserted directly into the waveguide. The crystals are located one-quarter wavelength from their
respective short-circuited waveguide ends (a point of maximum voltage along a tuned line). The crystals
are also connected to a balanced transformer, the secondary of which is tuned to the desired IF. The local
oscillator signal is introduced into the waveguide local oscillator arm and distributes itself as shown in

</p><p class="paragraph">A difference in phase exists between echo signals applied across the two crystals. The signal applied
to the crystals from the local oscillator is in phase. Therefore, at some point both signals applied to crystal
#1 will be in phase, and the signals applied to crystal #2 will be out of phase. This means that an IF signal
of one polarity will be produced across crystal #1 and an IF signal of the opposite polarity will be
produced across crystal #2. When these two signals are applied to the balanced output transformer (figure
2-25), they will add. Outputs of the same polarity will cancel across the balanced transformer.

</p><h3 class="subsection">IF Amplifier Stage
</h3><p class="paragraph">The IF AMPLIFIER SECTION of a radar receiver determines the gain, signal-to-noise ratio, and
effective bandwidth of the receiver. The typical IF amplifier (commonly called an IF strip) usually
contains from three to ten amplifier stages. The IF amplifier has the capability to vary both the bandpass
and the gain of a receiver. Normally, the bandpass is as narrow as possible without affecting the actual
signal energy. When a selection of pulse widths is available, such as short and long pulses, the bandpass
must be able to match the bandwidth of the two different signals. Gain must be variable to provide a
constant voltage output for input signals of different amplitudes. Figure 2-27 is a block diagram of an IF
amplifier that meets these requirements.
</p><p class="paragraph">The most critical stage of the IF section is the input (first stage). The quality of this stage determines
the noise figure of the receiver and the performance of the entire receiving system with respect to
detection of small objects at long ranges. Gain and bandwidth are not the only considerations in the
design of the first IF stage. A consideration perhaps of more importance is noise generation. Noise
generation in this stage must be low. Noise generated in the input IF stage will be amplified by
succeeding stages and may exceed the echo signal in strength.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Detectors
</h3><p class="paragraph">The detector in a microwave receiver serves to convert the IF pulses into video pulses. After
amplification, these are applied to the indicator. The simplest form of detector, and the one most
commonly used in microwave receivers, is the DIODE DETECTOR.
</p><p class="paragraph">A diode detector circuit is shown in view A of figure 2-28. The secondary of T1 and C1 form a tuned
circuit that is resonant at the intermediate frequency. Should an echo pulse of sufficient amplitude be
received, the voltage (ei) developed across the tuned circuit is an IF pulse. Its shape is indicated by the

</h3><p class="paragraph">The video amplifier receives pulses from the detector and amplifies these pulses for application to
the indicating device. A video amplifier is fundamentally an RC coupled amplifier that uses high-gain
transistors or pentodes. However, a video amplifier must be capable of a relatively wide frequency
response. Stray and interelectrode capacitances reduce the high-frequency response of an amplifier, and
the reactance of the coupling capacitor diminishes the low-frequency response. These problems are
overcome by the use of FREQUENCY COMPENSATION NETWORKS in the video amplifier. The
types of frequency compensation networks that may be used in a video amplifier stage are discussed in
detail in NEETS, Module 8, Introduction to Amplifiers.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RECEIVER-SPECIAL-CIRCUITS-2-40-">RECEIVER SPECIAL CIRCUITS
</h2><p class="paragraph">The performance efficiency of radar receivers is often greatly decreased by interference from one or
more of several possible sources. Weather and sea return are the most common of these interference
sources, especially for radar systems that operate above 3,000 megahertz. Unfavorable weather conditions
can completely mask all radar returns and render the system useless. Electromagnetic interference from
external sources, such as the deliberate interference by an enemy, called jamming or electronic counter
measures (ECM), can also render a radar system useless. Many special circuits have been designed to
help the radar receiver counteract the effects of external interference. These circuits are called VIDEO
ENHANCEMENT FEATURES, ANTIJAMMING CIRCUITS, or ELECTRONIC COUNTER-
COUNTERMEASURES (ECCM) CIRCUITS. This section will discuss, in general terms, some of the
more common video enhancement features associated with radar receivers.
</p><p class="paragraph">Automatic Gain Control (AGC)
Most radar receivers use some means to control the overall gain. This usually involves the gain of
</p><p class="paragraph">one or more IF amplifier stages. Manual gain control by the operator is the simplest method. Usually,
some more complex form of automatic gain control (agc) or instantaneous automatic gain control (iagc) is
used during normal operation. Gain control is necessary to adjust the receiver sensitivity for the best
reception of signals of widely varying amplitudes. Agc and iagc circuits are designed with, a shut-off
feature so that receiver gain may be adjusted manually. In this way, manual gain control can be used to
adjust for best reception of a particular signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">The simplest type of agc adjusts the IF amplifier bias (and gain) according to the average level of the
received signal. Agc is not used as frequently as other types of gain control because of the widely varying
amplitudes of radar return signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">With agc, gain is controlled by the largest received signals. When several radar signals are being
received simultaneously, the weakest signal may be of greatest interest. Iagc is used more frequently
because it adjusts receiver gain for each signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">The iagc circuit is essentially a wide-band, dc amplifier. It instantaneously controls the gain of the IF
amplifier as the radar return signal changes in amplitude. The effect of iagc is to allow full amplification
of weak signals and to decrease the amplification of strong signals. The range of iagc is limited, however,
by the number of IF stages in which gain is controlled. When only one IF stage is controlled, the range of
iagc is limited to approximately 20 dB. When more than one IF stage is controlled, iagc range can be
increased to approximately 40 dB.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Sensitivity Time Control (STC)
In radar receivers, the wide variation in return signal amplitudes make adjustment of the gain
</h3><p class="paragraph">difficult. The adjustment of receiver gain for best visibility of nearby target return signals is not the best
adjustment for distant target return signals. Circuits used to adjust amplifier gain with time, during a
single pulse-repetition period, are called stc circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">Sensitivity time-control circuits apply a bias voltage that varies with time to the IF amplifiers to
control receiver gain. Figure 2-29 shows a typical stc waveform in relation to the transmitted pulse. When
the transmitter fires, the stc circuit decreases the receiver gain to zero to prevent the amplification of any
leakage energy from the transmitted pulse. At the end of the transmitted pulse, the stc voltage begins to
rise, gradually increasing the receiver gain to maximum. The stc voltage effect on receiver gain is usually
limited to approximately 50 miles. This is because close-in targets are most likely to saturate the receiver;
beyond 50 miles, stc has no affect and the receiver operates normally.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The combination of stc and iagc circuits results in better overall performance than with either type of
gain control alone. Stc decreases the amplitude of nearby target return signals, while iagc decreases the
amplitude of larger-than-average return signals. Thus, normal changes of signal amplitudes are adequately
compensated for by the combination of iagc and stc.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Antijamming Circuits
Among the many circuits used to overcome the effects of jamming, two important ones are GATED
</h3><p class="paragraph">AGC CIRCUITS and FAST-TIME-CONSTANT CIRCUITS. A gated agc circuit permits signals that
occur only in a very short time interval to develop the agc. If large-amplitude pulses from a jamming
transmitter arrive at the radar receiver at any time other than during the gating period, the agc does not
respond to these jamming pulses.
</p><p class="paragraph">Without gated agc, a large jamming signal would cause the automatic gain control to follow the
interfering signal. This would decrease the target return signal amplitude to an unusable value. Gated agc
produces an output signal for only short time periods; therefore, the agc output voltage must be averaged
over several cycles to keep the automatic gain control from becoming unstable.
</p><p class="paragraph">Gated agc does not respond to signals that arrive at times other than during the time of a target return
signal. However, it cannot prevent interference that occurs during the gating period. Neither can gating
the agc prevent the receiver from overloading because of jamming signal amplitudes far in excess of the
target return signal. This is because the desired target is gated to set the receiver gain for a signal of that
particular amplitude. As an aid in preventing radar receiver circuits from overloading during the reception
of jamming signals, fast-time-constant coupling circuits are used. These circuits connect the video
detector output to the video amplifier input circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">A fast-time-constant (ftc) circuit is a differentiator circuit located at the input of the first video
amplifier. When a large block of video is applied to the ftc circuit, only the leading edge will pass. This is
because of the short time constant of the differentiator. A small target will produce the same length of
signal on the indicator as a large target because only the leading edge is displayed. The ftc circuit has no
effect on receiver gain; and, although it does not eliminate jamming signals, ftc greatly reduces the effect
of jamming.

SPECIAL RECEIVERS
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic receiver of a radar system often does not meet all the requirements of the radar system, nor
does it always function very well in unfavorable environments. Several special receivers have been
developed to enhance target detection in unfavorable environments or to meet the requirements of special
transmission or scanning methods. A radar system with a moving target indicator (mti) system or a
monopulse scanning system requires a special type of receiver. Other types of special receivers, such as
the logarithmic receiver, have been developed to enhance reception during unfavorable conditions. These
receivers will be discussed in general terms in this section.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Moving Target Indicator (mti) System
The MOVING TARGET INDICATOR (mti) system effectively cancels CLUTTER (caused by fixed
</h3><p class="paragraph">unwanted echoes) and displays only moving target signals. Clutter is the appearance on a radar indicator
of confusing, unwanted echoes which interfere with the clear display of desired echoes. Clutter is the
result of echoes from land, water, weather, and so forth. The unwanted echoes can consist of GROUND
CLUTTER (echoes from surrounding land masses), SEA CLUTTER (echoes from the irregular surface of
the sea), or echoes from the clouds and rain. The problem is to find the desired echo in the midst of the
clutter. To do this, the mti system must be able to distinguish between fixed and moving targets and then
must eliminate only the fixed targets. This is accomplished by phase detection and pulse-to-pulse
comparison.
</p><p class="paragraph">Target echo signals from stationary objects have the same phase relationship from one receiving
period to the next. Moving objects produce echo signals that have a different phase relationship from one
receiving period to the next. This principle allows the mti system to discriminate between fixed and
moving targets.
</p><p class="paragraph">Signals received from each transmitted pulse are delayed for a period of time exactly equal to the
pulse-repetition time. The delayed signals are then combined with the signals received from the next
transmitted pulse. This is accomplished in such a manner that the amplitudes subtract from each other as
shown in figure 2-30, views Aand B. Since the fixed targets have approximately the same amplitude on
each successive pulse, they will be eliminated. The moving target signals, however, are of different
amplitudes on each successive pulse and, therefore, do not cancel. The resulting signal is then amplified
and presented on the indicators.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

pulse is originated by the transmitted pulse. It is used to synchronize the coho to a fixed phase

</p><p class="paragraph">The phase detector produces a video signal. The amplitude of the video signal is determined by the
phase difference between the coho reference signal and the IF echo signals. This phase difference is the
same as that between the actual transmitted pulse and its echo. The resultant video signal may be either
positive or negative. This video output, called coherent video, is applied to the 14-megahertz cw carrier
oscillator.
</p><p class="paragraph">The 14-megahertz cw carrier frequency is amplitude modulated by the phase-detected coherent
video. The modulated signal is amplified and applied to two channels. One channel delays the
14-megahertz signal for a period equal to the time between transmitted pulses. The signal is then amplified
and detected. The delay required (the period between transmitted pulses) is obtained by using a mercury
delay line or a fused-quartz delay line, which operates ultrasonically at 14 megahertz.
</p><p class="paragraph">The signal to the other channel is amplified and detected with no delay introduced. This channel
includes an attenuating network that introduces the same amount of attenuation as does the delay line in
the delayed video channel. The resulting nondelayed video signal is combined in opposite polarity with
the delayed signal. The amplitude difference, if any, at the comparison point between the two video
signals is amplified; because the signal is bipolar, it is made unipolar. The resultant video signal, which
represents only moving targets, is sent to the indicator system for display.
</p><p class="paragraph">An analysis of the mti system operation just described shows that signals from fixed targets produce
in the phase detector recurring video signals of the same amplitude and polarity. (Fixed targets have an
unchanging phase relationship to their respective transmitted pulses.) Thus, when one video pulse is</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">combined with the preceding pulse of opposite polarity, the video signals cancel and are not passed on to
the indicator system.
</p><p class="paragraph">Signals from moving targets, however, will have a varying phase relationship with the transmitted
pulse. As a result, the signals from successive receiving periods produce signals of different amplitudes in
the phase detector. When such signals are combined, the difference in signal amplitude provides a video
signal that is sent to the indicator system for display.
</p><p class="paragraph">The timing circuits, shown in figure 2-31, are used to accurately control the transmitter pulse-
repetition frequency to ensure that the pulse-repetition time remains constant from pulse to pulse. This is
necessary, of course, for the pulses arriving at the comparison point to coincide in time and achieve
cancellation of fixed targets.
</p><p class="paragraph">As shown in figure 2-31, a feedback loop is used from the output of the delay channel, through the
pickoff amplifier, to the trigger generator and gating multivibrator circuits. The leading edge of the square
wave produced by the detected carrier wave in the delayed video channel is differentiated at the pickoff
amplifier. It is used to activate the trigger generator and gating multivibrator. The trigger generator sends
an amplified trigger pulse to the modulator, causing the radar set to transmit.
</p><p class="paragraph">The gating multivibrator is also triggered by the negative spike from the differentiated square wave.
This stage applies a 2,000-microsecond negative gate to the 14-megahertz oscillator. The oscillator
operates for 2,400 microseconds and is then cut off. Because the delay line time is 2,500 microseconds,
the 14-megahertz oscillations stop before the initial waves reach the end of the delay line. This wave
train, when detected and differentiated, turns the gating multivibrator on, producing another 2,400-
microsecond wave train. The 100 microseconds of the delay line is necessary to ensure that the
mechanical waves within the line have time to damp out before the next pulse-repetition time. In this
manner the pulse-repetition time of the radar set is controlled by the delay of the mercury, or quartz delay
line. Because this delay line is also common to the video pulses going to the comparison point, the
delayed and the undelayed video pulses will arrive at exactly the same time.

Logarithmic Receiver
</p><p class="paragraph">The LOGARITHMIC RECEIVER uses a linear logarithmic amplifier, commonly called a LIN-LOG
AMPLIFIER, instead of a normal IF amplifier. The lin-log amplifier is a nonsaturating amplifier that does
not ordinarily use any special gain-control circuits. The output voltage of the lin-log amplifier is a linear
function of the input voltage for low-amplitude signals. It is a logarithmic function for high-amplitude
signals. In other words, the range of linear amplification does not end at a definite saturation point, as is
the case in normal IF amplifiers. The comparison of the response curves for normal IF and lin-log
amplifiers is shown in figure 2-32. The curves show that a continued increase in the input to the lin-log
amplifier causes a continued increase in the output, but at a reduced rate. Therefore, a large signal does
not saturate the lin-log amplifier; rather, it merely reduces the amplification of a simultaneously applied
small signal. A small echo signal can often be detected by the lin-log receiver when a normal receiver
would be saturated.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A typical circuit for obtaining a lin-log response is shown in figure 2-33. If detectors 2 and 3 were
not present, the output voltage would be limited by the saturation point of the final IF stage, as it is in a
normal IF section. However, when the final stage of the lin-log is saturated, larger signals cause an
increase in the output of the next to last stage. This increase is detected by detector 2 and summed with
the output of detector 1. This sum produces an increase in the output even though the final stage is
saturated. Detector 3 causes the output to continue to increase after the second stage saturates. The overall
gain becomes less and less as each stage saturates, but some degree of amplification is still available. The
proper choice of IF stage gains and saturation points produces an approximately logarithmic response
curve.

</h3><p class="paragraph">The most common of the automatic tracking radars is the MONOPULSE RADAR. The monopulse
radar obtains the three target position coordinates of range, bearing, and elevation from a single pulse.
The receiver for a monopulse radar must have three separate channels to process range, bearing, and
elevation information. The block diagram of a simplified monopulse receiver is shown in figure 2-35.
</p><p class="paragraph">As in a conventional receiver, each channel of the monopulse receiver converts the return echo to an
IF frequency by mixing the returned signal with a common local oscillator signal. The sum of the energy
from all four return signals is mixed with the local oscillator signal to produce range IF information.
Bearing information is obtained by subtracting the energy from horns B and D from the energy from
horns A and C:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">(A + C) - (B + D)
and mixing the difference with the local oscillator signal. The result is a bearing IF signal. Elevation
</p><p class="paragraph">information is obtained in the same way, except the energy from horns C and D is subtracted from the
energy from horns A and  B:
</p><h3 class="subsection">(A + B) - (C + D)
If the target is on the elevation and bearing axis, the summations will both be zero; therefore, neither
</h3><p class="paragraph">the bearing nor elevation channels will receive an input signal. If either of the bearing or elevation signals
is off the axis, an input to the IF channel is produced. This input is subsequently converted to an IF signal
in the appropriate channel.
</p><p class="paragraph">The major difference between the monopulse receiver and the conventional receiver is the
requirement for a dc error voltage output from the bearing and elevation channels. The range channel of a
monopulse receiver is sent to a conventional ranging circuit for presentation are on an indicator or for use
by a range-tracking circuit. However, since most monopulse radars are automatic tracking radars, the
outputs of the bearing and elevation channels must be converted to dc error signals for use by automatic
bearing and elevation tracking systems. The dc error voltages are applied to the antenna bearing and
elevation positioning servos. These servos reposition the antenna until the errors are nulled.
</p><p class="paragraph">The phase detectors compare the phase of the bearing and elevation IF with a reference IF from the
range channels. This comparison  produces the dc error pulses needed to drive the antenna servos. The
signals from both the bearing and elevation channels are the result of a summation process. They can be
either positive (in-phase) or negative (180-degrees out of phase) when compared to the reference IF
signal. For example, if the output of horns A and C is smaller than the output of horns B and D, a negative
or 180-degree-out-of-phase signal is produced by the bearing channel (A + C) - (B + D). If output A + C
is greater than output B + D, a positive or in-phase signal is produced by the bearing channel. The phase
of the bearing and elevation output signals determines the direction in which the antenna moves; the
magnitude of the signal determines the amount of movement. Since two signals must be present at the
phase detector to produce an output, an error signal occurs only when a return echo is not on the antenna
beam axis.
</p><p class="paragraph">This technique produces an error signal when the target moves off the radiated beam axis in either
bearing or elevation. The error signal causes the antenna to move in the proper direction and for the
proper duration to cancel the error signal. This method of automatic tracking is commonly used by
weapons-control tracking radar systems.

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY
</h1><p class="paragraph">The following paragraphs summarize the important points of this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">The SYNCHRONIZER is essential to any radar because it controls and times the operation of the
entire system. Radar systems may be self-synchronized by triggers from the transmitter or externally
synchronized from a master oscillator.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most modern systems are synchronized by a MASTER OSCILLATOR, which may be a
SINEWAVE OSCILLATOR, an ASTABLE MULTIVIBRATOR, or a BLOCKING OSCILLATOR.
</p><p class="paragraph">Each of these oscillators fulfills the basic requirements of a synchronizer, which must be:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• free running
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• stable in frequency
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• frequency variable (in steps)
The TRANSMITTER produces the short-duration, high-power, rf pulses of energy that are radiated
</h3><p class="paragraph">into space by the antenna.
</p><p class="paragraph">The MODULATOR controls the radar pulse, width and amplitude.
</p><p class="paragraph">KEYED-OSCILLATOR TRANSMITTERS produce a high-power output pulse by keying a high-
power oscillator, such as a MAGNETRON.
</p><p class="paragraph">POWER-AMPLIFIER TRANSMITTERS amplify a low-level pulse to the desired power level
using a series of microwave amplifiers such as TRAVELING-WAVE TUBES or KLYSTRONS.
</p><p class="paragraph">The DUPLEXER is a device that allows the same antenna to both transmit and receive. Most
duplexers use the impedance characteristics of transmission lines and waveguides in conjunction with TR
and ATR tubes to route the energy to the correct place. One of the most important functions of the
duplexer is isolation of the receiver during transmission.
</p><p class="paragraph">The RECEIVER detects the very small target return echo and amplifies it to a usable level for
display on the indicator.
</p><p class="paragraph">A typical SUPERHETERODYNE RECEIVER consists of a low-noise amplifier, a mixer, a local
oscillator, an IF amplifier, a detector, and a video amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some special purpose receivers are the MOVING TARGET INDICATOR and MONOPULSE
RECEIVERS.

</h2><h3 class="subsection">Radar systems require an antenna to both transmit and receive radar energy and an indicator system 
</h3><p class="paragraph">to display the video information generated. This chapter will briefly describe some commonly used 
</p><p class="paragraph">indicators and antenna systems. Antenna systems are described in more detail in NEETS, Module 10, 
</p><p class="paragraph">Introduction to Wave Generation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas, and Module 11, Microwave

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADAR-INDICATORS-3-1-">RADAR INDICATORS 
</h2><h3 class="subsection">The information available from a radar receiver may contain as many as several million separate data 
</h3><p class="paragraph">bits per second. From these and other data, such as the orientation of the antenna, the indicator should 
</p><h3 class="subsection">present to the observer a continuous, easily understandable, graphic picture of the relative position of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">radar targets. It should provide size, shape, and insofar as possible, indications of the type of targets. A 
</p><p class="paragraph">cathode-ray tube (crt) fulfills these requirements to an astonishing degree. The cathode-ray tube's 
</p><p class="paragraph">principal shortcoming is that it cannot present a true three-dimensional picture. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The fundamental geometrical quantities involved in radar displays are the RANGE, AZIMUTH 
</h3><p class="paragraph">ANGLE (or BEARING), and ELEVATION ANGLE. These displays relate the position of a radar target </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">to the origin at the antenna. Most radar displays include one or two of these quantities as coordinates of 
</p><p class="paragraph">the crt face. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The actual range of a target from the radar, whether on the ground, in the water, or in the air is 
</h3><p class="paragraph">known as SLANT RANGE. The majority of displays use as one coordinate the value of slant range, its 
</p><p class="paragraph">horizontal projection (GROUND RANGE), or its vertical projection (ALTITUDE). Since slant range is 
</p><p class="paragraph">involved in every radar situation, it inevitably appears in at least one display on every set. Slant range is 
</p><p class="paragraph">the coordinate that is duplicated most often when more than one type of display is used. This is partly 
</p><h3 class="subsection">because displays presenting range have the highest signal-to-noise discrimination and partly for 
</h3><p class="paragraph">geometrical reasons. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Range is displayed by means of a linear time-base sweep, starting from a given point or line at a 
</h3><p class="paragraph">definite time in each pulse cycle. Thus, distances along this range sweep actually measure slant range. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The sweep speed determines the scale factor, which relates the distance on the tube to actual range. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">sweep length is the total distance represented. Distances are expressed in miles (statute or nautical) or 
</p><p class="paragraph">yards. The origin of the range sweep may be on or off the tube face. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The angle at which the antenna is pointing, either in azimuth or elevation, may provide two-
</h3><p class="paragraph">dimensional information in the display; that is, range and azimuth, or range and elevation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A radar indicator, sometimes called a radar repeater, acts as the master timing device in analyzing 
the return of the video in a radar system. It also provides that capability to various other locations 
</p><p class="paragraph">physically remote from the radar system. Each indicator should have the ability to select the outputs from 
</p><p class="paragraph">any desired radar system aboard the ship. This is usually accomplished by the use of a RADAR 
</p><p class="paragraph">DISTRIBUTION SWITCHBOARD. The switchboard contains a switching arrangement that has inputs 
</p><p class="paragraph">from each radar system aboard ship and provides outputs to each repeater. The radar desired is selected by 
</p><p class="paragraph">means of a selector switch on the repeater. For the repeater to present correct target position data, the 
</p><p class="paragraph">indicator must have the following three inputs from the selected radar: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Trigger timing pulses. These pulses ensure that the sweep on the repeater starts from its point of 
origin each time the radar transmits. As discussed earlier, the repeater displays all targets at their 
</p><h3 class="subsection">actual range from the ship based on the time lapse between the instant of transmission and the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">instant the target's echo is received. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The returning echo. The echo, in rf form, is detected (converted to a video signal) by the radar 
receiver and applied to the repeater. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Antenna information. The angular sweep position of a plan position indicator (ppi) repeater must 
be synchronized to the angular position of the radar antenna to display target bearing (azimuth) 
</p><p class="paragraph">information. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The three most common types of displays, called scopes, are the A-scope, the RANGE-HEIGHT 
</h3><p class="paragraph">INDICATOR (RHI) SCOPE, and the PLAN POSITION INDICATOR (PPI) SCOPE. The primary 
</p><p class="paragraph">function of these displays will be discussed in this section. However, detailed descriptions will be limited 
</p><p class="paragraph">to the ppi scope, which is the most common display. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-A-SCOPE-3-2-">THE A SCOPE 
</h2><h3 class="subsection">The A-scope display, shown in figure 3-1, presents only the range to the target and the relative 
</h3><p class="paragraph">strength of the echo. Such a display is normally used in weapons control radar systems. The bearing and 
</p><h3 class="subsection">elevation angles are presented as dial or digital readouts that correspond to the actual physical position of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the antenna. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">brightens the trace or brackets the blip (depending on the system) to indicate what target is being tracked. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Range-gate generators are used most often in weapons-control track radar A-scope presentations, but they 
</h3><p class="paragraph">can also be used with ppi presentations. When used with a ppi presentation, the range gate must be 
</p><p class="paragraph">movable in both range and bearing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The range-gate generator can easily be modified to produce a range strobe instead of a range gate. A 
</p><p class="paragraph">range strobe is simply a single brightened spot that is movable both in range and bearing. In operation, the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">range strobe or range gate control also controls a dial or digital readout to provide a range readout to the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">operator. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Range-Marker Generator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Several types of range-marker generators are in common use. Figure 3-12 shows a simplified version 
</p><p class="paragraph">of a circuit that produces both range markers and the basic system timing triggers. The master oscillator in 
</p><p class="paragraph">this case is a blocking oscillator that operates at a frequency of 80.86 kilohertz. By dividing 80.86 
</p><p class="paragraph">kilohertz into 1 (t = 1/frequency), we find the time required for one cycle of operation is 12.36 
</p><p class="paragraph">microseconds. Thus the blocking oscillator produces pulses 1 radar mile apart. These are fed to the 5:1 
</p><p class="paragraph">divider circuit. Five of the 1-mile marks are required to produce an output from the divider circuit. These 
</p><p class="paragraph">five-mile marks are sent to the indicator for display and to the 10:1 divider circuit. In the latter case, ten of 
</p><p class="paragraph">the five-mile marks are required to produce an output from the 10:1 divider. Thus the output triggers are 
</p><p class="paragraph">50 miles apart. These basic timing triggers are for a radar with a range of fifty miles. The period between 
</p><p class="paragraph">triggers could be extended through the use of additional dividers for use with longer range systems. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another version of a range-mark generator is shown in figure 3-13. This circuit provides range 
</p><p class="paragraph">marks at 1,000-, 2,000-, or 3,000-yard intervals. Generation of the marks begins with the ringing 
</p><p class="paragraph">oscillator, which is started by a delayed master trigger from the synchronizer. A ringing oscillator 
</p><p class="paragraph">produces a sinusoidal output of a fixed duration and frequency when triggered. The output is 
</p><p class="paragraph">synchronized to the input trigger. In this circuit, the trigger causes the oscillator to produce a 162-
</p><p class="paragraph">kilohertz signal that lasts for 4 1/2 cycles. The emitter follower isolates the ringing oscillator from the 
</p><p class="paragraph">countdown multivibrator and clips the oscillator output signals. This action allows only the positive half 
</p><p class="paragraph">of each sine wave to reach the multivibrator. The positive triggers from the ringing oscillator are at 1,000-
</p><p class="paragraph">yard intervals. This input signal results in an output from the countdown multivibrator of 1,000-, 2,000-, 
</p><p class="paragraph">or 3,000-yard range marks, depending on the position of the RANGE MARK SELECT SWITCH. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADAR-ANTENNAS-3-16-">RADAR ANTENNAS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In this section, we will briefly review the requirements of radar antennas. Antenna characteristics are 
</p><p class="paragraph">discussed in detail in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave-Generation, Transmission Lines, and 
Antenna and in Module 11, Microwave Principles. A review of these modules would be helpful at this 
point to prepare you for the following radar antenna discussion. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Antennas fall into two general classes, OMNIDIRECTIONAL and DIRECTIONAL. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Omnidirectional antennas radiate rf energy in all directions simultaneously. They are seldom used with 
</p><h3 class="subsection">modern radars, but are commonly used in radio equipment, in iff (identification friend or foe) equipment, 
</h3><p class="paragraph">and in countermeasures receivers for the detection of enemy radar signals. Directional antennas radiate rf 
</p><h3 class="subsection">energy in patterns of LOBES or BEAMS that extend outward from the antenna in one direction for a 
</h3><p class="paragraph">given antenna position. The radiation pattern also contains minor lobes, but these lobes are weak and 
</p><p class="paragraph">normally have little effect on the main radiation pattern. The main lobe may vary in angular width from 
</p><p class="paragraph">one or two degrees in some radars to 15 to 20 degrees in other radars. The width depends on the system's 
</p><p class="paragraph">purpose and the degree of accuracy required. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Directional antennas have two important characteristics, DIRECTIVITY and POWER GAIN. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">directivity of an antenna refers to the degree of sharpness of its beam. If the beam is narrow in either the 
</p><p class="paragraph">horizontal or vertical plane, the antenna is said to have high directivity in that plane. Conversely, if the 
</p><p class="paragraph">beam is broad in either plane, the directivity of the antenna in that plane is low. Thus, if an antenna has a 
</p><h3 class="subsection">narrow horizontal beam and a wide vertical beam, the horizontal directivity is high and the vertical 
</h3><p class="paragraph">directivity is low. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">When the directivity of an antenna is increased, that is, when the beam is narrowed, less power is 
</h3><p class="paragraph">required to cover the same range because the power is concentrated. Thus, the other characteristic of an 
</p><p class="paragraph">antenna, power gain, is introduced. This characteristic is directly related to directivity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Power gain of an antenna is the ratio of its radiated power to that of a reference (basic) dipole. Both 
</p><h3 class="subsection">antennas must have been excited or fed in the same manner and each must have radiated from the same 
</h3><p class="paragraph">position. A single point of measurement for the power-gain ratio must lie within the radiation field of 
</p><p class="paragraph">each antenna. An antenna with high directivity has a high power gain, and vice versa. The power gain of a 
</p><p class="paragraph">single dipole with no reflector is unity. An array of several dipoles in the same position as the single 
</p><h3 class="subsection">dipole and fed from the same line would have a power gain of more than one; the exact figure would 
</h3><p class="paragraph">depend on the directivity of the array. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The measurement of the bearing of a target, as detected by the radar, is usually given as an angular 
</h3><p class="paragraph">position. The angle may be measured either from true north (true bearing), or with respect to the bow of a 
</p><p class="paragraph">ship or nose of an aircraft containing the radar set (relative bearing). The angle at which the echo signal 
</p><p class="paragraph">returns is measured by using the directional characteristics of the radar antenna system. Radar antennas 
</p><h3 class="subsection">consist of radiating elements, reflectors, and directors to produce a narrow, unidirectional beam of rf 
</h3><p class="paragraph">energy. A pattern produced in this manner permits the beaming of maximum energy in a desired 
</p><p class="paragraph">direction. The transmitting pattern of an antenna system is also its receiving pattern. An antenna can 
</p><p class="paragraph">therefore be used to transmit energy, receive energy, or both. The simplest form of antenna for measuring 
</p><p class="paragraph">azimuth (bearing) is a rotating antenna that produces a single-lobe pattern. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The remaining coordinate necessary to locate a target in space may be expressed either as elevation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">angle or as altitude. If one is known, the other can be calculated from basic trigonometric functions. A 
</p><p class="paragraph">method of determining the angle of elevation or the altitude is shown in figure 3-16. The slant range is 
</p><p class="paragraph">obtained from the radar scope as the distance to the target. The angle of elevation is the angle between the 
</p><p class="paragraph">axis of the radar beam and the earth's surface. The altitude in feet is equal to the slant range in feet 
</p><p class="paragraph">multiplied by the sine of the angle of elevation. For example if the slant range in figure 3-16 is 2,000 feet </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The effectiveness of your radar system depends largely upon the care and attention you give it. An 
improperly adjusted transmitter, for example, can reduce the accuracy of a perfectly aligned receiver; the 
entire system then becomes essentially useless. Maintenance, therefore, must encompass the entire system 
for best operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of the complexity of most radar systems, trying to detail step-by-step procedures for specific 
maintenance actions in this chapter is impractical. However, the basic procedures for some maintenance 
actions that are common to most radar systems will be discussed. Also, an overview of support systems 
for radars will be presented. This will include electrical power, dry-air systems, and liquid cooling 
systems. Finally, safety precautions inherent to radars are listed.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TRANSMITTER-PERFORMANCE-CHECKS-4-1-">TRANSMITTER PERFORMANCE CHECKS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The transmitter of a radar is designed to operate within a limited band of frequencies at an optimum 
power level. Operation at frequencies or power levels outside the assigned band greatly decreases the 
efficiency of the transmitter and may cause interference with other radars. Therefore, transmitter 
performance must be monitored closely for both frequency and output power. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TRANSMITTER-FREQUENCY-4-2-">TRANSMITTER FREQUENCY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Whether of the fixed-frequency or tunable type, the radar transmitter frequency should be checked 
periodically. If the transmitter is of the fixed-frequency type and found to be operating outside its normal 
operating band, the problem is probably a defective part. The defective component must be replaced. If 
the transmitter is tunable, the transmitter must again be tuned to the assigned frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each time a radar transmitter generates an rf pulse, it produces electromagnetic energy. You should 
recall from your study of NEETS, Module 12, Modulation Principles, that the square wave used to 
modulate the transmitter carrier wave has (1) the fundamental square-wave frequency and (2) an infinite 
number of odd harmonics of the fundamental square wave frequency. When this square wave is used to 
modulate the transmitter carrier frequency, both the fundamental and odd harmonic frequencies of the 
square wave heterodyne with the transmitter carrier frequency. The heterodyning process produces in 
each transmitted rf pulse the following frequencies: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. The fundamental carrier frequency 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The sum and difference frequencies between the carrier and fundamental square-wave 
frequencies 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. The sum and difference frequencies between the odd harmonics of the square wave and the 
carrier frequencies 
</p><p class="paragraph">For a complete discussion of this process, you should review module 12. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Actually, the radar energy is distributed more or less symmetrically over a band of frequencies. This 
frequency distribution of energy is known as the FREQUENCY SPECTRUM. An analysis of frequency 
spectrum characteristics may be made with a SPECTRUM ANALYZER. The spectrum analyzer presents 
a graphic display of energy versus frequency. An extensive explanation of spectrum analyzer use can be 
found in the Electronics Installation and Maintenance Book (EIMB), Test Methods and Practices, 
NAVSEA 0967-LP-000-0130. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Spectrum Analysis 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When properly performed and interpreted, a spectrum analysis will reveal misadjustments and 
troubles that would otherwise be difficult to locate. Therefore, you should be able to perform a spectrum 
analysis and understand the results. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You may be wondering why we are so interested in the frequency spectrum of an rf pulse. To better 
understand why, look at the spectrum of a transmitter as compared to the response curve of a receiver in 
figure 4-1. The receiver's response curve has a broader bandwidth than the transmitted spectrum, which 
ensures complete coverage. But the receiver responds best to frequencies in the middle of the bandwidth. 
This causes the receiver response to taper off from both sides of the center frequency until the response 
passes through the half-power points, as shown on the curve. Usually the receiver response beyond these 
points is too low to be useful and is not considered. Notice that the spectrum of the transmitter is centered 
inside the response curve of the receiver, thus yielding maximum efficiency. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Any frequency, when modulated by another frequency, will produce a base frequency with sideband 
frequencies (sum and difference). In other words, the output of a pulsed radar will contain more than one 
frequency. The output frequency spectrum of the pulsed radar transmitter does not consist of just a single 
frequency that is turned on and off at the pulse-repetition frequency (prf). Consider the spectrum as a base 
frequency (carrier) that is modulated by short rectangular pulses occurring at the prf of the radar. Two 
distinct modulating components are present: One component consists of the prf and its associated 
harmonics; the other component consists of the fundamental and odd-harmonic frequencies that make up 
the rectangular modulating pulse. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The distribution of power over the radar frequency spectrum depends on the amount of modulation. 
A pulsed radar spectrum is illustrated in figure 4-2. The vertical lines represent the modulation 
frequencies produced by the prf and its associated harmonics; the lobes represent the modulation 
frequencies produced by the fundamental pulse frequency and its associated harmonics. The amplitude of 
the main lobe falls to zero on each side of the carrier. The side lobes are produced by the odd harmonics 
of the fundamental pulse frequency. The zero points are produced by the even harmonics of the 
fundamental pulse frequency. In an ideal spectrum each frequency above the carrier has its counterpart in 
another frequency below the carrier. These frequencies are equally spaced and have equal power. 
Therefore, the pattern is symmetrical about the carrier. The main lobe, of course, contains the major 
portion of the transmitted rf energy.

</p><p class="paragraph">A radar transmitter in good condition should produce a spectrum curve similar to the curves shown 
in view A or B in figure 4-3. Good curves are those in which the two halves are symmetrical and contain 
deep, well-defined minimum points (minima) on both sides of the main peak. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A curve without well-defined minima, as in the curve shown in view C, indicates that the transmitter 
output is being frequency modulated during the pulse. This condition may occur when a pulse without 
sufficiently steep sides or a flat peak is applied to the transmitter. It may also occur when a transmitter 
tube is unstable or is operated without proper voltage, current, or magnetic field. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An extremely irregular spectrum, as in the curve in view D, is an indication of severe frequency 
modulation. This condition usually causes trouble with the receiver automatic frequency control (afc) as 
well as a general loss of signal strength. You can often improve a faulty spectrum by adjusting the 
transmission line stubs or by replacing the transmitter tube. When the spectrum has two large peaks that 
are quite far apart, it indicates that the transmitter tube is DOUBLE MODING (shifting from one 
frequency to another). This could be caused by standing waves in the transmission line or a faulty 
transmitter tube. Standing waves may be caused by a faulty line connection, a bad antenna rotating joint, 
or obstructions in the line. (Standing waves are described in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave 
Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas.) </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

be included in a special RADAR TEST SET designed for a specific system or type of radar. Radar test 
sets quite often consist of several types of test equipment. This combination of test equipments enables 
both transmitter and receiver performance checks to be carried out with one test instrument. Electronic 
frequency counters, frequency meters, and wavemeters are discussed in NEETS, Module 16, Introduction 
to Test Equipment. The echo box is discussed in the next section. The specific equipments and procedures 
required to measure the frequency of any radar system are found in the associated system technical 
manuals and related PMS documents.

</p><h3 class="subsection">The Echo Box 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ECHO BOX is an important test instrument for indicating the overall radar system performance. 
The echo-box test results reflect the combined relative effectiveness of the transmitter as a transmitter of 
energy and the receiver as a receiver of energy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The echo box, or RESONANCE CHAMBER, basically consists of a resonant cavity, as shown in 
view A of figure 4-4. You adjust the resonant frequency of the cavity by varying the size of the cavity 
(the larger the cavity the lower the frequency). A calibrated tuning mechanism controls the position of a 
plunger and, therefore, the size of the cavity. The tuning mechanism is adjusted for maximum meter 
deflection, which indicates that the echo box is tuned to the precise transmitted frequency. The tuning 
mechanism also indicates on a dial (figure 4-5, view A) both the coarse transmitted frequency and a 
numerical reading. This reading permits the technician to determine the transmitted frequency with 
greater accuracy by referring to a calibration curve on a chart (figure 4-5, view B). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Energy is coupled out of the cavity to the rectifier and meter by means of the output loop. You can vary 
the amount of coupling between the echo box and the crystal rectifier by changing the position of the 
output loop. A schematic diagram of the output circuit is shown in figure 4-4, view B. The energy picked 
up by the loop is rectified, filtered, and applied to the meter. The method of connecting the echo box in a 
radar system is shown in figure 4-4, view C. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RING-TIME-MEASUREMENTS-4-7-">RING TIME MEASUREMENTS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Some of the energy generated by the radar transmitter is picked up by the echo box by means of the 
directional coupler. This energy causes oscillations (known as RINGING) within the echo box that persist 
for some time after the end of the radar pulse, much in the fashion of an echo that persists in a large room 
after a loud noise. As this echo dies down, a part of it is fed back into the radar receiving system, again by 
means of the directional coupler. The ringing causes a saturating signal to appear on the radar indicator 
(figure 4-6). The longer this ringing extends, the better the performance of the radar. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The length of time the echo box should ring under the particular conditions of the test is called the 
EXPECTED RING TIME. You may determine whether or not the radar is performing well by comparing 
the expected ring time with the ring time observed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ring time to be expected on a good radar depends on the particular type of radar being tested; on 
the way the echo box is installed - that is, whether a directional coupler or a pickup dipole is used; on the 
length and type of cable used; on the individual ringing ability of the particular echo box in use; on the 
frequency of the radar; and on the temperature of the echo box at the time of the test. Corrections are 
made for all of these factors according to the procedure given in the technical manual for the echo box 
being used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You may use an echo box without correction to detect a change in the performance of a radar. You 
simply log and compare the ring time from day to day. You should recognize that these readings do not </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

readings to tell whether or not its performance is deteriorating. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because ring time measurements are the most valuable single feature of the echo box, they must be 
measured properly. Ring time measurements are made on the A-scope or on the ppi. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In measuring the ring time, you should make sure the echo-box ringing (not some fixed-target echo 
or block of echoes) is being monitored. You can determine this condition by adjusting the radar gain 
control and noting if the ring time varies on the scope. The echo box ringing will change in duration; 
fixed target echoes, however, will not change duration. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To obtain the best results, you should repeat every ring time measurement at least four times; then 
average the readings. You should take special care to ensure that all readings are accurate. If two or more 
technicians use the same echo box, they should practice together until their ring time measurements agree. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TRANSMITTER-POWER-MEASUREMENT-4-8-">TRANSMITTER POWER MEASUREMENT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Because high peak power and radio frequencies are produced by radar transmitters, special 
procedures are used to measure output power. High peak power is needed in some radar transmitters to 
produce strong echos at long ranges. Low average power is also desirable because it enables transmitter 
components to be compact, more reliable, and to remain cooler during operation. Because of these 
considerations, the lowest possible duty cycle (pw x prf) must be used for best operation. The 
relationships of peak power, average power, and duty cycle were described in chapter 1. Peak power in a 
radar is primarily a design consideration. It depends on the interrelationships between average power, 
pulse width, and pulse-repetition time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You take power measurements from a radar transmitter by sampling the output power. In one 
sampling method, you use a pickup horn in front of the antenna. Air losses and weather conditions make 
the horn placement extremely critical and also affect the accuracy of the sample. A more accurate and 
convenient method can be used. In this method, you sample the output power through a directional 
sampling coupler located at the point in the transmitter where a power reading is desired. Power-amplifier 
transmitters usually have sampling couplers after each stage of amplification. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Some radar sets have built-in power-measuring equipment; others require the use of general purpose 
test equipment or a special test set. In any case, the measuring instruments are most often referenced to 1 
milliwatt; readings are taken in dBm (a discussion of the decibel measurement system was presented in 
NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles). 
</p><p class="paragraph">When taking power measurements, you must allow for power losses. You must add the directional 
coupler attenuation factor and the loss in the connecting cable to the power meter reading. The sum is the 
total power reading. For example, the directional coupler has an attenuation factor of 20 dB, the 
connecting cable has a loss rating of 8 dB, and the reading obtained on the power meter is 21 dBm. 
Therefore, the transmitter has an output power that is 49 dBm (21 + 20 + 8). Power readings in dBm 
obtained by the above procedure are normally converted to watts to provide useful information. Although 
the conversion can be accomplished mathematically, the procedure is relatively complex and is seldom 
necessary. Most radar systems have a conversion chart, such as the one shown in figure 4-7, attached to 
the transmitter or the test equipment. As you can see on the chart, 49 dBm is easily converted to 80 watts 
average power. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

determination and minimum discernible signal (mds) measurement; (2) tr recovery time; and (3) receiver 
bandwidth. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Many radar systems contain circuits that serve special functions. Three of these special circuits are 
instantaneous automatic gain control (iagc), sensitivity time control (stc), and fast time constant (ftc). 
These circuits may be found in combination or alone, depending on the purpose of the radar. When the 
test methods and procedures about to be described are used, these special functions should not be used. If 
an automatic frequency control (afc) circuit is included in the radar, it may be permitted to operate during 
receiver tests. A good way you can check afc circuit operation is to complete the tests specified for 
manual tuning and then switch to afc. If the afc circuit operation is normal, test indications should not 
differ. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RECEIVER-SENSITIVITY-4-10-">RECEIVER SENSITIVITY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Insufficient detection range in a radar system can be caused by decreased sensitivity in the radar 
receiver. This condition results mainly from the great number of adjustments and components associated 
with the receiver. A decrease of receiver sensitivity has the same effect on range performance as does a 
decrease of transmitter power. For example, a 6 dB loss of receiver sensitivity shortens the effective range 
of a radar just as much as a 6 dB loss in transmitter power. Such a drop in transmitter power is evident 
and is easy to detect. On the other hand, a 6 dB loss in receiver sensitivity, which can easily result from a 
slight misadjustment in the receiver, is difficult to detect unless accurate measurements are made. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-8 shows a comparison of radar system performance versus maximum range. The system 
performance loss in dB includes both transmitter and receiver losses. You should note that with a loss of 5 
dB in both receiver and transmitter (a total of 10 dB), only 55 percent of the maximum range of the 
system is realized. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The sensitivity of the radar receiver is a measure of its ability to pick up weak signals. The greater 
the sensitivity of the receiver, the better the receiver picks up weak signals. You can determine receiver 
sensitivity by measuring the power level of the MINIMUM DISCERNIBLE SIGNAL (mds). Mds is 
defined as the weakest signal that produces a visible receiver output (on a scope). Its value is determined 
by the receiver output noise level (noise tends to obscure weak signals). Because mds measurement 
depends on the receiver noise level, measuring either mds or noise level (called NOISE FIGURE) will 
indicate receiver sensitivity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Many radar systems have built-in receiver sensitivity test circuits. These test circuits indicate the 
sensitivity of the receiver to the technician or operator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To measure the mds, you must measure the power of a test pulse in which the level is just sufficient 
to produce a visible receiver output. If a radar receiver has the mds level specified in the maintenance 
manual, then the noise figure should also be correct. Therefore, measurement of the mds is a satisfactory 
substitute for a noise-figure determination and is less complicated. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because receiver sensitivity readings are taken periodically for comparison purposes, the identical 
pulse length must be used for each measurement. Maintenance instructions for the radar set usually 
specify the correct pulse length to be used in receiver sensitivity tests. In most cases, it is the same as the 
transmitter pulse length. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Before any measurements of receiver sensitivity can be made, the receiver must be accurately tuned 
to the transmitter frequency. If the receiver frequency differs from the transmitter frequency, the most 
likely cause is an improperly adjusted or malfunctioning local oscillator or transmitter frequency drift. 
Such problems can be caused by heat or aging components. Local oscillator tuning procedures differ 
widely according to the type of radar system; therefore, you should follow the tuning procedures in the 
system maintenance manuals. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Two basic methods are used to measure radar receiver sensitivity. One is the PULSE METHOD, in 
which a pulse of measured amplitude and width is coupled to the receiver. In the second method, you use 
an fm generator to vary the signal generator output frequency across the receiver bandwidth. This latter 
method ensures the test signal is within the bandpass of the receiver. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The sensitivity of the receiver is equal to the sum of the reading on the signal generator and the 
attenuations of the connecting cable and directional coupler. Receiver sensitivity is expressed as a 
negative dBm; for example, -90 dBm expresses the sensitivity of a receiver that can detect a signal 90 dB 
less than the 1-milliwatt reference level. A typical receiver sensitivity reading on a modern radar should 
be in the vicinity of -105 dBm. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RECEIVER-BANDWIDTH-TEST-4-12-">RECEIVER BANDWIDTH TEST 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Receiver bandwidth is defined as the frequency spread between the half-power points on the receiver 
response curve. Receiver bandwidth is specified for each radar, but wide variations are often tolerated. If 
either the bandwidth or the shape of the receiver response curve is not within tolerances, a detailed check 
of circuit components may be necessary. A considerable change in the value of circuit components is 
required to alter the response. You should check receiver response after any extensive repair to an IF 
amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-9 shows a typical response curve of a radar receiver. The half-power points are shown as 3 
dB below maximum response. Since the curve is plotted in terms of voltage, these points are also 
represented by the 70.7 percent voltage points as shown in the figure.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TR-RECOVERY-TIME-4-13-">TR RECOVERY TIME 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The time required for tr recovery is determined by the time taken by the tr switch (tube) to deionize 
after each transmitter pulse. It is usually defined as the time required for the receiver to return to within 6 
dB of normal sensitivity after the end of the transmitter pulse. However, some manufacturers use the time 
required for the sensitivity to return to within 3 dB of normal sensitivity. Tr recovery time is a factor that 
limits the minimum range of a radar because the radar receiver is unable to receive until the tr switch is 
deionized. In various radars, the recovery time may differ from less than 1 microsecond to about 20 
microseconds. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The primary function of the tr switch is to protect the sensitive crystal detectors from the powerful 
transmitter pulse. Even the best tr switches allow some power to leak through; but when the switch is 
functioning properly, leakage power is so small that it does not damage the crystal. However, the useful 
life of a tr tube is limited because the amount of leakage to the receiver increases with use. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To ensure efficient performance, some technicians make a policy of replacing the tr tube after a 
certain number of hours of use. A better practice is to measure the tr recovery time at frequent intervals 
and make a graph or chart. A graph or chart will immediately disclose any change in performance. Figure 
4-10 shows how the recovery time is correlated with leakage power. Note that the end of the useful life of 
the tr tube is indicated by an increase in recovery time. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">This method of checking the condition of a tr tube is reliable because recovery time increases before 
leakage power becomes excessive. In practice, a tr tube is replaced when any sharp increase in recovery 
time becomes apparent. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Ambient temperature also has an effect on recovery time. The colder a tr tube, the greater its 
recovery time. When tests are conducted under widely varying temperature conditions, this effect must be 
considered.

</h2><p class="paragraph">(You may want to refer to NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission 
Lines, and Antennas for a review of standing waves before going further.) Measurements of standing 
waves can indicate the approximate operating frequency, the presence of defective transmission-line 
sections, and the condition of the antenna. Standing waves present on transmission lines and waveguides 
indicate an impedance mismatch between a transmitter or receiver and its antenna. When this condition 
occurs, the transfer of energy between these units becomes inefficient. Reflection of energy at the load 
end of a transmission line results in a wave that travels toward the generator end. This reflected wave 
varies continuously in phase in much the same way that the incident wave varies in phase. At certain 
points, a half wavelength apart, the two waves are exactly in phase; the resultant voltage is at maximum. 
At points a quarter wavelength from the maximums, the two waves are in opposition and voltage nodes 
(null points) are produced. The ratio of maximum-to-minimum voltage at such points is called the 
VOLTAGE STANDING WAVE RATIO (vswr). The ratio of maximum-to-minimum current along a 
transmission line is the same as the vswr. A high vswr (1.5 to 1 or higher) indicates that the characteristic 
impedance of a transmission line differs greatly from the terminating impedance; a low vswr (1 to 1 is 
best) indicates a good impedance match between the transmission line characteristic impedance and the 
terminating impedance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For radar applications, a low vswr is desired for the following reasons: (1) Reflections in the 
transmission line cause improper transmitter operation and can result in faulty pulsing (this effect is most 
pronounced when the line is long, as compared with a wavelength of the transmitted energy); (2) arc-over 
may occur at the maximum voltage points; and (3) hot spots can occur in the transmission line and cause 
mechanical breakdown. Since transmission lines for radar equipment are normally coaxial cables or 
waveguides, slotted lines or directional couplers must be used for standing-wave measurements.

that are fed by both normal and alternate and/or emergency feeders (figure 4-11). Either the normal or 
alternate source of the ship's service power can be selected. Emergency power from the emergency 
distribution system can be used if an emergency feeder is also provided. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Automatic bus transfer (ABT) equipment is used to provide power to vital loads, while nonvital 
loads can be fed through manual bus transfer (MBT) equipment. For example, the interior 
communications (IC) switchboard is fed through an ABT in which the alternate input is from the 
emergency switchboard. A search radar might be fed through an MBT. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Miscellaneous Power 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Many other supply voltages are used in radar systems and subsystems. They are usually used as 
reference voltages for specific functions. When you are missing a power input to your equipment, work 
backwards from the load to the source. Usually, the power panels and bus transfer units that feed the 
equipment are located nearby, possibly in the same space or in a passageway. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Keep in mind that technicians have corrected many suspected casualties merely by restoring a minor 
power input or signal reference, sometimes after hours of troubleshooting.

dehydrators can operate independently of the ship's air supply. Some units of electronic equipment that 
have local dehydrator units are pressure interlocked within the dehydrator unit. When the outlet air 
pressure is below a set value, the interlock prevents the equipment from going to a full OPERATE 
condition. When the central dry-air system is used, the pressure interlock is bypassed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Some radars provide a tank of nitrogen as an emergency source that can be connected in place of dry

of transmitters (and other high-voltage circuits), individual components may require cooling. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Cabinets that generate relatively small amounts of heat may only require a system of fans or blowers 
to maintain constant air circulation. In some cases the air is circulated through a liquid-cooled heat 
exchanger located inside the cabinet. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most low-power amplifier tubes are air cooled; most high-power tubes, such as klystrons, crossed-
field amplifiers, and magnetrons, are liquid cooled. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The main source of power and heat in a power amplifier package is the high-voltage power supply. 
Part of the power produced by the power amplifier is transmitted in the form of rf energy; the remainder 
of the power eventually converts to heat, and cooling is required to dissipate the heat. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radars that use blowers for cooling will usually have an airflow sensing switch. If the blower fails, 
the switch will open and remove power from appropriate power supplies. Radars employing liquid 
cooling normally distribute the liquid into a large number of separate paths, because the flow 
requirements are quite dissimilar. Each of the various paths will have a low flow interlock. If one of the 
liquid cooling paths becomes restricted, the low flow interlock switch will open and remove power from 
the radar. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Liquid cooling systems also include pressure gauges and switches, temperature gauges, and 
overtemperature switches. Many systems have pressure or flow regulators. Some systems include audio 
and/or visual alarms that energize before damage actually occurs. In some cases this allows the problem 
to be corrected without turning off the equipment.

regulation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Liquid-cooling systems consist of a sea water or a chilled (fresh) water section that cools the distilled 
water circulating through the electronic equipment. The main components of cooling systems are piping,

transfers the heat load from the electronic equipment to the primary loop. The source of cooling water for 
the primary loop is either sea water from a sea water supply or chilled water from the ship's air-
conditioning plant. The cooling water used in the secondary loop is distilled water. Ultrapure systems are 
maintained by a demineralizer and use double-distilled water obtained through the Navy Supply System.

These hazards result from high levels of rf radiation, X-ray emissions, the necessity of working aloft, and 
the generation of extremely high voltages. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Navy professionals are very safety conscious and, as a result, the number of accidents that occur on 
the job is small. Most of the safety precautions applicable to radar are published in radar technical 
manuals. Many of the safety regulations included in technical manuals are the result of actual 
experiences. Therefore, you should give them careful thought and strict observance. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RF-RADIATION-HAZARDS-4-22-">RF RADIATION HAZARDS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Radar peak power may reach a million watts or more. Rf radiation hazards exist in the vicinity of 
radar transmitting antennas. These hazards are present not only in front of an antenna but also to the sides

excessive levels of radiation will not produce a sufficient sensation of pain or discomfort to warn you of 
injury. If you suspect any injury, see your ship's doctor or corpsman. Be sure to acquaint yourself with the 
actual radiation hazard zones of the radars on your ship. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Personnel should observe the following precautions to ensure that persons are not exposed to 
harmful rf radiation: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Visual inspection of feedhorns, open ends of waveguides, and any other opening that emits rf 
energy should not be made unless the equipment is properly secured and tagged for that purpose.

out the existence of rf radiation hazards in a specific location or area. (You may encounter other 
types of rf radiation hazard signs, depending on the situation.) 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Ensure that radiation hazard warning signs are available and posted.

</p><p class="paragraph">The SPECTRUM ANALYZER and the ECHO BOX are two instruments used to check transmitter 
performance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the more important measurements that can be performed with the echo box is RING TIME. 
Ring time gives a relative indication of both transmitter output power and receiver sensitivity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Transmitter OUTPUT POWER MEASUREMENTS are a good indication of overall transmitter 
operation. POWER MEASUREMENTS are usually of average power read in dBm. The average power 
dBm reading must be converted to watts and the peak power calculated. The formula for peak power is: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">RECEIVER PERFORMANCE CHECKS determine receiver sensitivity, tr recovery time, and 
receiver bandwidth. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You usually measure receiver sensitivity by measuring the MINIMUM DISCERNIBLE SIGNAL 
(mds) using the pulse method. 
</p><p class="paragraph">TR RECOVERY time is the time required for the tr tube to DEIONIZE after each transmitted pulse. 
You should keep a graph of tr recovery time to determine when the tr tube should be replaced. If not 
replaced in a timely manner, a weak tr tube will allow damage to the radar receiver. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Few radars can function without SUPPORT SYSTEMS. These support systems include 
ELECTRICAL POWER, DRY-AIR, and LIQUID-COOLING SYSTEMS. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The radar technician should learn the source and distribution routes for NORMAL and 
EMERGENCY POWER for the radar. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The DRY AIR needed for electronic equipment can be supplied by the ship's electronics dry-air 
system through an air control panel or from local dehydrators. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radar transmitters generate large amounts of heat. Most of this heat is dissipated by a combination of 
AIR CONDITIONING, CABINET AIR BLOWERS, and a DISTILLED-WATER COOLING system. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
