SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CIRCUIT-MEASUREMENT-1-2-">CIRCUIT MEASUREMENT
</h2><p class="paragraph">This chapter will acquaint you with the basics of circuit measurement and some of the devices used
to measure voltage, current, resistance, power, and frequency. There are other quantities involved in
electrical circuits, such as capacitance, inductance, impedance, true power, and effective power. It is
possible to measure any circuit quantity once you are able to select and use the proper circuit measuring
device. You will NOT know all there is to know about circuit measuring devices (test equipment) when
you finish this chapter. That is beyond the scope of this chapter and even beyond the scope of this training
series. However, more information on test equipment is provided in another portion of this training series.
</p><p class="paragraph">A question which you might ask before starting this chapter is "Why do I need to know about circuit
measurement?"</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">If you intend to accomplish anything in the field of electricity and electronics, you must be aware of
the forces acting inside the circuits with which you work. Modules 1 and 2 of this training series
introduced you to the physics involved in the study of electricity and to the fundamental concepts of
direct and alternating current. The terms voltage (volts), current (amperes), and resistance (ohms) were
explained, as well as the various circuit elements; e.g., resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, and
batteries.
</p><p class="paragraph">In explaining these terms and elements to you, schematic symbols and schematic diagrams were
used. In many of these schematic diagrams, a meter was represented in the circuit, as shown in figure 1-1.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you recall, the current in a dc circuit with 6 volts across a 6-ohm resistor is 1 ampere. The
@(UPPERCASE A) in figure 1-1 is the symbol for an ammeter. An ammeter is a device that measures
current. The name "ammeter" comes from the fact that it is a meter used to measure current (in amperes),
and thus is called an AMpere METER, or AMMETER. The ammeter in figure 1-1 is measuring a current
of 1 ampere with the voltage and resistance values given.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the discussion and explanation of electrical and electronic circuits, the quantities in the circuit
(voltage, current, and resistance) are important. If you can measure the electrical quantities in a circuit, it
is easier to understand what is happening in that circuit. This is especially true when you are
troubleshooting defective circuits. By measuring the voltage, current, capacitance, inductance, impedance,
and resistance in a circuit, you can determine why the circuit is not doing what it is supposed to do. For
instance, you can determine why a radio is not receiving or transmitting, why your automobile will not
start, or why an electric oven is not working. Measurement will also assist you in determining why an
electrical component (resistor, capacitor, inductor) is not doing its job.
</p><p class="paragraph">The measurement of the electrical parameters quantities in a circuit is an essential part of working on
electrical and electronic equipment.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-TO-CIRCUIT-MEASUREMENT-1-3-">INTRODUCTION TO CIRCUIT MEASUREMENT
</h2><p class="paragraph">Circuit measurement is used to monitor the operation of an electrical or electronic device, or to
determine the reason a device is not operating properly. Since electricity is invisible, you must use some
sort of device to determine what is happening in an electrical circuit. Various devices called test
equipment are used to measure electrical quantities. The most common types of test equipment use some
kind of metering device.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-IN-CIRCUIT-METERS-1-4-">IN-CIRCUIT METERS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Some electrical and electronic devices have meters built into them. These meters are known as in-
circuit meters. An in-circuit meter is used to monitor the operation of the device in which it is installed.
Some examples of in-circuit meters are the generator or alternator meter on some automobiles; the
voltage, current, and frequency meters on control panels at electrical power plants; and the electrical
power meter that records the amount of electricity used in a building.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is not practical to install an in-circuit meter in every circuit. However, it is possible to install an in-
circuit meter in each critical or representative circuit to monitor the operation of a piece of electrical
equipment. A mere glance at or scan of the in-circuit meters on a control board is often sufficient to tell if
the equipment is working properly.
</p><p class="paragraph">While an in-circuit meter will indicate that an electrical device is not functioning properly, the cause
of the malfunction is determined by troubleshooting. Troubleshooting is the process of locating and
repairing faults in equipment after they have occurred. Since troubleshooting is covered elsewhere in this
training series, it will be mentioned here only as it applies to circuit measurement.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OUT-OF-CIRCUIT-METERS-1-4-">OUT-OF-CIRCUIT METERS
</h2><p class="paragraph">In troubleshooting, it is usually necessary to use a meter that can be connected to the electrical or
electronic equipment at various testing points and may be moved from one piece of equipment to another.
These meters are generally portable and self-contained, and are known as out-of-circuit meters.
</p><p class="paragraph">Out-of-circuit meters are more versatile than in-circuit meters in that the out-of-circuit meter can be
used wherever you wish to connect it. Therefore, the out-of-circuit meter is more valuable in locating the
cause of a malfunction in a device.

 Q2. Why are in-circuit meters used?
 Q3. What is one advantage of an out-of-circuit meter when it is compared with an in-circuit meter?

</h2><p class="paragraph">The meter movement is, as the name implies, the part of a meter that moves. A meter movement
converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. There are many different types of meter movements.
The first one you will learn about is based upon a principle with which you are already familiar. That
principle is the interaction of magnetic fields.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMPASS-AND-CONDUCTING-WIRE-1-4-">COMPASS AND CONDUCTING WIRE

it. If a compass is placed close to the conductor, the compass will react to that magnetic field (fig. 1-2).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">If the battery is disconnected, the north end of the compass needle will point to magnetic north, as
illustrated in figure 1-2(A) by the broken-line compass needle pointing to the right. When the battery is
connected, current flows through the circuit and the compass needle aligns itself with the magnetic field
of the conductor, as indicated by the solid compass needle. The strength of the magnetic field created
around the conductor is dependent upon the amount of current.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 1-2(A), the resistance in the circuit is 6 ohms. With the 6-volt battery shown, current in the
circuit is 1 ampere. In figure 1-2(B), the resistance has been changed to 12 ohms. With the 6-volt battery
shown, current in the circuit is 1/2 or .5 ampere. The magnetic field around the conductor in figure 1-2(B)
is weaker than the magnetic field around the conductor in figure 1-2(A). The compass needle in figure 1-
2(B) does not move as far from magnetic north.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the direction of the current is reversed, the compass needle will move in the opposite direction
because the polarity of the magnetic field has reversed.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 1-2(C), the battery connections are reversed and the compass needle now moves in the
opposite direction.
</p><p class="paragraph">You can construct a crude meter to measure current by using a compass and a piece of paper. By
using resistors of known values, and marking the paper to indicate a numerical value, as in figure 1-3, you
have a device that measures current.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

galvanometer can also use the principles of electrodynamics, which will be covered later in this topic.
</p><p class="paragraph">The meter in figure 1-3 is not very practical for electrical measurement. The amount the compass
needle swings depends upon the closeness of the compass to the conductor carrying the current, the
direction of the conductor in relation to magnetic north, and the influence of other magnetic fields. In
addition, very small amounts of current will not overcome the magnetic field of the Earth and the needle
will not move.

PERMANENT-MAGNET MOVING-COIL MOVEMENT
</p><p class="paragraph">The compass and conducting wire meter can be considered a fixed-conductor moving-magnet device
since the compass is, in reality, a magnet that is allowed to move. The basic principle of this device is the
interaction of magnetic fields-the field of the compass (a permanent magnet) and the field around the
conductor (a simple electromagnet).
</p><p class="paragraph">A permanent-magnet moving-coil movement is based upon a fixed permanent magnet and a coil of
wire which is able to move, as in figure 1-4. When the switch is closed, causing current through the coil,
the coil will have a magnetic field which will react to the magnetic field of the permanent magnet. The
bottom portion of the coil in figure 1-4 will be the north pole of this electromagnet. Since opposite poles
attract, the coil will move to the position shown in figure 1-5.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">To use this permanent-magnet moving-coil device as a meter, two problems must be solved. First, a
way must be found to return the coil to its original position when there is no current through the coil.
Second, a method is needed to indicate the amount of coil movement.
</p><p class="paragraph">The first problem is solved by the use of hairsprings attached to each end of the coil as shown in
figure 1-7. These hairsprings can also be used to make the electrical connections to the coil. With the use
of hairsprings, the coil will return to its initial position when there is no current. The springs will also tend
to resist the movement of the coil when there is current through the coil. When the attraction between the
magnetic fields (from the permanent magnet and the coil) is exactly equal to the force of the hairsprings,
the coil will stop moving toward the magnet.
</p><p class="paragraph">As the current through the coil increases, the magnetic field generated around the coil increases. The
stronger the magnetic field around the coil, the farther the coil will move. This is a good basis for a meter.
</p><p class="paragraph">But, how will you know how far the coil moves? If a pointer is attached to the coil and extended out
to a scale, the pointer will move as the coil moves, and the scale can be marked to indicate the amount of
current through the coil. This is shown in figure 1-8.

iron core is placed inside the coil to concentrate the magnetic fields. Second, curved pole pieces are</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Up to this point, only direct current examples have been used. What happens with the use of
alternating current? Figure 1-11 shows a magnet close to a conductor carrying alternating current at a
frequency of 1 hertz.
</p><p class="paragraph">The compass needle will swing toward the east part of the compass (down) as the current goes
positive, as represented in figure 1-11(A). (The sine wave of the current is shown in the lower portion of
the figure to help you visualize the current in the conductor.)
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 1-11(B), the current returns to zero, and the compass needle returns to magnetic north
(right). As the current goes negative, as in figure 1-11(C), the compass needle swings toward the west
portion of the compass (up). The compass needle returns to magnetic north as the current returns to zero
as shown in figure 1-11(D).
</p><p class="paragraph">This cycle of the current going positive and negative and the compass swinging back and forth will
continue as long as there is alternating current in the conductor.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the frequency of the alternating current is increased, the compass needle will swing back and forth
at a higher rate (faster). At a high enough frequency, the compass needle will not swing back and forth,
but simply vibrate around the magnetic north position. This happens because the needle cannot react fast
enough to the very rapid current alternations. The compass (a simple meter) will indicate the average
value of the alternating current (remember the average value of a sine wave is zero) by vibrating around
the zero point on the meter (magnetic north). This is not of much use if you wish to know the value of the
alternating current. Some device, such as a rectifier, is needed to allow the compass to react to the
alternating current in a way that can be useful in measuring the current.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">By connecting a rectifier to a d’Arsonval meter movement, an alternating current measuring device is
created.
</p><p class="paragraph">When ac is converted to pulsating dc, the d’Arsonval movement will react to the average value of the
pulsating dc (which is the average value of one-half of the sine wave). Another characteristic of using a
rectifier concerns the fact that the d’Arsonval meter movement is capable of indicating current in only one
direction. If the d’Arsonval meter movement were used to indicate alternating current without a rectifier,
or direct current of the wrong polarity, the movement would be severely damaged. The pulsating dc is
current in a single direction, and so the d’Arsonval meter movement can be used as long as proper polarity
is observed.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DAMPING-1-12-">DAMPING
</h2><p class="paragraph">A problem that is created by the use of a rectifier and d’Arsonval meter movement is that the pointer
will vibrate (oscillate) around the average value indication. This oscillation will make the meter difficult
to read.
</p><p class="paragraph">The process of "smoothing out" the oscillation of the pointer is known as DAMPING. There are two
basic techniques used to damp the pointer of a d’Arsonval meter movement.
</p><p class="paragraph">The first method of damping comes from the d’Arsonval meter movement itself. In the d’Arsonval
meter movement, current through the coil causes the coil to move in the magnetic field of the permanent
magnet. This movement of the coil (conductor) through a magnetic field causes a current to be induced in
the coil opposite to the current that caused the movement of the coil. This induced current will act to
damp oscillations. In addition to this method of damping, which comes from the movement itself, most
meters use a second method of damping.
</p><p class="paragraph">The second method of damping used in most meter movements is an airtight chamber containing a
vane (like a windmill vane) attached to the coil (fig.1-14).

meter is removed.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INDICATING-ALTERNATING-CURRENT-1-13-">INDICATING ALTERNATING CURRENT
</h2><p class="paragraph">Another problem encountered in measuring ac is that the meter movement reacts to the average value
of the ac. The value used when working with ac is the effective value (rms value). Therefore, a different
scale is used on an ac meter. The scale is marked with the effective value, even though it is the average
value to which the meter is reacting. That is why an ac meter will give an incorrect reading if used to
measure dc.

movement, except that the permanent magnet is replaced by fixed coils (fig. 1-15). A moving coil, to

these coils. The three coils (two field coils and the moving coil) are connected in series across the meter

</p><p class="paragraph">Current flow in either direction through the three coils causes a magnetic field to exist between the
field coils. The current in the moving coil causes it to act as a magnet and exert a turning force against a
spring. If the current is reversed, the field polarity and the polarity of the moving coil reverse at the same
time, and the turning force continues in the original direction. Since reversing the current direction does
not reverse the turning force, this type of meter can be used to measure both ac and dc if the scale is
changed. While some voltmeters and ammeters use the electrodynamic principle of operation, the most
important application is in the wattmeter. The wattmeter, along with the voltmeter and the ammeter, will
be discussed later in this topic.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MOVING-VANE-METER-MOVEMENTS-1-14-">MOVING-VANE METER MOVEMENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">The moving-vane meter movement (sometimes called the moving-iron movement) is the most
commonly used movement for ac meters. The moving-vane meter operates on the principle of magnetic
repulsion between like poles (fig.1-16). The current to be measured flows through a coil, producing a
magnetic field which is proportional to the strength of the current. Suspended in this field are two iron
vanes. One is in a fixed position, the other, attached to the meter pointer, is movable. The magnetic field
magnetizes these iron vanes with the same polarity regardless of the direction of current flow in the coil.
Since like poles repel, the movable vane pulls away from the fixed vane, moving the meter pointer. This
motion exerts a turning force against the spring. The distance the vane will move against the force of the
spring depends on the strength of the magnetic field, which in turn depends on the coil current.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">These meters are generally used at 60-hertz ac, but may be used at other ac frequencies. By changing
the meter scale to indicate dc values rather than ac rms values, moving-vane meters will measure dc
current and dc voltage. This is not recommended due to the residual magnetism left in the vanes, which
will result in an error in the instrument.
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the major disadvantages of this type of meter movement occurs due to the high reluctance of
the magnetic circuit. This causes the meter to require much more power than the D’Arsonval meter to
produce a full scale deflection, thereby reducing the meters sensitivity.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Hot-wire and thermocouple meter movements both use the heating effect of current flowing through
a resistance to cause meter deflection. Each uses this effect in a different manner. Since their operation
depends only on the heating effect of current flow, they may be used to measure both direct current and
alternating current of any frequency on a single scale.
</p><p class="paragraph">The hot-wire meter movement deflection depends on the expansion of a high-resistance wire caused
by the heating effect of the wire itself as current flows through it. (See fig. 1-17.) A resistance wire is
stretched taut between the two meter terminals, with a thread attached at a right angle to the center of the
wire. A spring connected to the opposite end of the thread exerts a constant tension on the resistance wire.
Current flow heats the wire, causing it to expand. This motion is transferred to the meter pointer through
the thread and a pivot.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

proportion to the amount of current. (See fig. 1-18.) Attached to this wire is a small thermocouple
junction of two unlike metal wires, which connect across a very sensitive dc meter movement (usually a
d’Arsonval meter movement). As the current being measured heats the heating resistor, a small current
(through the thermocouple wires and the meter movement) is generated by the thermocouple junction.
The current being measured flows through only the resistance wire, not through the meter movement
itself. The pointer turns in proportion to the amount of heat generated by the resistance wire.

Figure 1-22 shows the circuit of meter switched to higher ranges, the shunt an ammeter that uses a meter

</p><p class="paragraph">With the switch in the 100 microampere position, all the current being measured will go through the
meter movement. None of the current will go through any of the shunt resistors. If the ammeter is
switched to the 1 milliampere position, the current being measured will have parallel paths of the meter
movement and all the shunt resistors (R1 , R2, R3, and R4). Now, only a portion of the current will go
through the meter movement and the rest of the current will go through the shunt resistors. When the
meter is switched to the 10-milliampere position (as shown in fig. 1-22), only resistors R1, R2, and R3
shunt the meter. Since the resistance of the shunting resistance is less than with R4 in the circuit (as was
the case in the 1-milliampere position), more current will go through the shunt resistors and less current
will go through the meter movement. As the resistance decreases and more current goes through the shunt
resistors. As long as the current to be measured does not exceed the range selected, the meter movement
will never have more than 100 microamperes of current through it.

external shunt resistor serves the same purpose as the internal shunt resistor. The external shunt is
connected in series with the circuit to be measured and in parallel with the ammeter. This shunts
(bypasses) the ammeter so only a portion of the current goes through the meter. Each external shunt will
be marked with the maximum current value that the ammeter will measure when that shunt is used. Figure
1-23 shows an ammeter that is designed to use external shunts and a d’Arsonval meter movement. Figure
1-23(A) shows the internal construction of the meter and the way in which the external shunt is connected
to the meter and to the circuit being measured. Figure 1-23(C) shows some typical external shunts.
</p><p class="paragraph">A shunt resistor is nothing more than a resistor in parallel with the meter movement. To measure
high currents, very small resistance shunts are used so the majority of the current will go through the
shunt. Since the total resistance of a parallel circuit (the meter movement and shunt resistor) is always less
than the resistance of the smallest resistor, as an ammeter’s range is increased, its resistance decreases.
This is important because the load resistance of high-current circuits is smaller than the load resistance of
low-current circuits. To obtain accurate measurements, it is necessary that the ammeter resistance be
much less than the load resistance, since the ammeter is connected in series with the load.

connected in parallel with R2, as in figure 1-26(B), the combined resistance of R2 and R3 (Rn) is equal to 5
ohms. The voltage across R2 and R3 is now 6.25 volts, and that is what the meter will indicate. Notice that
the voltage across R1 and the circuit current have both increased. The addition of the meter (R3) has
loaded the circuit.

resistance of 10 kilohms. The combined resistance of R2 and R4 (Rn) is equal to 9.99 ohms. The voltage
across R2 and R  4 is now 9.99 volts, the value that will be indicated on the meter. This is much closer to
the voltage across R2, with no meter (R3 or R4) in the circuit. Notice that the voltage across R, and the
circuit current in figure 1-26(C) are much closer to the values in 1-26(A). The current (IR4) through the

the meter (R4) has much less effect on the circuit and does not load the circuit as much. Therefore, a

</h2><p class="paragraph">The two instruments most commonly used to check the continuity (a complete circuit), or to measure
the resistance of a circuit or circuit element, are the OHMMETER and the MEGGER (megohm meter).
The ohmmeter is widely used to measure resistance and check the continuity of electrical circuits and
devices. Its range usually extends to only a few megohms. The megger is widely used for measuring
insulation resistance, such as between a wire and the outer surface of the insulation, and insulation
resistance of cables and insulators. The range of a megger may extend to more than 1,000 megohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ohmmeter consists of a dc ammeter, with a few added features. The added features are:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. A dc source of potential (usually a 3-volt battery)
2. One or more resistors (one of which is variable)
3. A simple ohmmeter circuit is shown in figure 1-31.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ohmmeter’s pointer deflection is controlled by the amount of battery current passing through the
moving coil. Before measuring the resistance of an unknown resistor or electrical circuit, the test leads of
the ohmmeter are first shorted together, as shown in figure 1-31. With the leads shorted, the meter is
calibrated for proper operation on the selected range. While the leads are shorted, meter current is
maximum and the pointer deflects a maximum amount, somewhere near the zero position on the ohms</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

leads when you are finished using the ohmmeter. If the leads were left connected, they could come in
contact with each other and discharge the ohmmeter battery. When the variable resistor (rheostat) is
adjusted properly, with the leads shorted, the pointer of the meter will come to rest exactly on the zero
position. This indicates ZERO RESISTANCE between the test leads, which, in fact, are shorted
together. The zero reading of a series-type ohmmeter is on the right-hand side of the scale, where as the
zero reading for an ammeter or a voltmeter is generally to the left-hand side of the scale. (There is another
type of ohmmeter which is discussed a little later on in this chapter.) When the test leads of an ohmmeter
are separated, the pointer of the meter will return to the left side of the scale. The interruption of current
and the spring tension act on the movable coil assembly, moving the pointer to the left side ( ¥ ) of the
scale.

the source voltage of the circuit from being applied across the meter, which could cause damage to the
meter movement.
</p><p class="paragraph">The test leads of the ohmmeter are connected in series with the circuit to be measured (fig. 1-32).
This causes the current produced by the 3-volt battery of the meter to flow through the circuit being
tested. Assume that the meter test leads are connected at points a and b of figure 1-32. The amount of
current that flows through the meter coil will depend on the total resistance of resistors R1 and R2, and the
resistance of the meter. Since the meter has been preadjusted (zeroed), the amount of coil movement now
depends solely on the resistance of R1and R2. The inclusion of R1 and R2 raises the total series resistance,
decreasing the current, and thus decreasing the pointer deflection. The pointer will now come to rest at a
scale figure indicating the combined resistance of R1 and R2. If R1 or R2, or both, were replaced with a
resistor(s) having a larger value, the current flow in the moving coil of the meter would be decreased
further. The deflection would also be further decreased, and the scale indication would read a still higher
circuit resistance. Movement of the moving coil is proportional to the amount of current flow.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OHMMETER-RANGES-1-34-">OHMMETER RANGES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The amount of circuit resistance to be measured may vary over a wide range. In some cases it may
be only a few ohms, and in others it may be as great as 1,000,000 ohms (1 megohm). To enable the meter
to indicate any value being measured, with the least error, scale multiplication features are used in most
ohmmeters. For example, a typical meter will have four test lead jacks-COMMON, R ·  1, R ·  10, and
R · 100. The jack marked COMMON is connected internally through the battery to one side of the
moving coil of the ohmmeter. The jacks marked R ·  1, R ·  10, and R ·  100 are connected to three
different size resistors located within the ohmmeter. This is shown in figure 1-33.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Some ohmmeters are equipped with a selector switch for selecting the multiplication scale desired,
so only two test lead jacks are necessary. Other meters have a separate jack for each range, as shown in
figure 1-33. The range to be used in measuring any particular unknown resistance (Rx in figure 1-33)
depends on the approximate value of the unknown resistance. For instance, assume the ohmmeter in
figure 1-33 is calibrated in divisions from 0 to 1,000. If Rx is greater than 1,000 ohms, and the R x 1 range
is being used, the ohmmeter cannot measure it. This occurs because the combined series resistance of
resistor R ·  1 and Rx is too great to allow sufficient battery current to flow to deflect the pointer away
from infinity ( ¥ ). (Infinity is a quantity larger than the largest quantity you can measure.) The test lead
would have to be plugged into the next range, R ·  10. With this done, assume the pointer deflects to
indicate 375 ohms. This would indicate that Rx has 375 ohms ·  10, or 3,750 ohms resistance. The change
of range caused the deflection because resistor R ·  10 has about 1/10 the resistance of resistor R ·  1.
Thus, selecting the smaller series resistance permitted a battery current of sufficient amount to cause a
useful pointer deflection. If the R ·  100 range were used to measure the same 3,750-ohm resistor, the
pointer would deflect still further, to the 37.5-ohm position. This increased deflection would occur
because resistor R ·  100 has about 1/10 the resistance of resistor R ·  10.
</p><p class="paragraph">The foregoing circuit arrangement allows the same amount of current to flow through the meter’s
moving coil whether the meter measures 10,000 ohms on the R ·  10 scale, or 100,000 ohms on the
R ·  100 scale.
</p><p class="paragraph">It always takes the same amount of current to deflect the pointer to a certain position on the scale
(midscale position for example), regardless of the multiplication factor being used. Since the multiplier
resistors are of different values, it is necessary to ALWAYS "zero" adjust the meter for each
multiplication fact or selected.
</p><p class="paragraph">You should select the multiplication factor (range) that will result in the pointer coming to rest as
near as possible to the midpoint of the scale. This enables you to read the resistance more accurately,
because the scale readings are more easily interpreted at or near midpoint.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MEGOHMMETER-1-38-">MEGOHMMETER
</h2><p class="paragraph">An ordinary ohmmeter cannot be used for measuring resistance of multimillions of ohms, such as in
conductor insulation. To adequately test for insulation break down, it is necessary to use a much higher
potential than is furnished by the battery of an ohmmeter. This potential is placed between the conductor
and the outside surface of the insulation.
</p><p class="paragraph">An instrument called a MEGOHMMETER (MEGGER) is used for these tests. The megger (fig.
1-36) is a portable instrument consisting of two primary elements: (1) a hand-driven dc generator, G,
which supplies the high voltage for making the measurement, and (2) the instrument portion, which
indicates the value of the resistance being measured. The instrument portion is of the opposed-coil type,
as shown in figure 1-36(A). Coils a and b are mounted on the movable member c with a fixed relationship
to each other, and are free to turn as a unit in a magnetic field. Coil b tends to move the pointer
counterclockwise, and coil a tends to move the pointer clockwise.
</p><p class="paragraph">Coil a is connected in series with R3 and the unknown resistance, Rx, to be measured. The
combination of coil, R3, and Rx forms a direct series path between the positive (+) and negative ( - )
brushes of the dc generator. Coil b is connected in series with R2 and this combination is also connected
across the generator. There are no restraining springs on the movable member of the instrument portion of
the megger. Therefore, when the generator is not operated, the pointer floats freely and may come to rest
at any position on the scale.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The guard ring intercepts leakage current. Any leakage currents intercepted are shunted to the
negative side of the generator. They do not flow through coil a; therefore, they do not affect the meter
reading.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the test leads are open-circuited, no current flows in coil a. However, current flows internally
through coil b, and deflects the pointer to infinity, which indicates a resistance too large to measure.
When a resistance such as Rx is connected between the test leads, current also flows in coil a, tending to
move the pointer clockwise. At the same time, coil b still tends to move the pointer counterclockwise.
Therefore, the moving element, composed of both coils and the pointer, comes to rest in a position at
which the two forces are balanced. This position depends upon the value of the external resistance, which
controls the relative amount of current in coil a. Because changes in voltage affect both coil a and coil b
in the same proportion, the position of the moving system is independent of the voltage. If the test leads
are short-circuited, the pointer rests at zero because the current in coil a is relatively large. The instrument
is not damaged under these circumstances because the current is limited by R3.
</p><p class="paragraph">The external view of one type of megger is shown in figure 1-36(B).
Navy meggers are usually rated at 500 volts. To avoid excessive test voltages, most meggers are
</p><p class="paragraph">equipped with friction clutches. When the generator is cranked faster than its rated speed, the clutch slips
and the generator speed and output voltage are not permitted to exceed their rated values. When
extremely high resistances-for example, 10,000 megohms or more-are to be measured, a high voltage is
needed to cause sufficient current flow to actuate the meter movement. For extended ranges, a 1,000-volt
generator is available.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a megger is used, the generator voltage is present on the test leads. This voltage could be
hazardous to you or to the equipment you are checking. Therefore, NEVER TOUCH THE TEST
LEADS WHILE THE MEGGER IS BEING USED and isolate the item you are checking from the
equipment before using the megger.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Using the Megger
</h3><p class="paragraph">To use a megger to check wiring insulation, connect one test lead to the insulation and the other test
lead to the conductor, after isolating the wiring from the equipment. Turn the hand crank until the slip
clutch just begins to slip and note the meter reading. Normal insulations should read infinity. Any small
resistance reading indicates the insulation is breaking down.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Megger Safety Precautions
</h3><p class="paragraph">When you use a megger, you could be injured or damage equipment you are working on if the
following MINIMUM safety precautions are not observed.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Use meggers on high-resistance measurements only (such as insulation measurements or to
check two separate conductors on a cable).
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never touch the test leads while the handle is being cranked.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Deenergize and discharge the circuit completely before connecting a megger.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A MULTIMETER is the most common measuring device used in the Navy. The name multimeter
comes from MULTIple METER, and that is exactly what a multimeter is. It is a dc ammeter, a dc
voltmeter, an ac voltmeter, and an ohmmeter, all in one package. Figure 1-37 is a picture of a typical
multimeter.

</p><p class="paragraph">The multimeter shown in figure 1-37 may look complicated, but it is very easy to use. You have
already learned about ammeters, voltmeters, and ohmmeters; the multimeter is simply a combination of
these meters.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most multimeters use a d’Arsonval meter movement and have a built-in rectifier for ac measurement.
The lower portion of the meter shown in figure 1-37 contains the function switches and jacks (for the
meter leads).
</p><p class="paragraph">The use of the jacks will be discussed first. The COMMON or -jack is used in all functions is
plugged into the COMMON jack. The +jack is used for the second meter lead for any of the functions
printed in large letters beside the FUNCTION SWITCH (the large switch in the center). The other jacks
have specific functions printed above or below them and are self-explanatory (the output jack is used with
the dB scale, which will not be explained in this chapter). To use one of the special function jacks, except
+10 amps, one lead is plugged into the COMMON jack, and the FUNCTION SWITCH is positioned to
point to the special function (small letters). For example, to measure a very small current (20
microamperes), one meter lead would be plugged into the COMMON jack, the other meter lead would be
plugged into the 50A AMPS jack, and the FUNCTION SWITCH would be placed in the 50V/IA AMPS
position. To measure currents above 500 milliamperes, the +10A and - 10A jacks would be used on the
meter with one exception. One meter lead and the FUNCTION SWITCH would be placed in the
10MA/AMPS position.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MULTIMETER-CONTROLS-1-41-">MULTIMETER CONTROLS
</h2><p class="paragraph">As described above, the FUNCTION SWITCH is used to select the function desired; the - DC,
+DC, AC switch selects dc or ac (the rectifier), and changes the polarity of the dc functions. To measure
resistance, this switch should be in the +DC position.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ZERO OHMS control is a potentiometer for adjusting the 0 reading on ohmmeter functions.
Notice that this is a series ohmmeter. The RESET is a circuit breaker used to protect the meter movement
(circuit breakers will be discussed in chapter 2 of this module). Not all multimeters have this protection
but most have some sort of protection, such as a fuse. When the multimeter is not in use, it should have
the leads disconnected and be switched to the highest voltage scale and AC. These switch positions are
the ones most likely to prevent damage if the next person using the meter plugs in the meter leads and
connects the meter leads to a circuit without checking the function switch and the dc/ac selector.

current, and the same numbers are used with the scale just below the numbers for ac voltage and

effective ac voltage and current. The third scale from the top and the numbers just below the scale are
used for the 2.5-volt ac function only. The lowest scale (labeled DB) will not be discussed. The

measured.
</p><p class="paragraph">Table 1-2 shows the figures associated with three meter movements available for use in multimeters.
The last two columns indicate the value of shunt resistance and the overall resistance of the shunt and
meter movement necessary to compensate all three movements to an ammeter sensitivity (full-scale
current) of 1 milliampere. Notice that as the voltmeter sensitivity increases, the resistance of the ammeter
decreases. This shows how a meter movement used in a voltmeter will have a high effective resistance
and the same meter movement used in an ammeter will have a low effective resistance because of the
shunt resistors.

In other words, you must be in line with the pointer and the scale. Figure 1-41 shows the effect of parallax

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WATTMETER-1-48-">WATTMETER
</h2><p class="paragraph">Electric power is measured by means of a wattmeter. This instrument is of the electrodynamic type.
It consists of a pair of fixed coils, known as current coils, and a movable coil known as the potential coil.
(See fig. 1-44.) The fixed coils are made up of a few turns of a comparatively large conductor. The
potential coil consists of many turns of fine wire. It is mounted on a shaft, carried in jeweled bearings, so
that it may turn inside the stationary coils. The movable coil carries a needle which moves over a suitably
marked scale. Spiral coil springs hold the needle to a zero position.
</p><p class="paragraph">The current coil (stationary coil) of the wattmeter is connected in series with the circuit (load), and
the potential coil (movable coil) is connected across the line. When line current flows through the current
coil of a wattmeter, a field is set up around the coil. The strength of this field is proportional to the line
current and in phase with it. The potential coil of the wattmeter generally has a high-resistance resistor
connected in series with it. This is for the purpose of making the potential-coil circuit of the meter as
purely resistive as possible. As a result, current in the potential circuit is practically in phase with line
voltage. Therefore, when voltage is applied to the potential circuit, current is proportional to and in phase
with the line voltage.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The actuating force of a wattmeter comes from the field of its current coil and the field of its
potential coil. The force acting on the movable coil at any instant (tending to turn it) is proportional to the
instantaneous values of line current and voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">The wattmeter consists of two circuits, either of which will be damaged if too much current is passed
through them. This fact is to be especially emphasized in the case of wattmeters, because the reading of
the instrument does not serve to tell the user that the coils are being overheated. If an ammeter or
voltmeter is overloaded, the pointer will be indicating beyond the upper limit of its scale. In the
wattmeter, both the current and potential circuits may be carrying such an overload that their insulation is
burning, and yet the pointer may be only part way up the scale. This is because the position of the pointer
depends upon the power factor of the circuit as well as upon the voltage and current. Thus, a low power-
factor circuit will give a very low reading on the wattmeter even when the current and potential circuits
are loaded to the maximum safe limit. This safe rating is generally given on the face of the instrument. A
wattmeter is always distinctly rated, not in watts but in volts and amperes. Figure 1-45 shows the proper
way to connect a wattmeter in various circuits.

All alternating voltage sources are generated at a set frequency or range of frequencies. A frequency

vibrating-reed frequency meter and the moving-disk frequency meter.

</p><p class="paragraph">The current whose frequency is to be measured flows through the coil and exerts maximum
attraction on the soft-iron armature TWICE during each cycle (fig. 1-47(A)). The armature is attached to
the bar, which is mounted on a flexible support. Reeds having natural vibration frequencies of 110, 112,
114, and so forth, up to 130 hertz are mounted on the bar (fig. 1-47(B)). The reed having a frequency of
110 hertz is marked 55 hertz; the one having a frequency of 112 hertz is marked 56 hertz; the one having
a frequency of 120 hertz is marked 60 hertz; and so forth.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the coil is energized with a current having a frequency between 55 and 65 hertz, all the reeds
are vibrated slightly; but, the reed having a natural frequency closest to that of the energizing current
(whose frequency is to be measured) vibrates more.
</p><p class="paragraph">The frequency is read from the scale value opposite the reed having the greatest vibration.
</p><p class="paragraph">In some instruments the reeds are the same lengths, but are weighted by different amounts at the top
so that they will have different natural rates of vibration.

frequency of 60 hertz per second, the reed marked "60" hertz will vibrate the amount, as shown.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Moving-Disk Frequency Meter
</h3><p class="paragraph">Moving-disk frequency meters are most commonly out-of-circuit meters. They can be used to spot
check the frequency of power sources or equipment signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">A moving-disk frequency meter is shown in figure 1-48. One coil tends to turn the disk clockwise,
and the other, counterclockwise. Magnetizing coil A is connected in series with a large value of
resistance. Coil B is connected in series with a large inductance and the two circuits are supplied in
parallel by the source.
</p><p class="paragraph">For a given voltage, the current through coil A is practically constant. However, the current through
coil B varies with the frequency. At a higher frequency the inductive reactance is greater and the current
through coil B is less; the reverse is true at a lower frequency. The disk turns in the direction determined
by the stronger coil.
</p><p class="paragraph">A perfectly circular disk would tend to turn continuously. This is not desirable, and so the disk is
constructed so that it will turn only a certain amount clockwise or counterclockwise about the center
position, which is commonly marked 60 hertz on commercial equipment. To prevent the disk from
turning more than the desired amount, the left half of the disk is mounted so that when motion occurs, the
same amount of disk area will always be between the poles of coil A. Therefore, the force produced by
coil A to rotate the disk is constant for a constant applied voltage. The right half of the disk is offset, as
shown in the figure. When the disk rotates clockwise, an increasing area will come between the poles of
coil B; when it rotates counterclockwise, a decreasing area will come between the poles of coil B. The
greater the area between the poles, the greater will be the disk current and the force tending to turn the
disk.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the frequency applied to the frequency meter should decrease, the reactance offered by L would
decrease and the field produced by coil B would increase. The field produced by coil A would remain the
same. Thus, the force produced by coil B would tend to move the disk and the pointer counterclockwise</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h1><p class="paragraph">The important points of this chapter are summarized in the following summary. You should be
familiar with these points before continuing with the study of electricity.
</p><p class="paragraph">CIRCUIT MEASUREMENT is used to monitor the operation of a piece of electrical or electronic
equipment and determine the reason the equipment is not functioning properly. In-circuit meters monitor
the operation of equipment and out-of-circuit meters can be used on more than one device.
</p><p class="paragraph">A compass will react to the magnetic field around a conducting wire. As the current increases, the
compass movement increases. If the current decreases, the compass movement is less. If the current
direction changes, the compass movement changes direction. PERMANENT-MAGNET
MOVING-COIL meter movement (d’Arsonval movement) uses the interaction of magnetic fields to
produce movement.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">If a compass is placed close to a conductor with ac, the compass will follow the current alternations
if the ac is of low frequency. A rectifier will allow the compass to react to the average value of the ac.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">DAMPING is used to smooth out the vibration and to help prevent overshooting of the meter
pointer. Damping in a d’Arsonval meter movement is accomplished by the emf caused by the coil
movement. A second damping system uses a vane attached to the coil in an airtight chamber. A meter
movement reacts to the average value of ac, but the scale is calibrated to read the effective (rms) value.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are meter movements that will measure either ac or dc without the use of a rectifier. They are
the ELECTRODYNAMIC, MOVING-VANE, and HOT-WIRE or THERMOCOUPLE movements.
</p><p class="paragraph">Electrodynamic meter movements are usually used in wattmeters. They operate much like a
d’Arsonval meter movement, except field coils are used instead of a permanent magnet.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The thermocouple movement uses the current being developed in a thermocouple when the heat of a
resistive wire is transferred to the thermocouple. The developed current is measured by a very sensitive dc
ammeter. This movement will measure only current.
</p><p class="paragraph">An AMMETER measures current. It is always connected in series with the circuit being measured.
An ammeter should have a small resistance so the effect of the ammeter on the circuit will be kept to a
minimum. Ammeter sensitivity is the amount of current that causes 0 full scale deflection of the ammeter.
Shunt F resistors are used to provide an ammeter’s ranges.
</p><p class="paragraph">The following SAFETY PRECAUTIONS should be observed when using an ammeter.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Always connect an ammeter in series.

being measured. A voltmeter should have a high resistance compared to the circuit being measured to
minimize the loading effect. Since the resistance of a meter movement is constant, a voltmeter can be
made from a current-sensitive meter movement by the use of range resistors and an appropriate scale.
Voltmeter sensitivity is expressed in ohms per volt.

</p><p class="paragraph">CIRCUIT PROTECTION DEVICES
Electricity, like fire, can be either helpful or harmful to those who use it. A fire can keep people
</p><p class="paragraph">warm and comfortable when it is confined in a campfire or a furnace. It can be dangerous and destructive
if it is on the loose and uncontrolled in the woods or in a building. Electricity can provide people with the
light to read by or, in a blinding flash, destroy their eyesight. It can help save people’s lives, or it can kill
them. While we take advantage of the tremendous benefits electricity can provide, we must be careful to
protect the people and systems that use it.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is necessary then, that the mighty force of electricity be kept under control at all times. If for some
reason it should get out of control, there must be a method of protecting people and equipment. Devices
have been developed to protect people and electrical circuits from currents and voltages outside their
normal operating ranges. Some examples of these devices are discussed in this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">While you study this chapter, it should be kept in mind that a circuit protection device is used to keep
an undesirably large current, voltage, or power surge out of a given part of an electrical circuit.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-2-2-">INTRODUCTION
</h2><p class="paragraph">An electrical unit is built with great care to ensure that each separate electrical circuit is fully
insulated from all the others. This is done so that the current in a circuit will follow its intended path.
Once the unit is placed into service, however, many things can happen to alter the original circuitry. Some
of the changes can cause serious problems if they are not detected and corrected. While circuit protection
devices cannot correct an abnormal current condition, they can indicate that an abnormal condition exists
and protect personnel and circuits from that condition. In this chapter, you will learn what circuit
conditions require protection devices and the types of protection devices used.
</p><h3 class="subsection">CIRCUIT CONDITIONS REQUIRING PROTECTION DEVICES
As has been mentioned, many things can happen to electrical and electronic circuits after they are in
</h3><p class="paragraph">use. Chapter 1 of this module contains information showing you how to measure circuit characteristics to
help determine the changes that can occur in them. Some of the changes in circuits can cause conditions
that are dangerous to the circuit itself or to people living or working near the circuits. These potentially
dangerous conditions require circuit protection. The conditions that require circuit protection are direct
shorts, excessive current, and excessive heat.
Direct Short
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the most serious troubles that can occur in a circuit is a DIRECT SHORT. Another term used
to describe this condition is a SHORT CIRCUIT. The two terms mean the same thing and, in this chapter,
the term direct short will be used. This term is used to describe a situation in which some point in the
circuit, where full system voltage is present, comes in direct contact with the ground or return side of the
circuit. This establishes a path for current flow that contains only the very small resistance present in the
wires carrying the current.
</p><p class="paragraph">According to Ohm’s law, if the resistance in a circuit is extremely small, the current will be
extremely large. Therefore, when a direct short occurs, there will be a very large current through the
wires. Suppose, for instance, that the two leads from a battery to a motor came in contact with each other.
If the leads were bare at the point of contact, there would be a direct short. The motor would stop running</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
<div class="page mainpage" id="88"><div class="centered">
            <div class="pagination">
            <a href='#87'>❮</a>
            <a href='#89'>❯</a>
            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">2-3
</p><p class="paragraph">because all the current would be flowing through the short and none through the motor. The battery would
become discharged quickly (perhaps ruined) and there could be the danger of fire or explosion.
</p><p class="paragraph">The battery cables in our example would be large wires capable of carrying heavy currents. Most
wires used in electrical circuits are smaller and their current carrying capacity is limited. The size of wire
used in any given circuit is determined by space considerations, cost factors, and the amount of current
the wire is expected to carry under normal operating conditions. Any current flow greatly in excess of
normal, such as there would be in the case of a direct short, would cause a rapid generation of heat in the
wire.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the excessive current flow caused by the direct short is left unchecked, the heat in the wire will
continue to increase until some portion of the circuit burns. Perhaps a portion of the wire will melt and
open the circuit so that nothing is damaged other than the wire involved. The probability exists, however,
that much greater damage will result. The heat in the wire can char and burn the insulation of the wire and
that of other wires bundled with it, which can cause more shorts. If a fuel or oil leak is near any of the hot
wires, a disastrous fire might be started.
Excessive Current
</p><p class="paragraph">It is possible for the circuit current to increase without a direct short. If a resistor, capacitor, or
inductor changes value, the total circuit impedance will also change in value. If a resistor decreases in
ohmic value, the total circuit resistance decreases. If a capacitor has a dielectric leakage, the capacitive
reactance decreases. If an inductor has a partial short of its winding, inductive reactance decreases. Any
of these conditions will cause an increase in circuit current. Since the circuit wiring and components are
designed to withstand normal circuit current, an increase in current would cause overheating (just as in
the case of a direct short). Therefore, excessive current without a direct short will cause the same
problems as a direct short.
Excessive Heat
</p><p class="paragraph">As you have read, most of the problems associated with a direct short or excessive current concern
the heat generated by the higher current. The damage to circuit components, the possibility of fire, and the
possibility of hazardous fumes being given off from electrical components are consequences of excessive
heat. It is possible for excessive heat to occur without a direct short or excessive current. If the bearings
on a motor or generator were to fail, the motor or generator would overheat. If the temperature around an
electrical or electronic circuit were to rise (through failure of a cooling system for example), excessive
heat would be a problem. No matter what the cause, if excessive heat is present in a circuit, the possibility
of damage, fire, and hazardous fumes exists.

circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">A circuit protection device operates by opening and interrupting current to the circuit. The opening
of a protection device shows that something is wrong in the circuit and should be corrected before the
current is restored. When a problem exists and the protection device opens, the device should isolate the
faulty circuit from the other unaffected circuits, and should respond in time to protect unaffected
components in the faulty circuit. The protection device should NOT open during normal circuit operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">The two types of circuit protection devices discussed in this chapter are fuses and circuit breakers.
Fuses
</p><p class="paragraph">A fuse is the simplest circuit protection device. It derives its name from the Latin word "fusus,"
meaning "to melt." Fuses have been used almost from the beginning of the use of electricity. The earliest
type of fuse was simply a bare wire between two connections. The wire was smaller than the conductor it
was protecting and, therefore, would melt before the conductor it was protecting was harmed. Some
"copper fuse link" types are still in use, but most fuses no longer use copper as the fuse element (the part
of the fuse that melts). After changing from copper to other metals, tubes or enclosures were developed to
hold the melting metal. The enclosed fuse made possible the addition of filler material, which helps to
contain the arc that occurs when the element melts.
</p><p class="paragraph">For many low power uses, the finer material is not required. A simple glass tube is used. The use of a
glass tube gives the added advantage of being able to see when a fuse is open. Fuses of this type are
commonly found in automobile lighting circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-1 shows several fuses and the symbols used on schematics.

</p><p class="paragraph">Circuit Breakers
While a fuse protects a circuit, it is destroyed in the process of opening the circuit. Once the problem
</p><p class="paragraph">that caused the increased current or heat is corrected, a new fuse must be placed in the circuit. A circuit
protection device that can be used more than once solves the problems of replacement fuses. Such a
device is safe, reliable, and tamper proof. It is also resettable, so it can be reused without replacing any
parts. This device is called a CIRCUIT BREAKER because it breaks (opens) the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">The first compact, workable circuit breaker was developed in 1923. It took 4 years to design a device
that would interrupt circuits of 5000 amperes at 120 volts ac or dc. In 1928 the first circuit breaker was
placed on the market. A typical circuit breaker and the appropriate schematic symbols are shown in figure
2-2.

</p><p class="paragraph">FUSE TYPES
Fuses are manufactured in many shapes and sizes. In addition to the copper fuse link already
</p><p class="paragraph">described, figure 2-1 shows other fuse types. While the variety of fuses may seem confusing, there are
basically only two types of fuses: plug-type fuses and cartridge fuses. Both types of fuses use either a
single wire or a ribbon as the fuse element (the part of the fuse that melts). The condition (good or bad) of
some fuses can be determined by visual inspection. The condition of other fuses can only be determined
with a meter. In the following discussion, visual inspection will be described. The use of meters to check
fuses will be discussed later in this chapter.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PLUG-TYPE-FUSE-2-6-">PLUG-TYPE FUSE
</h2><p class="paragraph">The plug-type fuse is constructed so that it can be screwed into a socket mounted on a control panel
or electrical distribution center. The fuse link is enclosed in an insulated housing of porcelain or glass.
The construction is arranged so the fuse link is visible through a window of mica or glass. Figure 2-4
shows a typical plug-type fuse.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-4, view A, sows a good plug-type fuse. Notice the construction and the fuse link. In figure
2-4, view B, the same type of fuse is shown after the fuse link has melted. Notice the window showing the
indication of this open fuse. The indication could be either of the ones shown in figure 2-4, view B.
</p><p class="paragraph">The plug-type fuse is used primarily in low-voltage, low-current circuits. The operating range is
usually up to 150 volts and from 0.5 ampere to 30 amperes. This type of fuse is found in older circuit
protection devices and is rapidly being replaced by the circuit breaker.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CARTRIDGE-FUSE-2-6-">CARTRIDGE FUSE
</h2><p class="paragraph">The cartridge fuse operates exactly like the plug-type fuse. In the cartridge fuse, the fuse link is
enclosed in a tube of insulating material with metal ferrules at each end (for contact with the fuse holder).
Some common insulating materials are glass, bakelite, or a fiber tube filled with insulating powder.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FUSE-RATINGS-2-8-">FUSE RATINGS
</h2><p class="paragraph">You can determine the physical size and type of a fuse by looking at it, but you must know other
things about a fuse to use it properly. Fuses are rated by current, voltage, and time-delay characteristics to
aid in the proper use of the fuse. To select the proper fuse, you must understand the meaning of each of
the fuse ratings.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CURRENT-RATING-2-8-">CURRENT RATING
</h2><p class="paragraph">The current rating of a fuse is a value expressed in amperes that represents the current the fuse will
allow without opening. The current rating of a fuse is always indicated on the fuse.
</p><p class="paragraph">To select the proper fuse, you must know the normal operating current of the circuit. If you wish to
protect the circuit from overloads (excessive current), select a fuse rated at 125 percent of the normal
circuit current. In other words, if a circuit has a normal current of 10 amperes, a 12.5-ampere fuse will
provide overload protection. If you wish to protect against direct shorts only, select a fuse rated at 150
percent of the normal circuit current. In the case of a circuit with 10 amperes of current, a 15 ampere fuse
will protect against direct shorts, but will not be adequate protection against excessive current.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-VOLTAGE-RATING-2-8-">VOLTAGE RATING
</h2><p class="paragraph">The voltage rating of a fuse is NOT an indication of the voltage the fuse is designed to withstand
while carrying current. The voltage rating indicates the ability of the fuse to quickly extinguish the arc
after the fuse element melts and the maximum voltage the open fuse will block. In other words, once the
fuse has opened, any voltage less than the voltage rating of the fuse will not be able to "jump" the gap of
the fuse. Because of the way the voltage rating is used, it is a maximum rms voltage value. You must
always select a fuse with a voltage rating equal to or higher than the voltage in the circuit you wish to
protect.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TIME-DELAY-RATING-2-8-">TIME DELAY RATING
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are many kinds of electrical and electronic circuits that require protection. In some of these
circuits, it is important to protect against temporary or transient current increases. Sometimes the device
being protected is very sensitive to current and cannot withstand an increase in current. In these cases, a
fuse must open very quickly if the current increases.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some other circuits and devices have a large current for short periods and a normal (smaller) current
most of the time. An electric motor, for instance, will draw a large current when the motor starts, but
normal operating current for the motor will be much smaller. A fuse used to protect a motor would have
to allow for this large temporary current, but would open if the large current were to continue.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fuses are time delay rated to indicate the relationship between the current through the fuse and the
time it takes for the fuse to open. The three time delay ratings are delay, standard, and fast.
Delay
</p><p class="paragraph">A delay, or slow-blowing, fuse has a built-in delay that is activated when the current through the fuse
is greater than the current rating of the fuse. This fuse will allow temporary increases in current (surge)
without opening. Some delay fuses have two elements; this allows a very long time delay. If the over-
current condition continues, a delay fuse will open, but it will take longer to open than a standard or a fast
fuse.
</p><p class="paragraph">Delay fuses are used for circuits with high surge or starting currents, such as motors, solenoids, and
transformers.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Standard
Standard fuses have no built-in time delay. Also, they are not designed to be very fast acting.
</p><p class="paragraph">Standard fuses are sometimes used to protect against direct shorts only. They may be wired in series with
a delay fuse to provide faster direct short protection. For example, in a circuit with a 1-ampere delay fuse,
a 5-ampere standard fuse may be used in addition to the delay fuse to provide faster protection against a
direct short.
</p><p class="paragraph">A standard fuse can be used in any circuit where surge currents are not expected and a very fast
opening of the fuse is not needed. A standard fuse opens faster than a delay fuse, but slower than a fast
rated fuse.
</p><p class="paragraph">Standard fuses can be used for automobiles, lighting circuits, or electrical power circuits.
Fast
</p><p class="paragraph">Fast fuses are designed to open very quickly when the current through the fuse exceeds the current
rating of the fuse. Fast fuses are used to protect devices that are very sensitive to increased current. A fast
fuse will open faster than a delay or standard fuse.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fast fuses can be used to protect delicate instruments or semiconductor devices.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-7 will help you understand the differences between delay, standard, and fast fuses. Figure
2-7 shows that, if a 1-ampere rated fuse had 2 amperes of current through it, (200% of the rated value), a
fast fuse would open in about .7 second, a standard rated fuse would open in about 1.5 seconds, and a
delay rated fuse would open in about 10 seconds. Notice that in each of the fuses, the time required to
open the fuse decreases as the rated current increases.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fuses have identifications printed on them. The printing on the fuse will identify the physical size,
the type of fuse, and the fuse ratings. There are four different systems used to identify fuses. The systems
are the old military designation, the new military designation, the old commercial designation, and the
new commercial designation. All four systems are presented here, so you will be able to identify a fuse no
matter which designation is printed on the fuse.
</p><p class="paragraph">You may have to replace an open fuse that is identified by one system with a good fuse that is
identified by another system. The designation systems are fairly simple to understand and cross-reference
once you are familiar with them.

in figure 2-8.
</p><p class="paragraph">The old military designation always starts with "F," which stands for fuse. Next, the set of numbers
(02) indicates the style. Style means the construction and dimensions (size) of the fuse. Following the

numbers (02) next to this indicates the style. The style numbers are identical to the ones used in the old
military designation and indicate the construction and dimensions of the fuse. Following the style
designation is a single letter (A) that indicates the time delay rating of the fuse. This is the same time
delay rating code as indicated in the old military designation, but the position of this letter in the coding is
changed to avoid confusing the "A" for standard time delay with the "A" for ampere. Following the time
delay rating is the voltage rating of the fuse (250) V. In the old military designation, a letter was used to
indicate the voltage rating. In the new military designation, the voltage is indicated by numbers followed
by a "V," which stands for volts or less. After the voltage rating, the current rating is given by numbers
followed by the letter "A." The current rating may be a whole number (1A), a fraction (1/500 A), a whole
number and a fraction (1 1/2A), a decimal (0.250A), or a whole number and a decimal (1.50A). If the
ferrules of the fuse are silver-plated, the current rating will be followed by the letter "S." If any other
plating is used, the current rating will be the last part of the fuse identification.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

or soldered to the wiring of circuits, but most circuits make use of FUSEHOLDERS. A fuseholder is a

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CLIP-TYPE-FUSEHOLDER-2-14-">CLIP-TYPE FUSEHOLDER
</h2><p class="paragraph">The clip-type fuseholder is used for cartridge fuses. The ferrules or knife blade of the fuse are held
by the spring tension of the clips. These clips provide the electrical connection between the fuse and the
circuit. If a glass-bodied fuse is used, the fuse can be inspected visually for an open without removing the
fuse from the fuse holder. Clip-type fuseholders are made in several sizes to hold the many styles of fuses.
The clips maybe made for ferrules or knife blade cartridge fuses. While the base of a clip-type fuseholder
is made from insulating material, the clips themselves are conductors. The current through the fuse goes
through the clips and care must be taken to not touch the clips when there is power applied. If the clips are
touched, with power applied, a severe shock or a short circuit will occur.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-POST-TYPE-FUSEHOLDERS-2-14-">POST-TYPE FUSEHOLDERS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Post-type fuseholders are made for cartridge fuses. The post-type fuseholder is much safer because
the fuse and fuse connections are covered with insulating material. The disadvantage of the post-type
fuseholder is that the fuse must be removed to visually check for an open. The post-type fuseholder has a
cap that screws onto the body of the fuseholder. The fuse is held in this cap by a spring-type connector
and, as the cap is screwed on, the fuse makes contact with the body of the fuseholder. When the cap and
fuse are removed from the body of the fuseholder, the fuse is removed from the circuit and there is no
danger of shock or short circuit from touching the fuse.
</p><p class="paragraph">Post-type fuseholders are usually mounted on the chassis of the equipment in which they are used.
After wires are connected to the fuseholder, insulating sleeves are placed over the connections to reduce
the possibility of a short circuit. Notice the two connections on the post-type fuseholder of figure 2-11.
The connection on the right is called the center connector. The other connector is the outside connector.
The outside connector will be closer to the equipment chassis. (The threads and nut shown are used to
fasten the fuseholder to the chassis.) The possibility of the outside connector coming in contact with the
chassis (causing a short circuit) is much higher than the possibility of the center conductor contacting the
chassis. The power source should always be connected to the center connector so the fuse will open if the
outside connector contacts the chassis. If the power source were connected to the outside connector, and
the outside connector contacted the chassis, there would be a direct short, but the fuse would not open.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">A fuse, if properly used, should not open unless something is wrong in the circuit the fuse is
protecting. When a fuse is found to be open, you must determine the reason the fuse is open. Replacing
the fuse is not enough.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before you look for the cause of an open fuse, you must be able to determine if the fuse is open.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CHECKING-FOR-AN-OPEN-FUSE-2-15-">CHECKING FOR AN OPEN FUSE
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are several ways of checking for an open fuse. Some fuses and fuseholders have indicators
built in to help you find an open fuse; also, a multimeter can be used to check fuses. The simplest way to
check glass-bodied fuses, and the method you should use first, is visual inspection.
Visual Inspection
</p><p class="paragraph">An open glass-bodied fuse can usually be found by visual inspection. Earlier in this chapter, figures
2-4 and 2-5 showed you how an open plug-type and an open glass-bodied cartridge-type fuse would look.
If the fuse element is not complete, or if the element has been melted onto the glass tube, the fuse is open.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is not always possible to tell if a fuse is open by visual inspection. Fuses with low current ratings
have elements that are so small, it is sometimes not possible to know if the fuse link is complete simply
by looking at it. If the fuse is not glass-bodied, it will not be possible to check the fuse visually. Also,
sometimes a fuse will look good, but will, in fact, be open. Therefore, while it is sometimes possible to
know if a fuse is open by visual inspection, it is not possible to be sure a fuse is good just by looking at it.
Fuse Indicators
</p><p class="paragraph">Some fuses and fuseholders have built-in indicators to show when a fuse is open. Examples of these
open-fuse indicators are shown in figure 2-13. Figure 2-13, view A, shows a cartridge-type fuse with an
open-fuse indicator. The indicator is spring loaded and held by the fuse link. If the fuse link opens, the
spring forces the indicator out. Some manufacturers color the indicator so it is easier to see in the
open-fuse position.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

fuse opens, the lamp in the fuse cap will light. Figure 2-13, view C, shows a clip-type fuseholder with an
indicating lamp.
</p><p class="paragraph">Just as in visual checking, the indicator can show an open fuse. Since the indicator may not always
work, you cannot be sure a fuse is good just because there is no open-fuse indication.
Checking Fuses with a Meter
</p><p class="paragraph">The only sure method of determining if a fuse is open is to use a meter. An ohmmeter can be used to
check for an open fuse by removing the fuse from the circuit and checking for continuity through the fuse
(0 ohms). If the fuse is not removed from the circuit, and the fuse is open, the ohmmeter may measure the
circuit resistance. This resistance reading might lead you to think the fuse is good. You must be careful
when you use an ohmmeter to check fuses with small current ratings (such as 1/32 ampere or less),
because the current from the ohmmeter may be larger than the current rating of the fuse. For most
practical uses, a small current capacity fuse can be checked out of the circuit through the use of a resistor.
The ohmic value of the resistor is first measured and then placed in series with the fuse. The continuity
reading on the ohmmeter should be of the same value, or close to it, as the original value of the resistor.
This method provides protection for the fuse by dropping the voltage across the resistor. This in turn
decreases the power in the form of heat at the fuse. Remember, it is heat which melts the fuse element.
</p><p class="paragraph">A voltmeter can also be used to check for an open fuse. The measurement is taken between each end
of the fuse and the common or ground side of the line. If voltage is present on both sides of the fuse (from
the voltage source and to the load), the fuse is not open. Another method commonly used, is to measure
across the fuse with the voltmeter. If NO voltage is indicated on the meter, the fuse is good, (not open).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

points built in to allow you to check the voltage. To check for voltage on a clip-type fuseholder, check
each of the clips. The advantage of using a voltmeter to check for an open fuse is that the circuit does not
have to be deenergized and the fuse does not have to be removed.

</h2><p class="paragraph">After an open fuse is found and the trouble that caused the fuse to open has been corrected, the fuse
must be replaced. Before you replace the fuse, you must be certain the replacement fuse is the proper type
and fits correctly.
Proper Type of Replacement Fuse
</p><p class="paragraph">To be certain a fuse is the proper type, check the technical manual for the equipment. The parts list
will show you the proper fuse identification for a replacement fuse. Obtain the exact fuse specified, if
possible, and check the identification number of the replacement fuse against the parts list.
</p><p class="paragraph">If you cannot obtain a direct replacement, use the following guidelines:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never use a fuse with a higher current rating, a lower voltage rating, or a slower time delay
rating than the specified fuse.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">• The best substitution fuse is a fuse with the same current and time delay ratings and a higher
voltage rating.
</p><p class="paragraph">• If a lower current rating or a faster time delay rating is used, the fuse may open under normal
circuit conditions.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Substitute fuses must have the same style (physical dimensions) as the specified fuse.
Proper Fit of Replacement Fuses
</p><p class="paragraph">When you have obtained a proper replacement fuse, you must make certain it will fit correctly in the
fuseholder. If the fuseholder is corroded, the fuse will not fit properly. In addition, the corrosion can cause
increased resistance or heating. Clean corroded terminals with fine sandpaper so that all corrosion is
removed. Do NOT lubricate the terminals. If the terminals are badly pitted, replace the fuseholder. Be
certain the replacement fuseholder is the correct size and type by checking the parts list in the technical
manual for the equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">After you check for and correct any corrosion problems, be certain the fuse fits tightly in the
fuseholder. When you insert the fuse in the cap of a plug-type fuseholder, the fuse should fit tightly. A
small amount of pressure should be needed to insert the fuse and cap into the fuseholder body.
</p><p class="paragraph">In clip-type fuseholders, the clips can be easily bent out of shape. This causes an incorrect fit, which
in time could cause an equipment malfunction. Figure 2-14 shows examples of correct and incorrect fuse
contacts for clip-type fuseholders used with knifeblade and ferrule cartridge fuses. The clips shown in the
left picture of each row have the correct contact. The three pictures on the right of each row show
incorrect contact. Notice how the clips are not contacting completely with the knifeblade or ferrules. This
incomplete contact can. cause corrosion at the contacts, which in turn can create a high resistance and
drop some of the circuit voltage at this point.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the fuse clips do not make complete contact with the fuse, try to bend the clips back into shape. If
the clips cannot be repaired by bending, replace the fuseholder or use clip clamps. Clip clamps are shown
in figure 2-15.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">2. CORROSION. Check for corrosion on the fuseholder terminals or the fuse itself. If corrosion is
present, remove it with fine sandpaper.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. IMPROPER FIT. Check for contact between the fuse and fuseholder. If a piece of paper will fit
between the fuse and the clips on a clip-type fuseholder, there is improper contact. If the fuse is

</h2><p class="paragraph">A circuit breaker is a circuit protection device that, like a fuse, will stop current in the circuit if there
is a direct short, excessive current, or excessive heat. Unlike a fuse, a circuit breaker is reusable. The
circuit breaker does not have to be replaced after it has opened or broken the circuit. Instead of replacing
the circuit breaker, you reset it.
</p><p class="paragraph">Circuit breakers can also be used as circuit control devices. By manually opening and closing the
contacts of a circuit breaker, you can switch the power on and off. Circuit control devices will be covered
in more detail in the next chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Circuit breakers are available in a great variety of sizes and types. It would not be possible to
describe every type of circuit breaker in use today, but this chapter will describe the basic types of circuit
breakers and their operational principles.
</p><p class="paragraph">Circuit breakers have five main components, as shown in figure 2-16. The components are the frame,
the operating mechanism, the arc extinguishers and contacts, the terminal connectors, and the trip
elements.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

2-17). The frame determines the physical size of the circuit breaker and the maximum allowable voltage
and current.
</p><p class="paragraph">The OPERATING MECHANISM provides a means of opening and closing the breaker contacts
(turning, the circuit ON and OFF). The toggle mechanism shown in figure 2-17 is the quick-make,
quick-break type, which means the contacts snap open or closed quickly, regardless of how fast the
handle is moved. In addition to indicating whether the breaker is ON or OFF, the operating mechanism
handle indicates when the breaker has opened automatically (tripped) by moving to a position between
ON and OFF. To reset the circuit breaker, the handle must first be moved to the OFF position, and then to
the ON position.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

time the circuit breaker interrupts current. The arc extinguisher is actually a series of contacts that open
gradually, dividing the arc and making it easier to confine and extinguish. This is shown in figure 2-18.
Arc extinguishers are generally used in circuit breakers that control a large amount of power, such as
those found in power distribution panels. Small power circuit breakers (such as those found in lighting
panels) may not have arc extinguishers.
</p><p class="paragraph">TERMINAL CONNECTORS are used to connect the circuit breaker to the power source and the
load. They are electrically connected to the contacts of the circuit breaker and provide the means of

using current transformers and solid-state circuitry.)
THERMAL TRIP ELEMENT
</p><p class="paragraph">A thermal trip element circuit breaker uses a bimetallic element that is heated by the load current.
The bimetallic element is made from strips of two different metals bonded together. The metals expand at
different rates as they are heated. This causes the bimetallic element to bend as it is heated by the current
going to the load. Figure 2-19 shows how this can be used to trip the circuit breaker.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-19, view A, shows the trip element with normal current. The bimetallic element is not
heated excessively and does not bend. If the current increases (or the temperature around the circuit
breaker increases), the bimetallic element bends, pushes against the trip bar, and releases the latch. Then,
the contacts open, as shown in figure 2-19, view B.
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of time it takes for the bimetallic element to bend and trip the circuit breaker depends on
the amount the element is heated. A large overload will heat the element quickly. A small overload will
require a longer time to trip the circuit breaker.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MAGNETIC-TRIP-ELEMENT-2-23-">MAGNETIC TRIP ELEMENT
</h2><p class="paragraph">A magnetic trip element circuit breaker uses an electromagnet in series with the circuit load as in
figure 2-20. With normal current, the electromagnet will not have enough attraction to the trip bar to
move it, and the contacts will remain closed as shown in figure 2-20, view A. The strength of the
magnetic field of the electromagnet increases as current through the coil increases. As soon as the current
in the circuit becomes large enough, the trip bar is pulled toward the magnetic element (electromagnet),
the contacts are opened, and the current stops, as shown in figure 2-20, view B.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of current needed to trip the circuit breaker depends on the size of the gap between the
trip bar and the magnetic element. On some circuit breakers, this gap (and therefore the trip current) is
adjustable.
THERMAL-MAGNETIC TRIP ELEMENT
</p><p class="paragraph">The thermal trip element circuit breaker, like a delay fuse, will protect a circuit against a small
overload that continues for a long time. The larger the overload, the faster the circuit breaker will trip.
The thermal element will also protect the circuit against temperature increases. A magnetic circuit breaker
will trip instantly when the preset current is present. In some applications, both types of protection are
desired. Rather than use two separate circuit breakers, a single trip element combining thermal and
magnetic trip elements is used. A thermal-magnetic trip element is shown in figure 2-21.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

breaker that will trip (open) even if the operating mechanism (ON-OFF switch) is held in the ON

breakers were rated with the same time delay, an overload on load 5 could cause CB1, CB3, and CB8 to
trip. This would remove power from all seven loads, even though load 5 was the only circuit with an
overload.
</p><p class="paragraph">Selective tripping would have CB1 rated as long time delay, CB2 and CB3 rated as short time delay,

</h2><p class="paragraph">Circuit control devices are used everywhere that electrical or electronic circuits are used. They are
found in submarines, computers, aircraft, televisions, ships, space vehicles, medical instruments, and
many other places. In this chapter you will learn what circuit control devices are, how they are used, and
some of their characteristics.
</p><p class="paragraph">INTRODUCTION
Electricity existed well before the beginning of recorded history. Lightning was a known and feared
</p><p class="paragraph">force to early man, but the practical uses of electricity were not recognized until the late 18th century. The
early experimenters in electricity controlled power to their experiments by disconnecting a wire from a
battery or by the use of a clutch between a generator and a steam engine. As practical uses were found for
electricity, a convenient means for turning power on and off was needed.
</p><p class="paragraph">Telegraph systems, tried as early as the late 1700s and perfected by Morse in the 1830s, used a
mechanically operated contact lever for opening and closing the signal circuit. This was later replaced by
the hand-operated contact lever or "key."
</p><p class="paragraph">Early power switches were simple hinged beams, arranged to close or open a circuit. The blade-and-
jaw knife switch with a wooden, slate, or porcelain base and an insulated handle, was developed a short
time later. This was the beginning of circuit control devices.
</p><p class="paragraph">Modern circuit control devices can change their resistance from a few milliohms (when closed) to
well over 100,000 megaohms (when open) in a couple of milliseconds. In some circuit control devices,
the movement necessary to cause the device to open or close is only .001 inch (.025 millimeters).
NEED FOR CIRCUIT CONTROL
</p><p class="paragraph">Circuit control, in its simplest form, is the application and removal of power. This can also be
expressed as turning a circuit on and off or opening and closing a circuit. Before you learn about the types
of circuit control devices, you should know why circuit control is needed.
</p><p class="paragraph">If a circuit develops problems that could damage the equipment or endanger personnel, it should be
possible to remove the power from that circuit. The circuit protection devices discussed in the last chapter
will remove power automatically if current or temperature increase enough to cause the circuit protection
device to act. Even with this protection, a manual means of control is needed to allow you to remove
power from the circuit before the protection device acts.
</p><p class="paragraph">When you work on a circuit, you often need to remove power from it to connect test equipment or to
remove and replace components. When you remove power from a circuit so that you can work on it, be</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

work has been completed, power must be restored to the circuit. This will allow you to check the proper
operation of the circuit and place it back in service. After the circuit has been checked for proper
operation, remove the tag from the power switch.
</p><p class="paragraph">Many electrical devices are used some of the time and not needed at other times. Circuit control
devices allow you to turn the device on when it is needed and off when it is not needed.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some devices, like multimeters or televisions, require the selection of a specific function or circuit.
A circuit control device makes possible the selection of the particular circuit you wish to use.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SWITCH-TYPES-3-4-">SWITCH TYPES
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are thousands and thousands of switch applications found in home, industry, and the Navy.
Hundreds of electrical switches work for you everyday to perform functions you take for granted. Some
switches operate by the touch of a finger and many others are operated automatically.
</p><p class="paragraph">Switches are used in the home to turn off the alarm clock, to control the stove, to turn on the
refrigerator light, to turn on and control radios and televisions, hair dryers, dishwashers, garbage
disposals, washers and dryers, as well as to control heating and air conditioning. A typical luxury
automobile with power seats and windows might have as many as 45 switches.
</p><p class="paragraph">Industry uses switches in a wide variety of ways. They are found in the business office on computers,
copy machines, electric typewriters, and other equipment. A factory or shop may use thousands of
switches and they are found on almost every piece of machinery. Switches are used on woodworking
machinery, metal working machinery, conveyors, automation devices, elevators, hoists, and lift trucks.
</p><p class="paragraph">The Navy uses switches in a number of ways. A typical aircraft could have over 250 switches to
control lights, electronic systems, and to indicate whether the landing gear is up or down. Ships, fire
control systems, and missile launchers are also controlled by electrical switches. In fact, almost all
electrical or electronic devices will have at least one switch.
</p><p class="paragraph">Switches are designed to work in many different environments from extreme high pressure, as in a
submarine, to extreme low pressure, as in a spacecraft. Other environmental conditions to consider are
high or low temperature, rapid temperature changes, humidity, liquid splashing or immersion, ice,
corrosion, sand or dust, fungus, shock or vibration, and an explosive atmosphere.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">It would not be possible to describe all the different switches used. This chapter will describe the
most common types of switches.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MANUAL-SWITCHES-3-5-">MANUAL SWITCHES
</h2><p class="paragraph">A manual switch is a switch that is controlled by a person. In other words, a manual switch is a
switch that you turn on or off. Examples of common manual switches are a light switch, the ignition
switch on a motor vehicle, or the channel selector on a television. You may not think of the channel
selector as a switch that you use to turn something on or off, but that is what it does. The channel selector
is used to turn on the proper circuit and allows the television to receive the channel you have selected.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-AUTOMATIC-SWITCH-3-5-">AUTOMATIC SWITCH
</h2><p class="paragraph">An automatic switch is a switch that is controlled by a mechanical or electrical device. You do not
have to turn an automatic switch on or off. Two examples of automatic switches are a thermostat and the
distributor in a motor vehicle. The thermostat will turn a furnace or air conditioner on or off by
responding to the temperature in a room. The distributor electrically turns on the spark plug circuit at the
proper time by responding to the mechanical rotation of a shaft. Even the switch that turns on the light in
a refrigerator when the door is opened is an automatic switch.
</p><p class="paragraph">Automatic switches are not always as simple as the examples given above. Limit switches, which
sense some limit such as fluid level, mechanical movement, pressure (altitude or depth under water), or an
electrical quantity, are automatic switches. Computers use and control automatic switches that are
sometimes quite complicated.
</p><p class="paragraph">Basically, any switch that will turn a circuit on or off without human action is an automatic switch.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MULTICONTACT-SWITCHES-3-5-">MULTICONTACT SWITCHES
</h2><p class="paragraph">Switches are sometimes used to control more than one circuit or to select one of several possible
circuits. An example of a switch controlling more than one circuit is the AM/FM selector on a radio. This
switch enables you to control either the AM or FM portion of the radio with a single switch. An example
of a switch that selects one of several circuits is the channel selector of a television set. These switches are
called MULTICONTACT switches because they have more than one contact or MULTI(ple)
CONTACTS.
Number of Poles and Number of Throws
</p><p class="paragraph">Multicontact switches (other than rotary switches, which will be covered later) are usually classified
by the number of POLES and number of THROWS. Poles are shown in schematics as those contacts
through which current enters the switch; they are connected to the movable contacts. Each pole may be
connected to another part of the circuit through the switch by "throwing" the switch (movable contacts) to
another position. This action provides an individual conduction path through the switch for each pole
connection. The number of THROWS indicates the number of different circuits that can be controlled by
each pole. By counting the number of points where current enters the switch (from the schematic symbol
or the switch itself), you can determine the number of poles. By counting the number of different points
each pole can connect with, you can determine the number of throws.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-3 will help you understand this concept by showing illustrations of various multicontact
switches and their schematic symbols.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-3(A) shows a single-pole, double-throw switch. The illustration shows three terminals
(connections) on this switch. The schematic symbol for the switch is also shown.
</p><p class="paragraph">The center connection of the schematic symbol represents the point at which current enters the
switch. The left and right connections represent the two different points to which this current can be
switched. From the schematic symbol, it is easy to determine that this is a single-pole, double-throw
switch.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now look at figure 3-3(B). The switch is shown with its schematic symbol. The schematic symbol
has two points at which current can enter the switch, so this is a double-pole switch. Each of the poles is
mechanically connected (still electrically separate) to one point, so this is a single-throw switch. Only one
throw is required to route two separate circuit paths through the switch.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-3(C) shows a double-pole, double-throw switch and its schematic symbol. Figure 3-3(D)
shows a four-pole, double-throw switch and its schematic symbol.
</p><p class="paragraph">It might help you to think of switches with more than one pole as several switches connected
together mechanically. For example, the knife switch shown in figure 3-3(D) could be thought of as four
single-pole, double-throw switches mechanically connected together.

</p><p class="paragraph">Single-Break and Double-Break Switches
Switches can also be classified as SINGLE-BREAK or DOUBLE-BREAK switches. This refers to
</p><p class="paragraph">the number of places in which the switch opens or breaks the circuit. All of the switches shown so far
have been single-break switches. A double-break switch is shown in figure 3-5. The schematic symbol
shown in figure 3-5(A) shows that this switch breaks the circuit in two places (at both terminals). The
upper part of the schematic symbol indicates that these contacts are in the open position and the circuit
will close when the switch is acted upon (manually or automatically). The lower symbol shows closed
contacts. These contacts will open the circuit when the switch is acted upon.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-5(B) is a picture of the switch. This switch is called a pushbutton switch because it has a
button that must be pushed to change the switch contact connections. Notice that the switch has four
terminals. The schematic symbol in figure 3-5(A) shows that when one set of contacts is open, the other
set of contacts is closed. This switch is a double-pole, single-throw, double-break switch.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The number of poles in a switch is independent of the number of throws and whether it is a single or
double break switch. The number of throws in a switch is independent of the number of poles and
whether it is a single or double break switch. In other words, each characteristic of a switch (poles,
throws, break) is not determined by either of the other characteristics. Figure 3-6 shows the schematic
symbols for several different switch configurations.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Rotary Switches
A rotary switch is a midcontact switch part of the schematic with the contacts arranged in a full or
</h3><p class="paragraph">partial circle. Instead of a pushbutton or toggle, the mechanism used to select the contact moves in a
circular motion and must be turned. Rotary switches can be manual or automatic switches. An automobile
distributor, the ignition switch on a motor vehicle, and the channel selector on some television sets are
rotary switches.
</p><p class="paragraph">The automobile distributor cap and rotor are an example of the simplest form of an automatic rotary
switch. Figure 3-7 shows a portion of an automobile ignition system with the distributor cap and rotor
shown. The rotor is the portion of this switch that moves (rotates) and selects the circuit (spark plug). The
rotor does not actually touch the contacts going to the spark plugs, but the signal (spark) jumps the gap
between the rotor and the contacts. This switch has one input (the rotor) and six positions (one for each
spark plug). The schematic diagram for this rotary switch is shown below the illustration of the distributor
cap.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">3-9
</p><p class="paragraph">The rotor in the distributor rotates continually (when in use) in one direction and makes a complete
circle. This is not true for all rotary switches. The ignition switch in an automobile is also a rotary switch.
It usually has four positions (accessory, off, on, start). Unlike the rotor, it does not rotate continually
when in use, can be turned in either direction, and does not move through a complete circle.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some rotary switches are made with several layers or levels. The arrangement makes possible the
control of several circuits with a single switch. Figure 3-8 is an illustration of a rotary switch with two
layers. Each layer has a selector and 20 contacts. As this switch is rotated, both layers select a single
circuit (contact) of the 20.
</p><p class="paragraph">The channel selector on some television sets is a multilayer rotary switch. It is also called a WAFER
SWITCH. In a wafer switch, each layer is known as a wafer.
</p><p class="paragraph">The schematic of the wafer is always drawn to represent the wafer as it would look if viewed from
opposite the operating handle or mechanism. If the wafer has contacts on both sides, two drawings are
used to show the two sides of the wafer. The two drawings are labeled "front" and "rear." The drawing
labeled "front" represents the side of the wafer closest to the operating mechanism.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-9(A) shows one wafer of a wafer switch and its schematic symbol. Contact 1 is the point at
which current enters the wafer. It is always connected to the movable portion of the wafer. With the wafer
in the position shown, contact 1 is connected to both contact 5 and 6 through the movable portion. If the
movable portion was rotated slightly clockwise, contact 1 would only be connected to contact 5. This
arrangement is known as MAKE BEFORE BREAK because the switch makes a contact before breaking
the old contact.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-9(B) is an illustration of the entire switch and its schematic symbol. Since the switch has
two wafers mechanically connected by the shaft of the switch, the shaft rotates the movable portion of
both wafers at the same time. This is represented on the schematic symbol by the dotted line connecting
the two wafers.
</p><p class="paragraph">The upper wafer of the schematic symbol is the wafer closest to the control mechanism, and is
identical to the wafer shown in figure 3-9(A). When switches have more than one wafer, the first wafer
shown is always the wafer closest to the operating mechanism. The lower wafer on the schematic diagram
is the wafer farthest away from the operating mechanism. Contact 9 of this wafer is connected to the
movable portion and is the point at which current enters the wafer. In the position shown, contact 9 is
connected to both contact 13 and 16. If the switch is rotated slightly clockwise, contact 9 would no longer
be connected to contact 13. A further clockwise movement would connect contact 9 to contact 12. This
arrangement is called BREAK BEFORE MAKE. Contact 9 will also be connected to contact 15 at the
same time as it is connected to contact 12.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OTHER-TYPES-OF-SWITCHES-3-11-">OTHER TYPES OF SWITCHES
</h2><p class="paragraph">You have learned that switches are classified by the number of poles, throws, and breaks. There are
other factors used to describe a switch such as the type of actuator and the number of positions. In
addition, switches are classified by whether the switch has momentary contacts or is locked into or out of
position and whether or not the switch is snap-acting.
Type of Actuator
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to the pushbutton, toggle, and knife actuated switches already described, switches can
have other actuators. There are rocker switches, paddle switches, keyboard switches and mercury
switches (in which a small amount of mercury makes the electrical contact between two conductors).
Number of Positions
</p><p class="paragraph">Switches are also classified by the number of positions of the actuating device. Figure 3-11 shows
three toggle switches, the toggle positions, and schematic diagrams of the switch. Figure 3-11(A) is a
single-pole, single-throw, two-position switch. The switch is marked to indicate the ON position (when
the switch is closed) and the OFF position (when the switch is open). Figure 3-11(B) is a single-pole,
double-throw, three-position switch. The switch markings show two ON positions and an OFF position.
When this switch is OFF, no connection is made between any of the terminals. In either of the ON
positions, the center terminal is connected to one of the outside terminals. (The outside terminals are not
connected together in any position of the switch.) Figure 3-11(C) is a single-pole, double-throw,
two-position switch. There is no OFF position. In either position of this switch, the center terminal is
connected to one of the outside terminals.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Momentary and Locked Position Switches
In some switches, one or more of the switch positions are MOMENTARY.  This means that the
</p><p class="paragraph">switch will only remain in the momentary position as long as the actuator is held in that position. As soon
as you let go of the actuator, the switch will return to a non-momentary position. The starter switch on an
automobile is an example of a momentary switch. As soon as you release the switch, it no longer applies
power to the starter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another type of switch can be LOCKED IN or OUT of some of the switch positions. This locking
prevents the accidental movement of the switch. If a switch has locked-in positions, the switch cannot be
moved from those positions accidentally (by the switch being bumped or mistaken for an unlocked
switch). If the switch has locked-out positions, the switch cannot be moved into those positions
accidentally. Figure 3-12 shows a three-position, locking switch.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Snap-Acting Switches
A SNAP-ACTING switch is a switch in which the movement of the switch mechanism (contacts) is
</h3><p class="paragraph">relatively independent of the activating mechanism movement. In other words, in a toggle switch, no
matter how fast or slow you move the toggle, the actual switching of the circuit takes place at a fixed
speed. The snap-acting switch is constructed by making the switch mechanism a leaf spring so that it
"snaps" between positions. A snap-acting switch will always be in one of the positions designed for that
switch. The switch cannot be "between" positions. A two-position, single-pole, double-throw, snap-acting
switch could not be left in an OFF position.
Accurate Snap-Acting Switches
</p><p class="paragraph">An ACCURATE SNAP-ACTING SWITCH is a snap-acting switch in which the operating point is
pre-set and very accurately known. The operating point is the point at which the plunger causes the switch
to "switch." The accurate snap-acting switch is commonly called a MICROSWITCH. A microswitch is
shown in figure 3-13.
</p><p class="paragraph">The full description of the microswitch shown in figure 3-13 is a two-position, single-pole,

</p><p class="paragraph">SWITCH RATING
Switches are rated according to their electrical characteristics. The rating of a switch is determined
</p><p class="paragraph">by such factors as contact size, contact material, and contact spacing. There are two basic parts to a switch
rating-the current and voltage rating. For example, a switch may be rated at 250 volts dc, 10 amperes.
Some switches have more than one rating. For example, a single switch may be rated at 250 volts dc, 10
amperes; 500 volts ac, 10 amperes; and 28 volts dc, 20 amperes. This rating indicates a current rating that
depends upon the voltage applied.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CURRENT-RATING-OF-A-SWITCH-3-15-">CURRENT RATING OF A SWITCH
</h2><p class="paragraph">The current rating of a switch refers to the maximum current the switch is designed to carry. This
rating is dependent on the voltage of the circuit in which the switch is used. This is shown in the example
given above. The current rating of a switch should never be exceeded. If the current rating of a switch is
exceeded, the contacts may "weld" together making it impossible to open the circuit.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-VOLTAGE-RATING-OF-A-SWITCH-3-15-">VOLTAGE RATING OF A SWITCH
</h2><p class="paragraph">The voltage rating of a switch refers to the maximum voltage allowable in the circuit in which the
switch is used. The voltage rating may be given as an ac voltage, a dc voltage, or both. The voltage rating
of a switch should never be exceeded. If a voltage higher than the voltage rating of the switch is applied
to the switch, the voltage may be able to "jump" the open contacts of the switch. This would make it
impossible to control the circuit in which the switch was used.
</p><p class="question"> Q15. What is the current rating of a switch?

</p><p class="paragraph">MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT OF SWITCHES
Switches are usually a very reliable electrical component. This means, they don’t fail very often.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most switches are designed to operate 100,000 times or more without failure if the voltage and current
ratings are not exceeded. Even so, switches do fail. The following information will help you in

</p><p class="paragraph">As you remember from chapter 1, before the ohmmeter is used, power must be removed from the
circuit and the component being checked should be isolated from the circuit. The best way to isolate the
switch is to remove it from the circuit completely. This is not always practical, and it is sometimes
necessary to check a switch while there is power applied to it. In these cases, you would not be able to use
an ohmmeter to check the switch, but you can check the switch by the use of a voltmeter.

</h2><p class="paragraph">As already mentioned, switches do not fail very often. However, there is a need for preventive
maintenance of switches. Periodically switches should be checked for corrosion at the terminals, smooth
and correct operation, and physical damage. Any problems found should be corrected immediately. Most
switches can be inspected visually for corrosion or damage. The operation of the switch may be checked
by moving the actuator. When the actuator is moved, you can feel whether the switch operation is smooth
or seems to have a great deal of friction. To check the actual switching, you can observe the operation of
the equipment or check the switch with a meter.
</p><p class="question"> Q17. What two types of meters can be used to check a switch?
 Q18. If a switch must be checked with power applied, what type of meter is used?
 Q19. A double-pole, double-throw, single-break, three-position, toggle switch is faulty. This switch has
</p><p class="paragraph">a momentary position 1 and is locked out opposition 3. The voltage and current ratings for the
switch are 115 volt dc, 5 amperes. No direct replacement is available. From switches A through I,
in table 3-1, indicate if the switch is acceptable or not acceptable as a substitute. Of the
acceptable switches, rank them in order of choice. If the switch is unacceptable, give the reason.

</p><h3 class="subsection">SOLENOIDS
A SOLENOID is a control device that uses electromagnetism to convert electrical energy into
</h3><p class="paragraph">mechanical motion. The movement of the solenoid may be used to close a set of electrical contacts, cause
the movement of a mechanical device, or both at the same time.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-17 is a cutaway view of a solenoid showing the solenoid action. A solenoid is an
electromagnet formed by a conductor wound in a series of loops in the shape of a spiral. Inserted within
this coil is a soft-iron core and a movable plunger. The soft-iron core is pinned or held in an immovable
position. The movable plunger (also soft iron) is held away from the core by a spring when the solenoid is
deenergized.
</p><p class="paragraph">When current flows through the conductor, it produces a magnetic field. The magnetic flux produced
by the coil results in establishing north and south poles in both the core and the plunger. The plunger is
attracted along the lines of force to a position at the center of the coil. As shown in figure 3-17, the
deenergized position of the plunger is partially out of the coil due to the action of the spring. When
voltage is applied, the current through the coil produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field draws the
plunger within the coil, resulting in mechanical motion. When the coil is deenergized, the plunger returns
to its normal position because of spring action. The effective strength of the magnetic field on the plunger
varies according to the distance between the plunger and the core. For short distances, the strength of the
field is strong; and as distances increase, the strength of the field drops off quite rapidly.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">While a solenoid is a control device, the solenoid itself is energized by some other control device
such as a switch or a relay. One of the distinct advantages in the use of solenoids is that a mechanical
movement can be accomplished at a considerable distance from the control device. The only link
necessary between the control device and the solenoid is the electrical wiring for the coil current. The
solenoid can have large contacts for the control of high current. Therefore, the solenoid also provides a
means of controlling high current with a low current switch. For example, the ignition switch on an
automobile controls the large current of a starter motor by the use of a solenoid. Figure 3-18 shows a
cutaway view of a starter motor-solenoid combination and a section of the wiring for the solenoid. Notice
that the solenoid provides all electrical contact for current to the starter motor as well as a mechanical
movement of the shift lever.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">If you suspect that a solenoid is not working properly, the first step in troubleshooting it is a good
visual inspection. Check the connections for poor soldering, loose connections, or broken wires. The
plunger should be checked for cleanliness, binding, mechanical failure, and improper alignment. The
mechanism that the solenoid is connected to (actuates) should also be checked for proper operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">The second step is to check the energizing voltage with a voltmeter. If the voltage is too low, the
result is less current flowing through the coil and a weak magnetic field. A weak magnetic field can result
in slow or poor operation. Low voltage could also result in chatter or no operation at all. If the energizing
voltage is too high, it could damage the solenoid by causing overheating or arcing. In either case, the
voltage should be reset to the proper value so that further damage or failure of the solenoid will not result.
</p><p class="paragraph">The solenoid coil should then be checked for opens, shorts, and proper resistance with an ohmmeter.
If the solenoid coil is open, current cannot flow through it and the magnetic field is lost. A short results in
fewer turns and higher current in the coil. The net result of a short is a weak magnetic field. A high-
resistance coil will reduce coil current and also result in a weak magnetic field. A weak magnetic field</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">RELAYS
The RELAY is a device that acts upon the same fundamental principle as the solenoid. The
</p><p class="paragraph">difference between a relay and a solenoid is that a relay does not have a movable core (plunger) while the
solenoid does. Where multipole relays are used, several circuits may be controlled at once.
</p><p class="paragraph">Relays are electrically operated control switches, and are classified according to their use as POWER
RELAYS or CONTROL RELAYS. Power relays are called CONTACTORS; control relays are usually
known simply as relays.
</p><p class="paragraph">The function of a contactor is to use a relatively small amount of electrical power to control the
switching of a large amount of power. The contactor permits you to control power at other locations in the
equipment, and the heavy power cables need be run only through the power relay contacts.
</p><p class="paragraph">Only lightweight control wires are connected from the control switches to the relay coil. Safety is
also an important reason for using power relays, since high power circuits can be switched remotely
without danger to the operator.
</p><p class="paragraph">Control relays, as their name implies, are frequently used in the control of low power circuits or
other relays, although they also have many other uses. In automatic relay circuits, a small electric signal
may set off a chain reaction of successively acting relays, which then perform various functions.
</p><p class="paragraph">In general, a relay consists of a magnetic core and its associated coil, contacts, springs, armature, and
the mounting. Figure 3-19 illustrates the construction of a relay. When the coil is energized, the flow of
current through the coil creates a strong magnetic field which pulls the armature downward to contact C1,
completing the circuit from the common terminal to C1. At the same time, the circuit to contact C2, is
opened.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

known as "break-make" contacts because they break one circuit and make another when the relay is
energized. Figure 3-20 shows five different combinations of relay contacts and the names given to each.
</p><p class="paragraph">A single relay can have several different types of contact combinations. Figure 3-21 is the contact

</p><p class="paragraph">One type of relay with multiple sets of contacts is the clapper relay shown in figure 3-22. As the
circuit is energized, the clapper is pulled to the magnetic coil. This physical movement of the armature of
the clapper forces the pushrod and movable contacts upward. Any number of sets of contacts may be built
onto the relay; thus, it is possible to control many different circuits at the same time. This type of relay
can be a source of trouble because the motion of the clapper armature does not necessarily assure
movement of all the movable contacts. Referring to figure 3-22, if the pushrod were broken, the clapper
armature might push the lower movable contact upward but not move the upper movable contact.

</p><p class="paragraph">Some equipment requires a "warm-up" period between the application of power and some other
action. For example, vacuum tubes (covered later in this training series) require a delay between the
application of filament power and high voltage. A time-delay relay will provide this required delay.
</p><p class="paragraph">A thermal time-delay relay (fig. 3-23) is constructed to produce a delayed action when energized. Its
operation depends on the thermal action of a bimetallic element similar to that used in a thermal circuit
breaker. A heater is mounted around or near the element. The movable contact is mounted on the element
itself. As the heat causes the element to bend (because of the different thermal expansion rates), the
contacts close.
</p><p class="paragraph">Relays can be described by the method of packaging; open, semisealed, and sealed. Figure 3-24
shows several different relays and illustrates these three types of packaging.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The relay is one of the most dependable electromechanical devices in use, but like any other
mechanical or electrical device, relays occasionally wear out or become inoperative. Should an inspection
determine that a relay is defective, the relay should be removed immediately and replaced with another of
the same type. You should be sure to obtain the same type relay as a replacement. Relays are rated in
voltage, amperage, type of service, number of contacts, and similar characteristics.
</p><p class="paragraph">Relay coils usually consist of a single coil. If a relay fails to operate, the coil should be tested for
open circuit, short circuit, or short to ground. An open coil is a common cause of relay failure.
</p><p class="paragraph">During preventive maintenance you should check for charred or burned insulation on the relay and
for darkened or charred terminal leads. Both of these indicate overheating, and the likelihood of relay
breakdown. One possible cause for overheating is that the power terminal connectors are not tight. This
would allow arcing at the connection.
</p><p class="paragraph">The build-up of film on the contact surfaces of a relay is another cause of relay trouble. Although
film will form on the contacts by the action of atmospheric and other gases, grease film is responsible for
a lot of contact trouble. Carbon build-up which is caused by the burning of a grease film or other
substance (during arcing), also can be troublesome. Carbon forms rings on the contact surfaces and as the
carbon rings build-up, the relay contacts are held open.
</p><p class="paragraph">When current flows in one direction through a relay, a problem called "cone and crater" may be
created at the contacts. The crater is formed by transfer of metal from one contact to the other contact, the
deposit being in the shape of a cone. This condition is shown in figure 3-25(A).
</p><p class="paragraph">Some relays are equipped with ball-shaped contacts and, in many applications, this type of contact is
considered superior to a flat surface. Figure 3-25(B) shows a set of ball-shaped contacts. Dust or other
substances are not as readily deposited on a ball-shaped surface. In addition, a ball-shaped contact
penetrates film more easily than a flat contact. When you clean or service ball-shaped relay contacts, be
careful to avoid flattening or otherwise altering the rounded surfaces of the contacts, YOU could damage</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

After the burnishing, tool is used, it should be cleaned with alcohol.

specifications of the relay. When a relay has bent contacts, you should use a point bender (shown in figure

would have to be replaced.
</p><p class="paragraph">Cleanliness must be emphasized in the removal and replacement of covers on semi sealed relays.
The entry of dust or other foreign material can cause poor contact connection. When the relay is installed
in a position where there is a possibility of contact with explosive fumes, extra care should be taken with
the cover gasket. Any damage to, or incorrect seating of the gasket increases the possibility of igniting the

force is applied to the actuator. When the force is removed, the actuator (and switch) will return to a non-
momentary position.
</p><p class="paragraph">A LOCKED POSITION of a switch is used to prevent the accidental movement of the actuator to
or from a specific position.
</p><p class="paragraph">A SNAP-ACTING SWITCH is one in which the movement of the switch contacts is relatively
independent of the actuator movement. This is accomplished by using a leaf spring for the common
contact of the switch.
</p><p class="paragraph">A MICROSWITCH is an accurate snap-acting switch and the operating point is preset and very
accurately known.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The VOLTAGE RATING of a switch is the maximum voltage the switch is designed to control. A
voltage higher than the voltage rating may be able to "jump" the open contacts of the switch.
</p><p class="paragraph">The CURRENT RATING of a switch is the maximum current the switch is designed to carry; it is
dependent on the voltage rating. Any current higher than the current rating may cause the contacts of the
switch to melt and "weld" together.
</p><p class="paragraph">The contacts of a switch can be checked with an ohmmeter if power is removed or with a voltmeter
if power is applied to the switch. To check a switch, the actuator should be checked for smooth and

of the switch should be determined. If a substitute switch must be used to replace a faulty switch, the
substitute must have all of the following:
</p><p class="paragraph">At least the same number of poles, throws, and positions; the same number of breaks and an identical
configuration in regard to momentary and locked positions; and a voltage and current rating equal to or
