</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current

</h2><p class="paragraph">Of the many technical subjects that naval personnel are expected to know, probably the one least
susceptible to change is the theory of wave propagation. The basic principles that enable waves to be
propagated (transmitted) through space are the same today as they were 70 years ago. One would think,
then, that a thorough understanding of these principles is a relatively simple task. For the electrical
engineer or the individual with a natural curiosity for the unknown, it is indeed a simple task. Most
technicians, however, tend to view wave propagation as something complex and confusing, and would
just as soon see this chapter completely disappear from training manuals. This attitude undoubtedly stems
from the fact that wave propagation is an invisible force that cannot be detected by the sense of sight or
touch. Understanding wave propagation requires the use of the imagination to visualize the associated
concepts and how they are used in practical application. This manual was developed to help you visualize</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-2
</p><p class="paragraph">and understand those concepts. Through ample use of illustrations and a step-by-step transition from the
simple to the complex, we will help you develop a better understanding of wave propagation. In this
chapter, we will discuss propagation theory on an introductory level, without going into the technical
details that concern the engineer. However, you must still use thought and imagination to understand the
new ideas and concepts as they are presented.
</p><p class="paragraph">To understand radio wave propagation, you must first learn what wave propagation is and some of
the basic physics or properties that affect propagation. Many of these properties are common everyday
occurrences, with which you are already familiar.
</p><p class="paragraph">WHAT IS PROPAGATION?
</p><p class="paragraph">Early man was quick to recognize the need to communicate beyond the range of the human voice. To
satisfy this need, he developed alternate methods of communication, such as hand gestures, beating on a
hollow log, and smoke signals. Although these methods were effective, they were still greatly limited in
range. Eventually, the range limitations were overcome by the development of courier and postal systems;
but there was then a problem of speed. For centuries the time required for the delivery of a message
depended on the speed of a horse.
</p><p class="paragraph">During the latter part of the 19th century, both distance and time limitations were largely overcome.
The invention of the telegraph made possible instantaneous communication over long wires. Then a short
time later, man discovered how to transmit messages in the form of RADIO WAVES.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you will learn in this chapter, radio waves are propagated. PROPAGATION means "movement
through a medium." This is most easily illustrated by light rays. When a light is turned on in a darkened
room, light rays travel from the light bulb throughout the room. When a flashlight is turned on, light rays
also radiate from its bulb, but are focused into a narrow beam. You can use these examples to picture how
radio waves propagate. Like the light in the room, radio waves may spread out in all directions. They can
also be focused (concentrated) like the flashlight, depending upon the need. Radio waves are a form of
radiant energy, similar to light and heat. Although they can neither be seen nor felt, their presence can be
detected through the use of sensitive measuring devices. The speed at which both forms of waves travel is
the same; they both travel at the speed of light.
</p><p class="paragraph">You may wonder why you can see light but not radio waves, which consist of the same form of
energy as light. The reason is that you can only "see" what your eyes can detect. Your eyes can detect
radiant energy only within a fixed range of frequencies. Since the frequencies of radio waves are below
the frequencies your eyes can detect, you cannot see radio waves.
</p><p class="paragraph">The theory of wave propagation that we discuss in this module applies to Navy electronic equipment,
such as radar, navigation, detection, and communication equipment. We will not discuss these individual
systems in this module, but we will explain them in future modules.

light, hear sound, and feel heat. However, there are some waves that do not stimulate our senses. For</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">example, radio waves, such as those received by our portable radio or television sets, cannot be seen,
heard, or felt. A device must be used to convert radio waves into light (TV pictures) and sound (audio) for
us to sense them.
</p><p class="paragraph">A WAVE can be defined as a DISTURBANCE (sound, light, radio waves) that moves through a
MEDIUM (air, water, vacuum). To help you understand what is meant by "a disturbance which moves
through a medium," picture the following illustration. You are standing in the middle of a wheat field. As
the wind blows across the field toward you, you can see the wheat stalks bending and rising as the force
of the wind moves into and across them. The wheat appears to be moving toward you, but it isn’t. Instead,
the stalks are actually moving back and forth. We can then say that the "medium" in this illustration is the
wheat and the "disturbance" is the wind moving the stalks of wheat.
</p><p class="paragraph">WAVE MOTION can be defined as a recurring disturbance advancing through space with or without
the use of a physical medium. Wave motion, therefore, is a means of moving or transferring energy from
one point to another point. For example, when sound waves strike a microphone, sound energy is
converted into electrical energy. When light waves strike a phototransistor or radio waves strike an
antenna, they are likewise converted into electrical energy. Therefore, sound, light, and radio waves are
all forms of energy that are moved by wave motion. We will discuss sound waves, light waves, and radio
waves later.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A type of wave motion familiar to almost everyone is the movement of waves in water. We will
explain these waves first to help you understand wave motion and the terms used to describe it.
</p><p class="paragraph">Basic wave motion can be shown by dropping a stone into a pool of water (see figure 1-1). As the
stone enters the water, a surface disturbance is created, resulting in an expanding series of circular waves.
Figure 1-2 is a diagram of this action. View A shows the falling stone just an instant before it strikes the
water. View B shows the action taking place at the instant the stone strikes the surface, pushing the water
that is around it upward and outward. In view C, the stone has sunk deeper into the water, which has
closed violently over it causing some spray, while the leading wave has moved outward. An instant later,
the stone has sunk out of sight, leaving the water disturbed as shown in view D. Here the leading wave
has continued to move outward and is followed by a series of waves gradually diminishing in amplitude.
Meanwhile, the disturbance at the original point of contact has gradually subsided.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In this example, the water is not actually being moved outward by the motion of the waves, but up
and down as the waves move outward. The up and down motion is transverse, or at right angles, to the
outward motion of the waves. This type of wave motion is called TRANSVERSE WAVE MOTION.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TRANSVERSE-WAVES-1-5-">TRANSVERSE WAVES
</h2><p class="paragraph">To explain transverse waves, we will again use our example of water waves. Figure 1-3 is a cross
section diagram of waves viewed from the side. Notice that the waves are a succession of crests and
troughs. The wavelength (one 360 degree cycle) is the distance from the crest of one wave to the crest of
the next, or between any two similar points on adjacent waves. The amplitude of a transverse wave is half
the distance measured vertically from the crest to the trough. Water waves are known as transverse waves
because the motion of the water is up and down, or at right angles to the direction in which the waves are
traveling. You can see this by observing a cork bobbing up and down on water as the waves pass by; the
cork moves very little in a sideways direction. In figure 1-4, the small arrows show the up-and-down
direction the cork moves as the transverse wave is set in motion. The direction the wave travels is shown
by the large arrow. Radio waves, light waves, and heat waves are examples of transverse waves.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LONGITUDINAL-WAVES-1-5-">LONGITUDINAL WAVES
</h2><p class="paragraph">In the previous discussion, we listed radio waves, light waves, and heat waves as examples of
transverse waves, but we did not mention sound waves. Why? Simply because sound waves are
LONGITUDINAL WAVES. Unlike transverse waves, which travel at right angles to the direction of
propagation, sound waves travel back and forth in the same direction as the wave motion. Therefore,
longitudinal waves are waves in which the disturbance takes place in the direction of propagation.
Longitudinal waves are sometimes called COMPRESSION WAVES.
</p><p class="paragraph">Waves that make up sound, such as those set up in the air by a vibrating tuning fork, are longitudinal
waves. In figure 1-5, the tuning fork, when struck, sets up vibrations. As the tine moves in an outward
direction, the air immediately in front of it is compressed (made more dense) so that its momentary</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">pressure is raised above that at other points in the surrounding medium (air). Because air is elastic, the
disturbance is transmitted in an outward direction as a COMPRESSION WAVE. When the tine returns
and moves in the inward direction, the air in front of the tine is rarefied (made less dense or expanded) so
that its pressure is lowered below that of the other points in the surrounding air. The rarefied wave is
propagated from the tuning fork and follows the compressed wave through the medium (air).

</h2><p class="paragraph">We have used the term medium in describing the motion of waves. Since medium is a term that is
used frequently in discussing propagation, it needs to be defined so you will understand what a medium is
and its application to propagation.
</p><p class="paragraph">A MEDIUM is the vehicle through which the wave travels from one point to the next. The vehicle
that carries a wave can be just about anything. An example of a medium, already mentioned, is air. Air, as
defined by the dictionary, is the mixture of invisible, odorless, tasteless gases that surrounds the earth (the
atmosphere). Air is made up of molecules of various gases (and impurities). We will call these molecules
of air particles of air or simply particles.

TERMS USED IN WAVE MOTION
</p><p class="paragraph">There are a number of special terms concerning waves that you should know. Many of the terms,
such as CYCLE, WAVELENGTH, AMPLITUDE, and FREQUENCY were introduced in previous
NEETS modules. We will now discuss these terms in detail as they pertain to wave propagation. Before
we begin our discussion, however, note that in the figure, wave 1 and wave 2 have equal frequency and
wavelength but different amplitudes. The REFERENCE LINE (also known as REST POSITION or
POINT OF ZERO DISPLACEMENT) is the position that a particle of matter would have if it were not
disturbed by wave motion. For example, in the case of the water wave, the reference line is the level of
the water when no wave motion is present. With this in mind, let’s go on to our discussion of the four
terms, as shown in figure 1-7.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Cycle
</h3><p class="paragraph">Refer to wave 1 in figure 1-7. Notice how similar it is to the sine wave you have already studied. All
transverse waves appear as sine waves when viewed from the side. In figure 1-7, wave 1 has four
complete cycles. Points ABCDE comprise one complete cycle having a maximum value above and a
maximum value below the reference line. The portion above the reference line (between points A and C)
is called a POSITIVE ALTERNATION and the portion below the reference line (between points C and
E) is known as a NEGATIVE ALTERNATION. The combination of one complete positive and one
complete negative alternation represents one cycle of the wave. At point E, the wave begins to repeat
itself with a second cycle completed at point I, a third at point M, etc. The peak of the positive alternation
(maximum value above the line) is sometimes referred to as the TOP or CREST, and the peak of the
negative alternation (maximum value below the line) is sometimes called the BOTTOM or TROUGH, as
depicted in the figure. Therefore, one cycle has one crest and one trough.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Wavelength
</h3><p class="paragraph">A WAVELENGTH is the distance in space occupied by one cycle of a radio wave at any given
instant. If the wave could be frozen in place and measured, the wavelength would be the distance from the
leading edge of one cycle to the corresponding point on the next cycle. Wavelengths vary from a few
hundredths of an inch at extremely high frequencies to many miles at extremely low frequencies;
however, common practice is to express wavelengths in meters. Therefore, in figure 1-7 (wave 1), the

of waves.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Amplitude
</h3><p class="paragraph">Two waves may have the same wavelength, but the crest of one may rise higher above the reference
line than the crest of the other. Compare wave 1 and wave 2 of figure 1-7 again. The height of a wave
crest above the reference line is called the AMPLITUDE of the wave. The amplitude of a wave gives a
relative indication of the amount of energy the wave transmits. A continuous series of waves, such as A
through Q, having the same amplitude and wavelength, is called a train of waves or WAVE TRAIN.
Frequency and Time
</p><p class="paragraph">Time is an important factor in wave studies. When a wave train passes through a medium, a certain
number of individual waves pass a given point in a specific unit of time. For example, if a cork on a water
wave rises and falls once every second, the wave makes one complete up-and-down vibration every
second. The number of vibrations, or cycles, of a wave train in a unit of time is called the FREQUENCY
of the wave train and is measured in HERTZ. If 5 waves pass a point in one second, the frequency of the
wave train is 5 cycles per second. In figure 1-7, the frequency of both wave 1 and wave 2 is four cycles
per second (cycles per second is abbreviated as cps).
</p><p class="paragraph">In 1967, in honor of the German physicist Heinrich Hertz, the term HERTZ was designated for use
in lieu of the term "cycle per second" when referring to the frequency of radio waves. It may seem
confusing that in one place the term "cycle" is used to designate the positive and negative alternations of a
wave, but in another instance the term "hertz" is used to designate what appears to be the same thing. The
key is the time factor. The term cycle refers to any sequence of events, such as the positive and negative
alternations, comprising one cycle of electrical current. The term hertz refers to the number of
occurrences that take place in one second.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The two types of wave motion, transverse and longitudinal, have many of the same characteristics,
such as frequency, amplitude, and wavelength. Another important characteristic that these two types of
wave motion share is VELOCITY. Velocity of propagation is the rate at which the disturbance travels
through the medium, or the velocity with which the crest of the wave moves along. The velocity of the
wave depends both on the type of wave (light, sound, or radio) and type of medium (air, water, or metal).
If longitudinal waves are plotted as a graph, they appear as transverse waves. This fact is illustrated in
figure 1-8.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

cycles the wave makes during a specific unit of time. The higher the frequency, the greater is the number
of compressions and expansions per unit of time.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the two types of wave motion described in the preceding discussion, the following quantities are
of interest:

the frequency (expressed in cycles per second, or Hz), the wavelength is given in feet per cycle. If the
metric system is used and the velocity (expressed in meters per second) is divided by the frequency
(expressed in cycles per second), the wavelength is given in meters per cycle. Be sure to express both the
wavelength and the frequency in the same units. (Feet per cycle and meters per cycle are normally
abbreviated as feet or meters because one wavelength indicates one cycle.) Because this equation holds
true for both transverse and longitudinal waves, it is used in the study of both electromagnetic waves and
sound waves.

</p><p class="paragraph">Other important characteristics of wave motion are reflection, refraction, diffraction, and the Doppler
effect. Big words, but the concept of each is easy to see. For ease of understanding, we will explain the
first two characteristics using light waves, and the last two characteristics using sound waves. You should
keep in mind that all waves react in a similar manner.
</p><p class="paragraph">Within mediums, such as air, solids, or gases, a wave travels in a straight line. When the wave leaves
the boundary of one medium and enters the boundary of a different medium, the wave changes direction.
For our purposes in this module, a boundary is an imaginary line that separates one medium from another.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a wave passes through one medium and encounters a medium having different characteristics,
three things can occur to the wave: (1) Some of the energy can be reflected back into the initial medium;
(2) some of the energy can be transmitted into the second medium where it may continue at a different
velocity; or (3) some of the energy can be absorbed by the medium. In some cases, all three processes
(reflection, transmission, and absorption) may occur to some degree.
Reflection
</p><p class="paragraph">REFLECTION WAVES are simply waves that are neither transmitted nor absorbed, but are reflected
from the surface of the medium they encounter. If a wave is directed against a reflecting surface, such as a
mirror, it will reflect or "bounce" from the mirror. Refer to figure 1-9. A wave directed toward the surface
of the mirror is called the INCIDENT wave. When the wave bounces off of the mirror, it becomes known
as the REFLECTED wave. An imaginary line perpendicular to the mirror at the point at which the
incident wave strikes the mirror’s surface is called the NORMAL, or perpendicular. The angle between
the incident wave and the normal is called the ANGLE OF INCIDENCE. The angle between the reflected
wave and the normal is called the ANGLE OF REFLECTION.

</p><p class="paragraph">If the reflecting surface is smooth and polished, the angle between the incident ray and the normal
will be the same as the angle between the reflected ray and the normal. This conforms to the law of
reflection which states: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of incident wave energy reflected from a given surface depends on the nature of the
surface and the angle at which the wave strikes the surface. As the angle of incidence increases, the
amount of wave energy reflected increases. The reflected energy is the greatest when the wave is nearly
parallel to the reflecting surface. When the incident wave is perpendicular to the surface, more of the
energy is transmitted into the substance and less is reflected. At any incident angle, a mirror reflects
almost all of the wave energy, while a dull, black surface reflects very little.

 Q12. When a wave is reflected from a surface, energy is transferred. When is the transfer of energy
</p><p class="paragraph">greatest?
</p><p class="question"> Q13. When is the transfer of energy minimum?
Refraction
</p><p class="paragraph">When a wave passes from one medium into another medium that has a different velocity of
propagation, a change in the direction of the wave will occur. This changing of direction as the wave
enters the second medium is called REFRACTION. As in the discussion of reflection, the wave striking
the boundary (surface) is called the INCIDENT WAVE, and the imaginary line perpendicular to the
boundary is called the NORMAL. The angle between the incident wave and the normal is called the
ANGLE OF INCIDENCE. As the wave passes through the boundary, it is bent either toward or away
from the normal. The angle between the normal and the path of the wave through the second medium is
the ANGLE OF REFRACTION.
</p><p class="paragraph">A light wave passing through a block of glass is shown in figure 1-10. The wave moves from point A
to B at a constant speed. This is the incident wave. As the wave penetrates the glass boundary at point B,
the velocity of the wave is slowed down. This causes the wave to bend toward the normal. The wave then
takes the path from point B to C through the glass and becomes BOTH the refracted wave from the top
surface and the incident wave to the lower surface. As the wave passes from the glass to the air (the
second boundary), it is again refracted, this time away from the normal and takes the path from point C to
D. As the wave passes through the last boundary, its velocity increases to the original velocity. As figure
1-10 shows, refracted waves can bend toward or away from the normal. This bending depends on the
velocity of the wave through each medium. The broken line between points B and E is the path that the
wave would travel if the two mediums (air and glass) had the same density.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">To summarize what figure 1-10 shows:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. If the wave passes from a less dense medium to a more dense medium, it is bent toward the
normal, and the angle of refraction (r) is less than the angle of incidence (i).
</p><p class="paragraph">2. If the wave passes from a more dense to a less dense medium, it is bent away from the normal,
and the angle of refraction (r1) is greater than the angle of incidence (i1).
</p><p class="paragraph">You can more easily understand refraction by looking at figure 1-11. There is a plowed field in the
middle of a parade ground. Think of the incident wave as a company of recruits marching four abreast at
an angle across the parade ground to the plowed field, then crossing the plowed field and coming out on
the other side onto the parade ground again. As the recruits march diagonally across the parade ground
and begin to cross the boundary onto the plowed field, the front line is slowed down. Because the recruits
arrive at the boundary at different times, they will begin to slow down at different times (number 1 slows
down first and number 4 slows down last in each line). The net effect is a bending action. When the
recruits leave the plowed field and reenter the parade ground, the reverse action takes place.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="question"> Q14. A refracted wave occurs when a wave passes from one medium into another medium. What
determines the angle of refraction?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Diffraction
</h3><p class="paragraph">DIFFRACTION is the bending of the wave path when the waves meet an obstruction. The amount of
diffraction depends on the wavelength of the wave. Higher frequency waves are rarely diffracted in the
normal world that surrounds us. Since light waves are high frequency waves, you will rarely see light
diffracted. You can, however, observe diffraction in sound waves by listening to music. Suppose you are
outdoors listening to a band. If you step behind a solid obstruction, such as a brick wall, you will hear
mostly low notes. This is because the higher notes, having short wave lengths, undergo little or no
diffraction and pass by or over the wall without wrapping around the wall and reaching your ears. The
low notes, having longer wavelengths, wrap around the wall and reach your ears. This leads to the general
statement that lower frequency waves tend to diffract more than higher frequency waves. Broadcast band
(AM band) radio waves (lower frequency waves) often travel over a mountain to the opposite side from
their source because of diffraction, while higher frequency TV and FM signals from the same source tend
to be stopped by the mountain.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Doppler Effect
</h3><p class="paragraph">The last, but equally important, characteristic of a wave that we will discuss is the Doppler effect.
The DOPPLER EFFECT is the apparent change in frequency or pitch when a sound source moves either
toward or away from the listener, or when the listener moves either toward or away from the sound
source. This principle, discovered by the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, applies to all wave motion.
</p><p class="paragraph">The apparent change in frequency between the source of a wave and the receiver of the wave is
because of relative motion between the source and the receiver. To understand the Doppler effect, first
assume that the frequency of a sound from a source is held constant. The wavelength of the sound will
also remain constant. If both the source and the receiver of the sound remain stationary, the receiver will</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">hear the same frequency sound produced by the source. This is because the receiver is receiving the same
number of waves per second that the source is producing. Now, if either the source or the receiver or both
move toward the other, the receiver will perceive a higher frequency sound. This is because the receiver
will receive a greater number of sound waves per second and interpret the greater number of waves as a
higher frequency sound. Conversely, if the source and the receiver are moving apart, the receiver will
receive a smaller number of sound waves per second and will perceive a lower frequency sound. In both
cases, the frequency of the sound produced by the source will have remained constant.
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, the frequency of the whistle on a fast-moving train sounds increasingly higher in pitch
as the train is approaching than when the train is departing. Although the whistle is generating sound
waves of a constant frequency, and though they travel through the air at the same velocity in all
directions, the distance between the approaching train and the listener is decreasing. As a result, each
wave has less distance to travel to reach the observer than the wave preceding it. Thus, the waves arrive
with decreasing intervals of time between them.
</p><p class="paragraph">These apparent changes in frequency, called the Doppler effect, affect the operation of equipment
used to detect and measure wave energy. In dealing with electromagnetic wave propagation, the Doppler
principle is used in equipment such as radar, target detection, weapons control, navigation, and sonar.
</p><p class="question"> Q15. The apparent change in frequency or pitch because of motion is explained by what effect?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SOUND-WAVES-1-17-">SOUND WAVES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The study of sound is important because of the role sound plays in the depth finding equipment
(fathometer) and underwater detection equipment (sonar) used by the Navy.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you know, sound travels through a medium by wave motion. Although sound waves and the
electromagnetic waves used in the propagation of radio and radar differ, both types of waves have many
of the same characteristics. Studying the principles of sound-wave motion will help you understand the
actions of both sound waves and the more complex radio and radar electromagnetic waves. The major
differences among sound waves, heat waves, and light waves are (1) their frequencies; (2) their types; the
mediums through which they travel; and the velocities at which they travel.
</p><p class="paragraph">SOUND—WHAT IS IT?
</p><p class="paragraph">The word SOUND is used in everyday speech to signify a variety of things. One definition of sound
is the sensation of hearing. Another definition refers to a stimulus that is capable of producing the
sensation of hearing. A third definition limits sound to what is actually heard by the human ear.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the study of physics, sound is defined as a range of compression-wave frequencies to which the
human ear is sensitive. For the purpose of this chapter, however, we need to broaden the definition of
sound to include compression waves that are not always audible to the human ear. To distinguish
frequencies in the audible range from those outside that range, the words SONIC, ULTRASONIC, and
INFRASONIC are used. Sounds capable of being heard by the human ear are called SONICS. The normal
hearing range extends from about 20 to 20,000 hertz. However, to establish a standard sonic range, the
Navy has set an arbitrary upper limit for sonics at 10,000 hertz and a lower limit at 15 hertz. Even though
the average person can hear sounds above 10,000 hertz, it is standard practice to refer to sounds above
that frequency as ultrasonic. Sounds between 15 hertz and 10,000 hertz are called sonic, while sounds
below 15 hertz are known as infrasonic (formerly referred to as subsonic) sounds.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="question"> Q16. What term describes sounds capable of being heard by the human ear?
 Q17. Are all sounds audible to the human ear? Why?
</p><p class="paragraph">REQUIREMENTS FOR SOUND
Recall that sound waves are compression waves. The existence of compression waves depends on
</p><p class="paragraph">the transfer of energy. To produce vibrations that become sounds, a mechanical device (the source) must
first receive an input of energy. Next, the device must be in contact with a medium that will receive the
sound energy and carry it to a receiver. If the device is not in contact with a medium, the energy will not
be transferred to a receiver, and there will be no sound.
</p><p class="paragraph">Thus, three basic elements for transmission and reception of sound must be present before a sound
can be produced. They are (1) the source (or transmitter), (2) a medium for carrying the sound (air, water,
metal, etc.), and (3) the detector (or receiver).
</p><p class="paragraph">A simple experiment provides convincing evidence that a medium must be present if sound is to be
transferred. In figure 1-12, an electric bell is suspended by rubber bands in a bell jar from which the air
can be removed. An external switch is connected from a battery to the bell so the bell may be rung
intermittently. As the air is pumped out, the sound from the bell becomes weaker and weaker. If a perfect
vacuum could be obtained, and if no sound were conducted out of the jar by the rubber bands, the sound
from the bell would be completely inaudible. In other words, sound cannot be transmitted through a
vacuum. When the air is admitted again, the sound is as loud as it was at the beginning. This experiment
shows that when air is in contact with the vibrating bell, it carries energy to the walls of the jar, which in
turn are set in vibration. Thus, the energy passes into the air outside of the jar and then on to the ear of the
observer. This experiment illustrates that sound cannot exist in empty space (or a vacuum).
</p><p class="paragraph">Any object that moves rapidly back and forth, or vibrates, and thus disturbs the medium around it
may be considered a source for sound. Bells, speakers, and stringed instruments are familiar sound
sources.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The material through which sound waves travel is called the medium. The density of the medium
determines the ease, distance, and speed of sound transmission. The higher the density of the medium, the
slower sound travels through it.
</p><p class="paragraph">The detector acts as the receiver of the sound wave. Because it does not surround the source of the
sound wave, the detector absorbs only part of the energy from the wave and sometimes requires an
amplifier to boost the weak signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">As an illustration of what happens if one of these three elements is not present, let’s refer to our
experiment in which a bell was placed in a jar containing a vacuum. You could see the bell being struck,
but you could hear no sound because there was no medium to transmit sound from the bell to you. Now
let’s look at another example in which the third element, the detector, is missing. You see a source (such
as an explosion) apparently producing a sound, and you know the medium (air) is present, but you are too
far away to hear the noise. Thus, as far as you are concerned, there is no detector and, therefore, no sound.
We must assume, then, that sound can exist only when a source transmits sound through a medium, which
passes it to a detector. Therefore, in the absence of any one of the basic elements (source, medium,
detector) there can be NO sound.
</p><p class="question"> Q18. Sound waves transmitted from a source are sometimes weak when they reach the detector. What
instrument is needed to boost the weak signal?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TERMS-USED-IN-SOUND-WAVES-1-19-">TERMS USED IN SOUND WAVES
</h2><p class="paragraph">Sound waves vary in length according to their frequency. A sound having a long wavelength is heard
at a low pitch (low frequency); one with a short wavelength is heard at a high pitch (high frequency). A
complete wavelength is called a cycle. The distance from one point on a wave to the corresponding point
on the next wave is a wavelength. The number of cycles per second (hertz) is the frequency of the sound.
The frequency of a sound wave is also the number of vibrations per second produced by the sound source.
</p><p class="question"> Q19. What are the three basic requirements for sound?
CHARACTERISTICS OF SOUND
</p><p class="paragraph">Sound waves travel at great distances in a very short time, but as the distance increases the waves
tend to spread out. As the sound waves spread out, their energy simultaneously spreads through an
increasingly larger area. Thus, the wave energy becomes weaker as the distance from the source is
increased.
</p><p class="paragraph">Sounds may be broadly classified into two general groups. One group is NOISE, which includes
sounds such as the pounding of a hammer or the slamming of a door. The other group is musical sounds,
or TONES. The distinction between noise and tone is based on the regularity of the vibrations, the degree
of damping, and the ability of the ear to recognize components having a musical sequence. You can best
understand the physical difference between these kinds of sound by comparing the waveshape of a
musical note, depicted in view A of figure 1-13, with the waveshape of noise, shown in view B. You can
see by the comparison of the two waveshapes, that noise makes a very irregular and haphazard curve and
a musical note makes a uniform and regular curve.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-20
</p><p class="paragraph">Sound has three basic characteristics: pitch, intensity, and quality. Each of these three characteristics
is associated with one of the properties of the source or the type of waves which it produces. The pitch
depends upon the frequency of the waves; the intensity depends upon the amplitude of the waves; and the
quality depends upon the form of the waves. With the proper combination of these characteristics, the
tone is pleasant to the ear. With the wrong combination, the sound quality turns into noise.
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Pitch of Sound
</h3><p class="paragraph">The term PITCH is used to describe the frequency of a sound. An object that vibrates many times per
second produces a sound with a high pitch, as with a police whistle. The slow vibrations of the heavier
strings of a violin cause a low-pitched sound. Thus, the frequency of the wave determines pitch. When the
frequency is low, sound waves are long; when it is high, the waves are short. A sound can be so high in
frequency that the waves reaching the ear cannot be heard. Likewise, some frequencies are so low that the
eardrums do not convert them into sound. The range of sound that the human ear can detect varies with
each individual.
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Intensity of Sound
</h3><p class="paragraph">The intensity of sound, at a given distance, depends upon the amplitude of the waves. Thus, a tuning
fork gives out more energy in the form of sound when struck hard than when struck gently. You should
remember that when a tuning fork is struck, the sound is omnidirectional (heard in all directions), because
the sound waves spread out in all directions, as shown in figure 1-14. You can see from the figure that as
the distance between the waves and the sound source increases, the energy in each wave spreads over a
greater area; hence, the intensity of the sound decreases. The speaking tubes sometimes used aboard a
ship prevent the sound waves from spreading in all directions by concentrating them in one desired
direction (unidirectional), producing greater intensity. Therefore, the sound is heard almost at its original
intensity at the opposite end of the speaking tube. The unidirectional megaphone and the directional
loudspeaker also prevent sound waves from spreading in all directions.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Sound intensity and loudness are often mistakenly interpreted as having the same meaning. Although
they are related, they are not the same. Sound INTENSITY is a measure of the sound energy of a wave.
LOUDNESS, on the other hand, is the sensation the intensity (and sometimes frequency) the sound wave
produces on the ear. Increasing the intensity causes an increase in loudness but not in a direct proportion.
For instance, doubling the loudness of a sound requires about a tenfold increase in the intensity of the
sound.
</p><p class="paragraph">Sound Quality
Most sounds, including musical notes, are not pure tones. They are a mixture of different frequencies
</p><p class="paragraph">(tones). A tuning fork, when struck, produces a pure tone of a specific frequency. This pure tone is
produced by regular vibrations of the source (tines of the tuning fork). On the other hand, scraping your
fingernails across a blackboard only creates noise, because the vibrations are irregular. Each individual
pipe of a pipe organ is similar to a tuning fork, and each pipe produces a tone of a specific frequency. But
sounding two or more pipes at the same time produces a complex waveform. A tone that closely imitates
any of the vowel sounds can be produced by selecting the proper pipes and sounding them at the same
time. Figure 1-15 illustrates the combining of two pure tones to make a COMPLEX WAVE.
</p><p class="paragraph">The QUALITY of a sound depends on the complexity of its sound waves, such as the waves shown
in tone C of figure 1-15. Almost all sounds (musical and vocal included) have complicated (complex)</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

organ, or other musical instrument. Tone B is also a simple wave but at a different frequency. When the
two tones are sounded together, the complex waveform in tone C is produced. Note that tone C has the
same frequency as tone A with an increase in amplitude. The human ear could easily distinguish between
tone A and tone C because of the quality. Therefore, we can say that quality distinguishes tones of like
pitch and loudness when sounded on different types of musical instruments. It also distinguishes the
voices of different persons.

</p><p class="paragraph">Sound waves travel through any medium to a velocity that is controlled by the medium. Varying the
frequency and intensity of the sound waves will not affect the speed of propagation. The ELASTICITY
and DENSITY of a medium are the two basic physical properties that govern the velocity of sound
through the medium.
</p><p class="paragraph">Elasticity is the ability of a strained body to recover its shape after deformation, as from a vibration
or compression. The measure of elasticity of a body is the force it exerts to return to its original shape.
</p><p class="paragraph">The density of a medium or substance is the mass per unit volume of the medium or substance.
Raising the temperature of the medium (which decreases its density) has the effect of increasing the
velocity of sound through the medium.
</p><p class="paragraph">The velocity of sound in an elastic medium is expressed by the formula:
</p><p class="paragraph">Even though solids such as steel and glass are far more dense than air, their elasticity’s are so much
greater that the velocities of sound in them are 15 times greater than the velocity of sound in air. Using
elasticity as a rough indication of the speed of sound in a given medium, we can state as a general rule
that sound travels faster in harder materials (such as steel), slower in liquids, and slowest in gases.
Density has the opposite effect on the velocity of sound, that is, with other factors constant, a denser
material (such as lead) passes sound slower.
</p><p class="paragraph">At a given temperature and atmospheric pressure, all sound waves travel in air at the same speed.
Thus the velocity that sound will travel through air at 32º F (0º C) is 1,087 feet per second. But for
practical purposes, the speed of sound in air may be considered as 1,100 feet per second. Table 1-1 gives
a comparison of the velocity of sound in various mediums.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

ACOUSTICS
</p><p class="paragraph">The science of sound is called ACOUSTICS. This subject could fill volumes of technical books, but
we will only scratch the surface in this chapter. We will present important points that you will need for a
better understanding of sound waves.
</p><p class="paragraph">Acoustics, like sound, relates to the sense of hearing. It also deals with the production, control,
transmission, reception, and the effects of sound. For the present, we are concerned only with the last
relationship—the effects of sound. These same effects will be used throughout your study of wave
propagation.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Echo
</h3><p class="paragraph">An ECHO is the reflection of the original sound wave as it bounces off a distant surface. Just as a
rubber ball bounces back when it is thrown against a hard surface, sound waves also bounce off most
surfaces. As you have learned from the study of the law of conservation of energy, a rubber ball never
bounces back with as much energy as the initial bounce. Similarly, a reflected sound wave is not as loud
as the original sound wave. In both cases, some of the energy is absorbed by the reflecting surface. Only a
portion of the original sound is reflected, and only a portion of the reflected sound returns to the listener.
For this reason, an echo is never as loud as the original sound.
</p><p class="paragraph">Sound reflections (echoes) have many applications in the Navy. The most important of these
applications can be found in the use of depth finding equipment (the fathometer) and sonar. The
fathometer sends sound-wave pulses from the bottom of the ship and receives echoes from the ocean floor
to indicate the depth of the ocean beneath the ship. The sonar transmits a pulse of sound energy and
receives the echo to indicate range and bearing of objects or targets in the ocean depths.
Refraction
</p><p class="paragraph">When sound waves traveling at different velocities pass obliquely (at an angle) from one medium
into another, the waves are refracted; that is, their line of travel is bent. Refraction occurs gradually when
one part of a sound wave is traveling faster than the other parts. For example, the wind a few feet above</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-24
</p><p class="paragraph">the surface of the earth has a greater velocity than that near the surface because friction retards the lower
layers (see figure 1-16). The velocity of the wind is added to the velocity of the sound through the air. The
result is that the upper portion of the sound wave moves faster than the lower portion and causes a gradual
change in the direction of travel of the wave. Refraction causes sound to travel farther with the wind than
against it.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Reverberation
</h3><p class="paragraph">In empty rooms or other confined spaces, sound may be reflected several times to cause what is
known as reverberation. REVERBERATION is the multiple reflections of sound waves. Reverberations
seem to prolong the time during which a sound is heard. Examples of this often occur in nature. For
instance, the discharge of lightning causes a sharp, quick sound. By the time this sound has reached the
ears of a distant observer, it is usually drawn out into a prolonged roar by reverberations that we call
thunder. A similar case often arises with underwater sound equipment. Reverberations from nearby points
may continue for such a long time that they interfere with the returning echoes from targets.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Interference
</h3><p class="paragraph">Any disturbance, man-made or natural, that causes an undesirable response or the degradation of a
wave is referred to as INTERFERENCE.
</p><p class="paragraph">Two sound waves moving simultaneously through the same medium will advance independently,
each producing a disturbance as if the other were not present. If the two waves have the same
frequency—in phase with each other—and are moving in the same direction, they are additive and are
said to interfere constructively. If the two waves have the same frequency and are moving in the same
direction, but out of phase with each other, they are subtractive and are said to interfere destructively. If
these two subtractive waves have equal amplitudes, the waves cancel each other. This addition or
subtraction of waves is often called interference.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Resonance
</h3><p class="paragraph">At some time during your life you probably observed someone putting his or her head into an empty
barrel or other cavity and making noises varying in pitch. When that person's voice reached a certain
pitch, the tone produced seemed much louder than the others. The reason for this phenomenon is that at
that a certain pitch the frequency of vibrations of the voice matched the resonant (or natural) frequency of
the cavity. The resonant frequency of a cavity is the frequency at which the cavity body will begin to
vibrate and create sound waves. When the resonant frequency of the cavity was reached, the sound of the
voice was reinforced by the sound waves created by the cavity, resulting in a louder tone.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">This phenomenon occurs whenever the frequency of vibrations is the same as the natural frequency
of a cavity, and is called RESONANCE.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Noise
</h3><p class="paragraph">The most complex sound wave that can be produced is noise. Noise has no tonal quality. It distracts
and distorts the sound quality that was intended to be heard. NOISE is generally an unwanted disturbance
caused by spurious waves originating from man-made or natural sources, such as a jet breaking the sound
barrier, or thunder.

to the other—from low-frequency radio waves to high-frequency X-rays and cosmic rays. Visible light is
a small but very important part of this electromagnetic spectrum.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most of the important terms that pertain to the behavior of waves, such as reflection, refraction,
diffraction, etc., were discussed earlier in this chapter. We will now discuss how these terms are used in
understanding light and light waves. The relationship between light and light waves (rays) is the same as
sound and sound waves.
</p><p class="paragraph">Light is a form of energy. It can be produced by various means (mechanical, electrical, chemical,
etc.). We can see objects because the light rays they give off or reflect reach our eyes. If the object is the
source of light energy, it is called luminous. If the object is not the source of light but reflects light, it is
called an illuminated body.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PROPAGATION-OF-LIGHT-1-25-">PROPAGATION OF LIGHT
</h2><p class="paragraph">The exact nature of light is not fully understood, although scientists have been studying the subject
for many centuries. Some experiments seem to show that light is composed of tiny particles, and some
suggest that it is made up of waves.
</p><p class="paragraph">One theory after another attracted the approval and acceptance of physicists. Today, some scientific
phenomena can be explained only by the wave theory and others only by the particle theory. Physicists,
constantly searching for some new discovery that would bring these two theories into agreement,
gradually have come to accept a theory that combines the principles of the two theories.
</p><p class="paragraph">According to the view now generally accepted, light is a form of electromagnetic radiation; that is,
light and similar forms of radiation are made up of moving electric and magnetic fields. These two fields
will be explained thoroughly later in this chapter.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">James Clark Maxwell, a brilliant Scottish scientist Of the middle l9th century, showed, by
constructing an oscillating electrical circuit, that electromagnetic waves could move through empty space.
Light eventually was proved to be electromagnetic.
</p><p class="paragraph">Current light theory says that light is made up of very small packets of electromagnetic energy called
PHOTONS (the smallest unit of radiant energy). These photons move at a constant speed in the medium
through which they travel. Photons move at a faster speed through a vacuum than they do in the
atmosphere, and at a slower speed through water than air.
</p><p class="paragraph">The electromagnetic energy of light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Light and similar forms
of radiation are made up of moving electric and magnetic forces and move as waves. Electromagnetic
waves move in a manner similar to the waves produced by the pebble dropped in the pool of water
discussed earlier in this chapter. The transverse waves of light from a light source spread out in expanding
circles much like the waves in the pool. However, the waves in the pool are very slow and clumsy in
comparison with light, which travels approximately 186,000 miles per second.
</p><p class="paragraph">Light radiates from its source in all directions until absorbed or diverted by some substance (fig.
1-17). The lines drawn from the light source (a light bulb in this instance) to any point on one of these
waves indicate the direction in which the waves are moving. These lines, called radii of the spheres, are
formed by the waves and are called LIGHT RAYS.
</p><p class="paragraph">Although single rays of light do not exist, light "rays" as used in illustrations are a convenient
method used to show the direction in which light is traveling at any point.
</p><p class="paragraph">A large volume of light is called a beam; a narrow beam is called a pencil; and the smallest portion
of a pencil is called a light ray. A ray of light, can be illustrated as a straight line. This straight line drawn
from a light source will represent an infinite number of rays radiating in all directions from the source.

Compared to sound waves, the frequency of light waves is very high and the wavelength is very

angstroms. One angstrom equals 1055-10m.
</p><p class="question"> Q33. What unit is used to measure the different wavelengths of light?
FREQUENCIES AND COLOR
</p><p class="paragraph">For our discussion of light wave waves, we will use the millimicron measurement. The wavelength
of a light determines the color of the light. Figure 1-18 indicates that light with a wavelength of 700
millimicrons is red, and that light with a wavelength of 500 millimicrons is blue-green. This illustration
shows approximate wavelengths of the different colors in the visible spectrum. In actual fact, the color of
light depends on its frequency, not its wavelength. However, light is measured in wavelengths.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the wavelength of 700 millimicrons is measured in a medium such as air, it produces the color
red, but the same wave measured in a different medium will have a different wavelength. When red light
which has been traveling in air enters glass, it loses speed. Its wavelength becomes shorter or compressed,
but it continues to be red. This illustrates that the color of light depends on frequency and not on
wavelength. The color scale in figure 1-18 is based on the wavelengths in air.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a beam of white light (sunlight) is passed through a PRISM, as shown in figure 1-18, it is
refracted and dispersed (the phenomenon is known as DISPERSION) into its component wavelengths.
Each of these wavelengths causes a different reaction of the eye, which sees the various colors that
compose the visible spectrum. The visible spectrum is recorded as a mixture of red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, and violet. White light results when the PRIMARIES (red, green, and blue) are mixed</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">together in overlapping beams of light. (NOTE: These are not the primaries used in mixing pigments,
such as in paint.) Furthermore, the COMPLEMENTARY or SECONDARY colors (magenta, yellow, and
cyan) may be shown with equal ease by mixing any two of the primary colors in overlapping beams of
light. Thus, red and green light mixed in equal intensities will make yellow light; green and blue will
produce cyan (blue-green light); and blue and red correctly mixed will produce magenta (a purplish red
light).
LIGHT AND COLOR
</p><p class="paragraph">All objects absorb some of the light that falls on them. An object appears to be a certain color
because it absorbs all of the light waves except those whose frequency corresponds to that particular
color. Those waves are reflected from the surface, strike your eye, and cause you to see the particular
color. The color of an object therefore depends on the frequency of the electromagnetic wave reflected.
LUMINOUS BODIES
</p><p class="paragraph">Certain bodies, such as the sun, a gas flame, and an electric light filament, are visible because they
are light sources. They are called SELF-LUMINOUS bodies. Objects other than self-luminous bodies
become visible only when they are in the presence of light from luminous bodies.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most NONLUMINOUS bodies are visible because they diffuse or reflect the light that falls on them.
A good example of a nonluminous diffusing body is the moon, which shines only because the sunlight
falling onto its surface is diffused.
</p><p class="paragraph">Black objects do not diffuse or reflect light. They are visible only when outlined against a
background of light from a luminous or diffusing body.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PROPERTIES-OF-LIGHT-1-28-">PROPERTIES OF LIGHT
</h2><p class="paragraph">When light waves, which travel in straight lines, encounter any substance, they are either
transmitted, refracted, reflected, or absorbed. This is illustrated in figure 1-19. When light strikes a
substance, some absorption and some reflection always take place. No substance completely transmits,
reflects, or absorbs all of the light rays that reach its surface. Substances that transmit almost all the light
waves that fall upon them are said to be TRANSPARENT. A transparent substance is one through which
you can see clearly. Clear glass is transparent because it transmits light rays without diffusing them (view
A of figure 1-20). There is no known perfectly transparent substance, but many substances are nearly so.
Substances through which some light rays can pass but through which objects cannot be seen clearly
because the rays are diffused are called TRANSLUCENT (view B of figure 1-20). The frosted glass of a
light bulb and a piece of oiled paper are examples of translucent materials. Substances that do not transmit
any light rays are called OPAQUE (view C of figure 1-20). Opaque substances can either reflect or absorb
all of the light rays that fall upon them.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Speed of Light
</p><p class="paragraph">You probably have heard people say, "quick as lightning" or "fast as light" to describe rapid motion;
nevertheless, it is difficult to realize how fast light actually travels. Not until recent years have scientists
been able to measure accurately the speed of light.
</p><p class="paragraph">Prior to the middle 17th century, scientists thought that light required no time at all to pass from the
source to the observer. Then in 1675, Ole Roemer, a Danish astronomer, discovered that light travels
approximately 186,000 miles per second in space. At this velocity, a light beam can circle the earth 7 1/2
times in one second.
</p><p class="paragraph">The speed of light depends on the medium through which the light travels. In empty space, the speed
is 186,000 (1.86 ·  105) miles per second. It is almost the same in air. In water, it slows down to
approximately 140,000 (1.4 ·  105) miles per second. In glass, the speed of light is 124,000 (1.24 ·  10 5)
miles per second. In other words, the speed of light decreases as the density of the substance through
which the light passes increases.
</p><p class="paragraph">The velocity of light, which is the same as the velocity of other electromagnetic waves, is considered
to be constant, at 186,000 miles per second. If expressed in meters, it is 300,000,000 meters per second.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Reflection of Light
</h3><p class="paragraph">Light waves obey the law of reflection in the same manner as other types of waves. Consider the
straight path of a light ray admitted through a narrow slit into a darkened room. The straight path of the
beam is made visible by illuminated dust particles suspended in the air. If the light beam is made to fall
onto the surface of a mirror or other reflecting surface, however, the direction of the beam changes
sharply. The light can be reflected in almost any direction depending on the angle at which the mirror is
held.
</p><p class="paragraph">As shown earlier in figure 1-9, if a light beam strikes a mirror, the angle at which the beam is
reflected depends on the angle at which it strikes the mirror. The beam approaching the mirror is the
INCIDENT or striking beam, and the beam leaving the mirror is the REFLECTED beam.
</p><p class="paragraph">The term "reflected light" simply refers to light waves that are neither transmitted nor absorbed, but
are thrown back from the surface of the medium they encounter.
</p><p class="paragraph">You will see this application used in our discussion of radio waves (chapter 2) and antennas (chapter
4).
</p><p class="question"> Q39. At what speed does light travel?
Refraction of Light

another of different density is called refraction. Refraction is due to the fact that light travels at various</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">speeds in different transparent substances. For example, water never appears as deep as it really is, and
objects under water appear to be closer to the surface than they really are. A bending of the light rays
causes these impressions.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another example of refraction is the apparent bending of a spoon when it is immersed in a cup of
water. The bending seems to take place at the surface of the water, or exactly at the point where there is a
change of density. Obviously, the spoon does not bend from the pressure of the water. The light forming
the image of the spoon is bent as it passes from the water (a medium of high density) to the air (a medium
of comparatively low density).
</p><p class="paragraph">Without refraction, light waves would pass in straight lines through transparent substances without
any change of direction. Refer back to figure 1-10, which shows refraction of a wave. As you can see, all
rays striking the glass at any angle other than perpendicular are refracted. However, the perpendicular ray,
which enters the glass normal to the surface, continues through the glass and into the air in a straight line
no refraction takes place.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Diffusion of Light
</h3><p class="paragraph">When light is reflected from a mirror, the angle of reflection of each ray equals the angle of
incidence. When light is reflected from a piece of plain white paper, however, the reflected beam is
scattered, or DIFFUSED, as shown in figure 1-21. Because the surface of the paper is not smooth, the
reflected light is broken up into many light beams that are reflected in all directions.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Absorption of Light
</h3><p class="paragraph">You have just seen that a light beam is reflected and diffused when it falls onto a piece of white
paper. If a light beam falls onto a piece of black paper, the black paper absorbs most of the light rays and
very little light is reflected from the paper. If the surface on which the light beam falls is perfectly black,
there is no reflection; that is, the light is totally absorbed. No matter what kind of surface light falls on,
however, some of the light is absorbed.
</p><p class="question"> Q40. A light wave enters a sheet of glass at a perfect right angle to the surface. Is the majority of the
wave reflected, refracted, transmitted, or absorbed?

this scattering of light?</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMPARISON-OF-LIGHT-WAVES-WITH-SOUND-WAVES-1-32-">COMPARISON OF LIGHT WAVES WITH SOUND WAVES
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are two main differences between sound waves and light waves. The first difference is in
velocity. Sound waves travel through air at the speed of approximately 1,100 feet per second; light waves
travel through air and empty space at a speed of approximately 186,000 miles per second. The second
difference is that sound is composed of longitudinal waves (alternate compressions and expansions of
matter) and light is composed of transverse waves in an electromagnetic field.
</p><p class="paragraph">Although both are forms of wave motion, sound requires a solid, liquid, or gaseous medium; whereas
light travels through empty space. The denser the medium, the greater the speed of sound. The opposite is
true of light. Light travels approximately one-third slower in water than in air. Sound travels through all
substances, but light cannot pass through opaque materials.
</p><p class="paragraph">Frequency affects both sound and light. A certain range of sound frequencies produces sensations
that you can hear. A slow vibration (low frequency) in sound gives the sensation of a low note. A more
rapid sound vibration (higher frequency) produces a higher note. Likewise, a certain range of light
frequencies produces sensations that you can see. Violet light is produced at the high-frequency end of the
light spectrum, while red light is produced at the low-frequency end of the light spectrum. A change in
frequency of sound waves causes an audible sensation—a difference in pitch. A change in the frequency
of a light wave causes a visual sensation—a difference in color.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Light is one kind of electromagnetic energy. There are many other types, including heat energy and
radio energy. The only difference between the various types of electromagnetic energy is the frequency of
their waves (rate of vibration). The term SPECTRUM is used to designate the entire range of
electromagnetic waves arranged in order of their frequencies. The VISIBLE SPECTRUM contains only
those waves which stimulate the sense of sight. You, as a technician, might be expected to maintain
equipment that uses electromagnetic waves within, above, and below the visible spectrum.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are neither sharp dividing lines nor gaps in the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM. Figure
1-22 illustrates how portions of the electromagnetic spectrum overlap. Notice that only a small portion of
the electromagnetic spectrum contains visible waves, or light, which can be seen by the human eye.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The study of antennas and electromagnetic wave propagation is essential to a complete
understanding of radio communication, radar, loran, and other electronic systems. Figure 1-23 shows a
simple radio communication system. In the illustration, the transmitter is an electronic device that
generates radio-frequency energy. The energy travels through a transmission line (we will discuss this in
chapter 3) to an antenna. The antenna converts the energy into radio waves that radiate into space from
the antenna at the speed of light. The radio waves travel through the atmosphere or space until they are
either reflected by an object or absorbed. If another antenna is placed in the path of the radio waves, it
absorbs part of the waves and converts them to energy. This energy travels through another transmission
line and is fed to a receiver. From this example, you can see that the requirements for a simple
communications system are (1) transmitting equipment, (2) transmission line, (3) transmitting antenna,
(4) medium, (5) receiving antenna, and (6) receiving equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">An antenna is a conductor or a set of conductors used either to radiate electromagnetic energy into
space or to collect this energy from space. Figure 1-24 shows an antenna. View A is a drawing of an
actual antenna; view B is a cut-away view of the antenna; and view C is a simplified diagram of the

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMPONENTS-OF-THE-ELECTROMAGNETIC-WAVE-1-35-">COMPONENTS OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE
</h2><p class="paragraph">An electromagnetic wave consists of two primary components—an ELECTRIC FIELD and a
MAGNETIC FIELD. The electric field results from the force of voltage, and the magnetic field results
from the flow of current.
</p><p class="paragraph">Although electromagnetic fields that are radiated are commonly considered to be waves, under
certain circumstances their behavior makes them appear to have some of the properties of particles. In
general, however, it is easier to picture electromagnetic radiation in space as horizontal and vertical lines
of force oriented at right angles to each other. These lines of force are made up of an electric field (E) and
a magnetic field (H), which together make up the electromagnetic field in space.
</p><p class="paragraph">The electric and magnetic fields radiated from an antenna form the electromagnetic field. This field
is responsible for the transmission and reception of electromagnetic energy through free space. An
antenna, however, is also part of the electrical circuit of a transmitter or a receiver and is equivalent to a
circuit containing inductance, capacitance, and resistance. Therefore, the antenna can be expected to
display definite voltage and current relationships with respect to a given input. A current through the
antenna produces a magnetic field, and a charge on the antenna produces an electric field. These two
fields combine to form the INDUCTION field. To help you gain a better understanding of antenna theory,
we must review some basic electrical concepts. We will review voltage and its electric field, current and
its magnetic field, and their relationship to propagation of electrical energy.

</p><p class="question"> Q45. What do we call a conductor (or set of conductors) that radiates electromagnetic energy into
space?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Electric Field
</h3><p class="paragraph">Around every electrically charged object is a force field that can be detected and measured. This
force field can cause electric charges to move in the field. When an object is charged electrically, there is
either a greater or a smaller concentration of electrons than normal. Thus, a difference of potential exists
between a charged object and an uncharged object. An electric field is, therefore, associated with a
difference of potential, or a voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">This invisible field of force is commonly represented by lines that are drawn to show the paths along
which the force acts. The lines representing the electric field are drawn in the direction that a single
positive charge would normally move under the influence of that field. A large electric force is shown by
a large concentration of lines; a weak force is indicated by a few lines.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a capacitor is connected across a source of voltage, such as a battery, it is charged by a
particular amount, depending on the voltage and the value of capacitance. (See figure 1-25.) Because of
the emf (electromotive force) of the battery, negative charges flow to the lower plate, leaving the upper
plate positively charged. Along with the growth of charge, the electric field is also building up. The flux
lines are directed from the positive to the negative charges and at right angles to the plates. When the
capacitor is fully charged, the voltage of the capacitor is equal to the voltage of the source and opposite in
polarity. The charged capacitor stores the energy in the form of an electric field. It can be said, therefore,
that an electric field indicates voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the two plates of the capacitor are spread farther apart, the electric field must curve to meet the
plates at right angles (fig. 1-26). The straight lines in view A of figure 1-26 become arcs in view B, and
approximately semicircles in view C, where the plates are in a straight line. Instead of flat metal plates, as
in the capacitor, the two elements can take the form of metal rods or wires and form the basic antenna.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 1-27, two rods replace the plates of the capacitor, and the battery is replaced by an ac
source generating a 60-hertz signal. On the positive alternation of the 60-hertz generator, the electric field
extends from the positively charged rod to the negatively charged rod, as shown. On the negative
alternation, the charge is reversed. The previous explanation of electrons moving from one plate to the
other of the capacitor in figure 1-25 can also be applied to the rods in figure 1-27.

</p><p class="paragraph">The polarity of charges and the direction of the electric fields will reverse polarity and direction
periodically at the frequency of the voltage source. The electric field will build up from zero to maximum
in one direction and then collapse back to zero. Next, the field will build up to maximum in the opposite
direction and then collapse back to zero. This complete reversal occurs during a single cycle of the source
voltage. The HALF-WAVE DIPOLE ANTENNA (two separate rods in line as illustrated in figure 1-27)
is the fundamental element normally used as a starting point of reference in any discussion concerning the
radiation of electromagnetic energy into space. If rf energy from the ac generator (or transmitter) is
supplied to the element of an antenna, the voltage across the antenna lags the current by 90 degrees. The
antenna acts as if it were a capacitor.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Magnetic Field
</h3><p class="paragraph">When current flows through a conductor, a magnetic field is set up in the area surrounding the
conductor. In fact, any moving electrical charge will create a magnetic field. The magnetic field is a
region in space where a magnetic force can be detected and measured. There are two other fields
involved—an INDUCTION FIELD, which exists close to the conductor carrying the current, and the
RADIATION FIELD, which becomes detached from the current-carrying rod and travels through space.
</p><p class="paragraph">To represent the magnetic field, lines of force are again used to illustrate the energy. Magnetic lines
are not drawn between the rods, nor between high- and low-potential points, as the E lines that were
discussed earlier. Magnetic lines are created by the flow of current rather than the force of voltage. The
magnetic lines of force, therefore, are drawn at right angles to the direction of current flow.
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnetic fields that are set up around two parallel rods, as shown in figure 1-28 view A, are in
maximum opposition. Rod 1 contains a current flowing from the generator, while rod 2 contains a current
flowing toward the generator. As a result, the direction of the magnetic field surrounding rod 1 is opposite
the direction of the magnetic field surrounding rod 2. This will cause cancellation of part or all of both
magnetic fields with a resultant decrease in radiation of the electromagnetic energy. View B illustrates the
fact that if the far ends of rods 1 and 2 are separated from each other while the rods are still connected to
the generator at the near ends, more space, and consequently less opposition, will occur between the
magnetic fields of the two rods. View C illustrates the fact that placing the rods in line makes the currents
through both rods flow in the same direction. Therefore, the two magnetic fields are in the same direction;
thus, maximum electromagnetic radiation into space can be obtained.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Magnetic lines of force are indicated by the letter H and are called H lines. The direction of the
magnetic lines may be determined by use of the left-hand rule for a conductor: If you grasp the conductor
in your left hand with the thumb extended in the direction of the current flow, your fingers will point in
the direction of the magnetic lines of force. In view C of figure 1-28, the direction of current flow is
upward along both halves of the elements (conductors). The lines of magnetic force (flux) form
concentric loops that are perpendicular to the direction of current flow. The arrowheads on the loops
indicate the direction of the field. The left-hand rule is used to determine the direction of the magnetic
field and is illustrated in figure 1-29. If the thumb of the left hand is extended in the direction of current
flow and the fingers clenched, then the rough circles formed by the fingers indicate the direction of the
magnetic field.

Combined Electric and Magnetic Fields
</p><p class="paragraph">The generator, shown in figure 1-30, provides the voltage, which creates an electric field, and
current, which creates a magnetic field. This source voltage and current build up to maximum values in
one direction during one half-cycle, and then build up to maximum values in the other direction during
the next half-cycle. Both the electric and magnetic fields alternate from minimum through maximum
values in synchronization with the changing voltage and current. The electric and magnetic fields reach
their maximum intensity a quarter-cycle apart. These fields form the induction field. Since the current and
voltage that produce these E and H fields are 90 degrees out of phase, the fields will also be 90 degrees
out of phase.

Radio waves cannot be seen or felt.
</p><p class="paragraph">WAVE MOTION can be seen in action by throwing a pebble into a pool of still water. The ripples
that move toward the edge of the pool demonstrate the PROPAGATION theory.

</p><p class="paragraph">The LONGITUDINAL WAVE is another type of wave motion. The sound wave is the only
example of a longitudinal wave given in this text.
</p><p class="paragraph">SOURCE, MEDIUM, AND DETECTOR (RECEIVER) are the three requirements for all wave
motion.
</p><p class="paragraph">A SOURCE can be anything that emits or expends energy (waves).
The MEDIUM is the vehicle for carrying waves from one point to another. Water, air, metal, empty
</p><p class="paragraph">space, etc., are examples of a medium. Empty space is considered a medium for electro-magnetic waves
but not a medium for sound waves.
</p><p class="paragraph">The SOUND DETECTOR absorbs the waves emitted by the source. The human ear is an example
of a detector.
</p><p class="paragraph">HERTZ, which is abbreviated Hz, is used in lieu of "cycle per second" when referring to radio
frequencies.
</p><p class="paragraph">VELOCITY OF PROPAGATION is the speed (or rate) at which the crest of a wave moves
through a medium. Velocity can be calculated by using the formula:

</p><p class="paragraph">REFLECTION occurs when a wave strikes an object and bounces back (toward the source). The
wave that moves from the source to the object is called the INCIDENT WAVE, and the wave that moves

</p><p class="paragraph">The DOPPLER EFFECT is the apparent change in frequency of a source as it moves toward or
away from a detector. It can affect the operation of equipment used to detect and measure wave energy.
</p><p class="paragraph">SOUND can be audible to the human ear or it can be outside the hearing range.
</p><p class="paragraph">NOISE AND TONES are the two general groups that broadly classify ALL sounds.
</p><p class="paragraph">PITCH, INTENSITY, AND QUALITY are the three basic characteristics of sound. Pitch describes
the frequency of sound. Intensity describes how much energy is transmitted. Quality enables us to
distinguish one sound from another.
</p><p class="paragraph">The DENSITY of a MEDIUM, TEMPERATURE, and ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE affect the
velocity of sound. If temperature, density, or pressure increases, the velocity of sound increases and vice
versa.
</p><p class="paragraph">ACOUSTICS is the science of sound and relates to the sense of hearing.
</p><p class="paragraph">ECHO is an example of reflection. Sound echoes are used in sonar and depth finders to determine or
measure the range of an object or the depth of the ocean bottom.
</p><p class="paragraph">REVERBERATION is the multiple reflections of sound waves. The prolonged roar of thunder is
caused by reverberations. With underwater sound equipment, reverberations of nearby objects may
interfere with returning echoes from actual targets.
</p><p class="paragraph">INTERFERENCE occurs when two waves move simultaneously through a medium. They can
interfere constructively, destructively, or produce a resultant of zero.
</p><p class="paragraph">RESONANCE occurs when an objects vibrates (or resonates) at its natural frequency. When
different frequencies are produced inside a cavity, the sound from the cavity sounds louder at its resonant
frequency than at all other frequencies.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The way energy is propagated into free space is a source of great dispute among people concerned 
with it. Although many theories have been proposed, the following theory adequately explains the 
phenomena and has been widely accepted. There are two basic fields associated with every antenna; an 
INDUCTION FIELD and a RADIATION FIELD. The field associated with the energy stored in the 
antenna is the induction field. This field is said to provide no part in the transmission of electromagnetic 
energy through free space. However, without the presence of the induction field, there would be no 
energy radiated. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INDUCTION-FIELD-2-2-">INDUCTION FIELD

induction field is produced. Let's follow the generator through one cycle of operation.

</p><p class="paragraph">Initially, you can consider that the generator output is zero and that no fields exist about the antenna, 
as shown in view A. Now assume that the generator produces a slight potential and has the instantaneous 
polarity shown in view B. Because of this slight potential, the antenna capacitance acts as a short, 
allowing a large flow of current (I) through the antenna in the direction shown. This current flow, in turn, 
produces a large magnetic field about the antenna. Since the flow of current at each end of the antenna is 
minimum, the corresponding magnetic fields at each end of the antenna are also minimum. As time 
passes, charges, which oppose antenna current and produce an electrostatic field (E field), collect at each 
end of the antenna. Eventually, the antenna capacitance becomes fully charged and stops current flow 
through the antenna. Under this condition, the electrostatic field is maximum, and the magnetic field (H 
field) is fully collapsed, as shown in view C. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the generator potential decreases back to zero, the potential of the antenna begins to discharge. 
During the discharging process, the electrostatic field collapses and the direction of current flow reverses, 
as shown in view D. When the current again begins to flow, an associated magnetic field is generated. 
Eventually, the electrostatic field completely collapses, the generator potential reverses, and current is 
maximum, as shown in view E. As charges collect at each end of the antenna, an electrostatic field is 
produced and current flow decreases. This causes the magnetic field to begin collapsing. The collapsing 
magnetic field produces more current flow, a greater accumulation of charge, and a greater electrostatic 
field. The antenna gradually reaches the condition shown in view F, where current is zero and the 
collected charges are maximum. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the generator potential again decreases toward zero, the antenna begins to discharge and the 
electrostatic field begins to collapse. When the generator potential reaches zero, discharge current is 
maximum and the associated magnetic field is maximum. A brief time later, generator potential reverses, 
and the condition shown in view B recurs. 
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: The electric field (E field) and the electrostatic field (E field) are the same. They will be 
used interchangeably throughout this text. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The graph shown in figure 2-2 shows the relationship between the magnetic (H) field and the electric 
(E) field plotted against time. Note that the two fields are 90 degrees out of phase with each other. If you 
compare the graph in figure 2-2 with figure 2-1, you will notice that the two fields around the antenna are 
displaced 90 degrees from each other in space. (The H field exists in a plane perpendicular to the antenna. 
The E field exists in a plane parallel with the antenna, as shown in figure 2-1.)

</p><p class="paragraph">All the energy supplied to the induction field is returned to the antenna by the collapsing E and H 
fields. No energy from the induction field is radiated from the antenna. Therefore, the induction field is 
considered a local field and plays no part in the transmission of electromagnetic energy. The induction 
field represents only the stored energy in the antenna and is responsible only for the resonant effects that 
the antenna reflects to the generator. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADIATION-FIELDS-2-4-">RADIATION FIELDS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The E and H fields that are set up in the transfer of energy through space are known collectively as 
the radiation field. This radiation field is responsible for electromagnetic radiation from the antenna. The 
radiation field decreases as the distance from the antenna is increased. Because the decrease is linear, the 
radiation field reaches great distances from the antenna. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's look at a half-wave antenna to illustrate how this radiation actually takes place. Simply stated, a 
half-wave antenna is one that has an electrical length equal to half the wavelength of the signal being 
transmitted. Assume, for example, that a transmitter is operating at 30 megahertz. If a half-wave antenna 
is used with the transmitter, the antenna's electrical length would have to be at least 16 feet long. (The 
formula used to compute the electrical length of an antenna will be explained in chapter 4.) When power 
is delivered to the half-wave antenna, both an induction field and a radiation field are set up by the 
fluctuating energy. At the antenna, the intensities of these fields are proportional to the amount of power 
delivered to the antenna from a source such as a transmitter. At a short distance from the antenna and 
beyond, only the radiation field exists. This radiation field is made up of an electric component and a 
magnetic component at right angles to each other in space and varying together in intensity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With a high-frequency generator (a transmitter) connected to the antenna, the induction field is 
produced as described in the previous section. However, the generator potential reverses before the 
electrostatic field has had time to collapse completely. The reversed generator potential neutralizes the 
remaining antenna charges, leaving a resultant E field in space. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-3 is a simple picture of an E field detaching itself from an antenna. (The H field will not be 
considered, although it is present.) In view A the voltage is maximum and the electric field has maximum 
intensity. The lines of force begin at the end of the antenna that is positively charged and extend to the 
end of the antenna that is negatively charged. Note that the outer E lines are stretched away from the inner 
lines. This is because of the repelling force that takes place between lines of force in the same direction. 
As the voltage drops (view B), the separated charges come together, and the ends of the lines move 
toward the center of the antenna. But, since lines of force in the same direction repel each other, the 
centers of the lines are still being held out. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the voltage approaches zero (view B), some of the lines collapse back into the antenna. At the 
same time, the ends of other lines begin to come together to form a complete loop. Notice the direction of 
these lines of force next to the antenna in view C. At this point the voltage on the antenna is zero. As the 
charge starts to build up in the opposite direction (view D), electric lines of force again begin at the 
positive end of the antenna and stretch to the negative end of the antenna. These lines of force, being in 
the same direction as the sides of the closed loops next to the antenna, repel the closed loops and force 
them out into space at the speed of light. As these loops travel through space, they generate a magnetic 
field in phase with them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since each successive E field is generated with a polarity that is opposite the preceding E field (that 
is, the lines of force are opposite), an oscillating electric field is produced along the path of travel. When 
an electric field oscillates, a magnetic field having an intensity that varies directly with that of the E field 
is produced. The variations in magnetic field intensity, in turn, produce another E field. Thus, the two 
varying fields sustain each other, resulting in electromagnetic wave propagation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">During this radiation process, the E and H fields are in phase in time but physically displaced 90 
degrees in space. Thus, the varying magnetic field produces a varying electric field; and the varying 
electric field, in turn, sustains the varying magnetic field. Each field supports the other, and neither can be 
propagated by itself. Figure 2-4 shows a comparison between the induction field and the radiation field. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

sine wave that are completed in 1 second is known as the frequency of the sine wave. For example, 60 
cycles of ordinary house current occur each second, so house current is said to have a frequency of 60 
cycles per second or 60 hertz. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The frequencies falling between 3000 hertz (3 kHz) and 300,000,000,000 hertz (300 GHz) are called 
RADIO FREQUENCIES (abbreviated rf) since they are commonly used in radio communications. This 
part of the radio frequency spectrum is divided into bands, each band being 10 times higher in frequency 
than the one immediately below it. This arrangement serves as a convenient way to remember the range 
of each band. The rf bands are shown in table 2-1. The usable radio-frequency range is roughly 10 
kilohertz to 100 gigahertz.

If the frequency is 10 hertz, the period of each cycle is one-tenth of a second. Since the frequency of a

chapter 4 of this module. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The velocity (or speed) of a radio wave radiated into free space by a transmitting antenna is equal to 
the speed of light—186,000 miles per second or 300,000,000 meters per second. Because of various 
factors, such as barometric pressure, humidity, molecular content, etc., radio waves travel inside the 
Earth's atmosphere at a speed slightly less than the speed of light. Normally, in discussions of the velocity 
of radio waves, the velocity referred to is the speed at which radio waves travel in free space. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The frequency of a radio wave has nothing to do with its velocity. A 5-megahertz wave travels 
through space at the same velocity as a 10-megahertz wave. However, the velocity of radio waves is an 
important factor in making wavelength-to-frequency conversions, the subject of our next discussion.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Radio waves are often referred to by their wavelength in meters rather than by frequency. For 
example, most people have heard commercial radio stations make announcements similar to the 
following: "Station WXYZ operating on 240 meters..." To tune receiving equipment that is calibrated by 
frequency to such a station, you must first convert the designated wavelength to its equivalent frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As discussed earlier, a radio wave travels 300,000,000 meters a second (speed of light); therefore, a 
radio wave of 1 hertz would have traveled a distance (or wavelength) of 300,000,000 meters. Obviously 
then, if the frequency of the wave is increased to 2 hertz, the wavelength will be cut in half to 
150,000,000 meters. This illustrates the principle that the HIGHER THE FREQUENCY, the SHORTER 
THE WAVELENGTH. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Wavelength-to-frequency conversions of radio waves are really quite simple because wavelength and 
frequency are reciprocals: Either one divided into the velocity of a radio wave yields the other. 
Remember, the formula for wavelength is:

</p><p class="paragraph">The wavelength in meters divided into 300,000,000 yields the frequency of a radio wave in hertz.

</h2><p class="paragraph">For maximum absorption of energy from the electromagnetic fields, the receiving antenna must be 
located in the plane of polarization. This places the conductor of the antenna at right angles to the 
magnetic lines of force moving through the antenna and parallel to the electric lines, causing maximum 
induction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Normally, the plane of polarization of a radio wave is the plane in which the E field propagates with 
respect to the Earth. If the E field component of the radiated wave travels in a plane perpendicular to the 
Earth's surface (vertical), the radiation is said to be VERTICALLY POLARIZED, as shown in figure 2-5, 
view A. If the E field propagates in a plane parallel to the Earth's surface (horizontal), the radiation is said 
to be HORIZONTALLY POLARIZED, as shown in view B.

cause a greater signal strength along the Earth's surface. On the other hand, antennas high above the 
ground should be horizontally polarized to get the greatest possible signal strength to the Earth's surface. 
Vertically and horizontally polarized antennas will be discussed in more detail in chapter 4. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The radiated energy from an antenna is in the form of an expanding sphere. Any small section of this 
sphere is perpendicular to the direction the energy travels and is called a WAVEFRONT. All energy on a 
wavefront is in phase. Usually all points on the wavefront are at equal distances from the antenna. The 
farther the wavefront is from the antenna, the less spherical the wave appears. At a considerable distance 
the wavefront can be considered as a plane surface at a right angle to the direction of propagation. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

waves. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Reflection 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Radio waves may be reflected from various substances or objects they meet during travel between 
the transmitting and receiving sites. The amount of reflection depends on the reflecting material. Smooth 
metal surfaces of good electrical conductivity are efficient reflectors of radio waves. The surface of the 
Earth itself is a fairly good reflector. The radio wave is not reflected from a single point on the reflector 
but rather from an area on its surface. The size of the area required for reflection to take place depends on 
the wavelength of the radio wave and the angle at which the wave strikes the reflecting substance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When radio waves are reflected from flat surfaces, a phase shift in the alternations of the wave 
occurs. Figure 2-7 shows two radio waves being reflected from the Earth's surface. Notice that the 
positive and negative alternations of radio waves (A) and (B) are in phase with each other in their paths 
toward the Earth's surface. After reflection takes place, however, the waves are approximately 180 
degrees out of phase from their initial relationship. The amount of phase shift that occurs is not constant. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Radio waves that keep their phase relationships after reflection normally produce a stronger signal at the 
receiving site. Those that are received out of phase produce a weak or fading signal. The shifting in the 
phase relationships of reflected radio waves is one of the major reasons for fading. Fading will be 
discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Refraction 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Another phenomenon common to most radio waves is the bending of the waves as they move from 
one medium into another in which the velocity of propagation is different. This bending of the waves is 
called refraction. For example, suppose you are driving down a smoothly paved road at a constant speed 
and suddenly one wheel goes off onto the soft shoulder. The car tends to veer off to one side. The change 
of medium, from hard surface to soft shoulder, causes a change in speed or velocity. The tendency is for 
the car to change direction. This same principle applies to radio waves as changes occur in the medium 
through which they are passing. As an example, the radio wave shown in figure 2-8 is traveling through 
the Earth's atmosphere at a constant speed. As the wave enters the dense layer of electrically charged ions, 
the part of the wave that enters the new medium first travels faster than the parts of the wave that have not 
yet entered the new medium. This abrupt increase in velocity of the upper part of the wave causes the 
wave to bend back toward the Earth. This bending, or change of direction, is always toward the medium 
that has the lower velocity of propagation. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

pressure, humidity, and density. These factors can cause the radio waves to be refracted. This effect will 
be discussed in greater detail later in this chapter. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Diffraction 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A radio wave that meets an obstacle has a natural tendency to bend around the obstacle as illustrated 
in figure 2-9. The bending, called diffraction, results in a change of direction of part of the wave energy 
from the normal line-of-sight path. This change makes it possible to receive energy around the edges of 
an obstacle as shown in view A or at some distances below the highest point of an obstruction, as shown 
in view B. Although diffracted rf energy usually is weak, it can still be detected by a suitable receiver. 
The principal effect of diffraction extends the radio range beyond the visible horizon. In certain cases, by 
using high power and very low frequencies, radio waves can be made to encircle the Earth by diffraction.

</h3><p class="paragraph">This discussion of electromagnetic wave propagation is concerned mainly with the properties and 
effects of the medium located between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna. While radio 
waves traveling in free space have little outside influence affecting them, radio waves traveling within the 
Earth's atmosphere are affected by varying conditions. The influence exerted on radio waves by the 
Earth's atmosphere adds many new factors to complicate what at first seems to be a relatively simple 
problem. These complications are because of a lack of uniformity within the Earth's atmosphere. 
Atmospheric conditions vary with changes in height, geographical location, and even with changes in 
time (day, night, season, year). A knowledge of the composition of the Earth's atmosphere is extremely 
important for understanding wave propagation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Earth's atmosphere is divided into three separate regions, or layers. They are the

Ground waves are radio waves that travel near the surface of the Earth (surface and space waves). Sky 
waves are radio waves that are reflected back to Earth from the ionosphere. (See figure 2-11.)

</p><h3 class="subsection">Ground Waves 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ground wave is actually composed of two separate component waves. These are known as the 
SURFACE WAVE and the SPACE WAVE (fig. 2-11). The determining factor in whether a ground wave 
component is classified as a space wave or a surface wave is simple. A surface wave travels along the 
surface of the Earth. A space wave travels over the surface. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SURFACE WAVE.—The surface wave reaches the receiving site by traveling along the surface of 
the ground as shown in figure 2-12. A surface wave can follow the contours of the Earth because of the 
process of diffraction. When a surface wave meets an object and the dimensions of the object do not 
exceed its wavelength, the wave tends to curve or bend around the object. The smaller the object, the 
more pronounced the diffractive action will be. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As a surface wave passes over the ground, the wave induces a voltage in the Earth. The induced 
voltage takes energy away from the surface wave, thereby weakening, or attenuating, the wave as it 
moves away from the transmitting antenna. To reduce the attenuation, the amount of induced voltage 
must be reduced. This is done by using vertically polarized waves that minimize the extent to which the 
electric field of the wave is in contact with the Earth. When a surface wave is horizontally polarized, the 
electric field of the wave is parallel with the surface of the Earth and, therefore, is constantly in contact 
with it. The wave is then completely attenuated within a short distance from the transmitting site. On the 
other hand, when the surface wave is vertically polarized, the electric field is vertical to the Earth and 
merely dips into and out of the Earth's surface. For this reason, vertical polarization is vastly superior to 
horizontal polarization for surface wave propagation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The attenuation that a surface wave undergoes because of induced voltage also depends on the 
electrical properties of the terrain over which the wave travels. The best type of surface is one that has 
good electrical conductivity. The better the conductivity, the less the attenuation. Table 2-2 gives the 
relative conductivity of various surfaces of the Earth.

</h3><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another major factor in the attenuation of surface waves is frequency. Recall from earlier 
discussions on wavelength that the higher the frequency of a radio wave, the shorter its wavelength will 
be. These high frequencies, with their shorter wavelengths, are not normally diffracted but are absorbed 
by the Earth at points relatively close to the transmitting site. You can assume, therefore, that as the 
frequency of a surface wave is increased, the more rapidly the surface wave will be absorbed, or 
attenuated, by the Earth. Because of this loss by attenuation, the surface wave is impractical for long-
distance transmissions at frequencies above 2 megahertz. On the other hand, when the frequency of a 
surface wave is low enough to have a very long wavelength, the Earth appears to be very small, and 
diffraction is sufficient for propagation well beyond the horizon. In fact, by lowering the transmitting 
frequency into the very low frequency (vlf) range and using very high-powered transmitters, the surface 
wave can be propagated great distances. The Navy's extremely high-powered vlf transmitters are actually 
capable of transmitting surface wave signals around the Earth and can provide coverage to naval units 
operating anywhere at sea. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SPACE WAVE.—The space wave follows two distinct paths from the transmitting antenna to the 
receiving antenna—one through the air directly to the receiving antenna, the other reflected from the 
ground to the receiving antenna. This is illustrated in figure 2-13. The primary path of the space wave is 
directly from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. So, the receiving antenna must be located 
within the radio horizon of the transmitting antenna. Because space waves are refracted slightly, even 
when propagated through the troposphere, the radio horizon is actually about one-third farther than the 
line-of-sight or natural horizon. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Although space waves suffer little ground attenuation, they nevertheless are susceptible to fading. 
This is because space waves actually follow two paths of different lengths (direct path and ground 
reflected path) to the receiving site and, therefore, may arrive in or out of phase. If these two component 
waves are received in phase, the result is a reinforced or stronger signal. Likewise, if they are received out 
of phase, they tend to cancel one another, which results in a weak or fading signal.

</h3><p class="paragraph">The sky wave, often called the ionospheric wave, is radiated in an upward direction and returned to 
Earth at some distant location because of refraction from the ionosphere. This form of propagation is 
relatively unaffected by the Earth's surface and can propagate signals over great distances. Usually the 
high frequency (hf) band is used for sky wave propagation. The following in-depth study of the 
ionosphere and its effect on sky waves will help you to better understand the nature of sky wave 
propagation. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-STRUCTURE-OF-THE-IONOSPHERE-2-18-">STRUCTURE OF THE IONOSPHERE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">As we stated earlier, the ionosphere is the region of the atmosphere that extends from about 30 miles 
above the surface of the Earth to about 250 miles. It is appropriately named the ionosphere because it 
consists of several layers of electrically charged gas atoms called ions. The ions are formed by a process 
called ionization. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Ionization 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Ionization occurs when high energy ultraviolet light waves from the sun enter the ionospheric region 
of the atmosphere, strike a gas atom, and literally knock an electron free from its parent atom. A normal 
atom is electrically neutral since it contains both a positive proton in its nucleus and a negative orbiting 
electron. When the negative electron is knocked free from the atom, the atom becomes positively charged 
(called a positive ion) and remains in space along with the free electron, which is negatively charged. This 
process of upsetting electrical neutrality is known as IONIZATION. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The free negative electrons subsequently absorb part of the ultraviolet energy, which initially freed 
them from their atoms. As the ultraviolet light wave continues to produce positive ions and negative 
electrons, its intensity decreases because of the absorption of energy by the free electrons, and an ionized 
layer is formed. The rate at which ionization occurs depends on the density of atoms in the atmosphere 
and the intensity of the ultraviolet light wave, which varies with the activity of the sun. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the atmosphere is bombarded by ultraviolet light waves of different frequencies, several 
ionized layers are formed at different altitudes. Lower frequency ultraviolet waves penetrate the 
atmosphere the least; therefore, they produce ionized layers at the higher altitudes. Conversely, ultraviolet 
waves of higher frequencies penetrate deeper and produce layers at the lower altitudes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An important factor in determining the density of ionized layers is the elevation angle of the sun, 
which changes frequently. For this reason, the height and thickness of the ionized layers vary, depending 
on the time of day and even the season of the year. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Recombination 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Recall that the process of ionization involves ultraviolet light waves knocking electrons free from 
their atoms. A reverse process called RECOMBINATION occurs when the free electrons and positive 
ions collide with each other. Since these collisions are inevitable, the positive ions return to their original 
neutral atom state. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The recombination process also depends on the time of day. Between the hours of early morning and 
late afternoon, the rate of ionization exceeds the rate of recombination. During this period, the ionized 
layers reach their greatest density and exert maximum influence on radio waves. During the late afternoon 
and early evening hours, however, the rate of recombination exceeds the rate of ionization, and the 
density of the ionized layers begins to decrease. Throughout the night, density continues to decrease, 
reaching a low point just before sunrise. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Four Distinct Layers 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ionosphere is composed of three layers designated D, E, and F, from lowest level to highest 
level as shown in figure 2-14. The F layer is further divided into two layers designated F1 (the lower 
layer) and F2 (the higher layer). The presence or absence of these layers in the ionosphere and their height 
above the Earth varies with the position of the sun. At high noon, radiation in the ionosphere directly 
above a given point is greatest. At night it is minimum. When the radiation is removed, many of the 
particles that were ionized recombine. The time interval between these conditions finds the position and 
number of the ionized layers within the ionosphere changing. Since the position of the sun varies daily, 
monthly, and yearly, with respect to a specified point on Earth, the exact position and number of layers 
present are extremely difficult to determine. However, the following general statements can be made: </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

lowest region of the ionosphere. This layer has the ability to refract signals of low frequencies. 
High frequencies pass right through it and are attenuated. After sunset, the D layer disappears 
because of the rapid recombination of ions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">b. The E layer limits are from about 55 to 90 miles. This layer is also known as the Kennelly-
Heaviside layer, because these two men were the first to propose its existence. The rate of ionic 
recombination in this layer is rather rapid after sunset and the layer is almost gone by midnight. 
This layer has the ability to refract signals as high as 20 megahertz. For this reason, it is valuable 
for communications in ranges up to about 1500 miles. 
</p><p class="paragraph">c. The F layer exists from about 90 to 240 miles. During the daylight hours, the F layer separates 
into two layers, the F1 and F2 layers. The ionization level in these layers is quite high and varies 
widely during the day. At noon, this portion of the atmosphere is closest to the sun and the degree 
of ionization is maximum. Since the atmosphere is rarefied at these heights, recombination occurs 
slowly after sunset. Therefore, a fairly constant ionized layer is always present. The F layers are 
responsible for high-frequency, long distance transmission.

layer has a central region of relatively dense ionization, which tapers off in intensity both above and 
below the maximum region. As a radio wave enters a region of INCREASING ionization, the increase in 
velocity of the upper part of the wave causes it to be bent back TOWARD the Earth. While the wave is in 
the highly dense center portion of the layer, however, refraction occurs more slowly because the density 
of ionization is almost uniform. As the wave enters into the upper part of the layer of DECREASING 
ionization, the velocity of the upper part of the wave decreases, and the wave is bent AWAY from the 
Earth.

layers are often several miles thick, ionospheric reflection is more likely to occur at long wavelengths 
(low frequencies). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Frequency 
</h3><p class="paragraph">For any given time, each ionospheric layer has a maximum frequency at which radio waves can be 
transmitted vertically and refracted back to Earth. This frequency is known as the CRITICAL 
FREQUENCY. It is a term that you will hear frequently in any discussion of radio wave propagation. 
Radio waves transmitted at frequencies higher than the critical frequency of a given layer will pass 
through the layer and be lost in space; but if these same waves enter an upper layer with a higher critical 
frequency, they will be refracted back to Earth. Radio waves of frequencies lower than the critical

degree of ionization. Figure 2-16 shows three separate waves of different frequencies entering an 
ionospheric layer at the same angle. Notice that the 5-megahertz wave is refracted quite sharply. The 
20-megahertz wave is refracted less sharply and returned to Earth at a greater distance. The 
100-megahertz wave is obviously greater than the critical frequency for that ionized layer and, therefore, 
is not refracted but is passed into space. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Angle of Incidence 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The rate at which a wave of a given frequency is refracted by an ionized layer depends on the angle 
at which the wave enters the layer. Figure 2-17 shows three radio waves of the same frequency entering a 
layer at different angles. The angle at which wave A strikes the layer is too nearly vertical for the wave to 
be refracted to Earth. As the wave enters the layer, it is bent slightly but passes through the layer and is 
lost. When the wave is reduced to an angle that is less than vertical (wave B), it strikes the layer and is 
refracted back to Earth. The angle made by wave B is called the CRITICAL ANGLE for that particular 
frequency. Any wave that leaves the antenna at an angle greater than the critical angle will penetrate the 
ionospheric layer for that frequency and then be lost in space. Wave C strikes the ionosphere at the 
smallest angle at which the wave can be refracted and still return to Earth. At any smaller angle, the wave 
will be refracted but will not return to Earth. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">In figure 2-19, note the relationship between the sky wave skip distance, the skip zone, and the 
ground wave coverage. The SKIP DISTANCE is the distance from the transmitter to the point where the 
sky wave is first returned to Earth. The size of the skip distance depends on the frequency of the wave, the 
angle of incidence, and the degree of ionization present. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The SKIP ZONE is a zone of silence between the point where the ground wave becomes too weak 
for reception and the point where the sky wave is first returned to Earth. The size of the skip zone 
depends on the extent of the ground wave coverage and the skip distance. When the ground wave 
coverage is great enough or the skip distance is short enough that no zone of silence occurs, there is no 
skip zone. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Occasionally, the first sky wave will return to Earth within the range of the ground wave. If the sky 
wave and ground wave are nearly of equal intensity, the sky wave alternately reinforces and cancels the 
ground wave, causing severe fading. This is caused by the phase difference between the two waves, a 
result of the longer path traveled by the sky wave.

various angles at which rf energy strikes the layer are represented by dark lines and designated as rays 1 
through 6. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the angle is relatively low with respect to the horizon (ray 1), there is only slight penetration of 
the layer and the propagation path is long. When the angle of incidence is increased (rays 2 and 3), the 
rays penetrate deeper into the layer but the range of these rays decreases. When a certain angle is reached 
(ray 3), the penetration of the layer and rate of refraction are such that the ray is first returned to Earth at a 
minimal distance from the transmitter. Notice, however, that ray 3 still manages to reach the receiving site 
on its second refraction (called a hop) from the ionospheric layer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the angle is increased still more (rays 4 and 5), the rf energy penetrates the central area of 
maximum ionization of the layer. These rays are refracted rather slowly and are eventually returned to 
Earth at great distances. As the angle approaches vertical incidence (ray 6), the ray is not returned at all, 
but passes on through the layer. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ABSORPTION-IN-THE-IONOSPHERE-2-25-">ABSORPTION IN THE IONOSPHERE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Many factors affect a radio wave in its path between the transmitting and receiving sites. The factor 
that has the greatest adverse effect on radio waves is ABSORPTION. Absorption results in the loss of 
energy of a radio wave and has a pronounced effect on both the strength of received signals and the 
ability to communicate over long distances. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You learned earlier in the section on ground waves that surface waves suffer most of their absorption 
losses because of ground-induced voltage. Sky waves, on the other hand, suffer most of their absorption 
losses because of conditions in the ionosphere. Note that some absorption of sky waves may also occur at 
lower atmospheric levels because of the presence of water and water vapor. However, this becomes 
important only at frequencies above 10,000 megahertz. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Most ionospheric absorption occurs in the lower regions of the ionosphere where ionization density 
is greatest. As a radio wave passes into the ionosphere, it loses some of its energy to the free electrons and 
ions. If these high-energy free electrons and ions do not collide with gas molecules of low energy, most of 
the energy lost by the radio wave is reconverted into electromagnetic energy, and the wave continues to 
be propagated with little change in intensity. However, if the high-energy free electrons and ions do 
collide with other particles, much of this energy is lost, resulting in absorption of the energy from the 
wave. Since absorption of energy depends on collision of the particles, the greater the density of the 
ionized layer, the greater the probability of collisions; therefore, the greater the absorption. The highly 
dense D and E layers provide the greatest absorption of radio waves. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because the amount of absorption of the sky wave depends on the density of the ionosphere, which 
varies with seasonal and daily conditions, it is impossible to express a fixed relationship between distance 
and signal strength for ionospheric propagation. Under certain conditions, the absorption of energy is so 
great that communicating over any distance beyond the line of sight is difficult. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FADING-2-26-">FADING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The most troublesome and frustrating problem in receiving radio signals is variations in signal 
strength, most commonly known as FADING. There are several conditions that can produce fading. 
When a radio wave is refracted by the ionosphere or reflected from the Earth's surface, random changes in 
the polarization of the wave may occur. Vertically and horizontally mounted receiving antennas are 
designed to receive vertically and horizontally polarized waves, respectively. Therefore, changes in 
polarization cause changes in the received signal level because of the inability of the antenna to receive 
polarization changes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Fading also results from absorption of the rf energy in the ionosphere. Absorption fading occurs for a 
longer period than other types of fading, since absorption takes place slowly. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Usually, however, fading on ionospheric circuits is mainly a result of multipath propagation. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Multipath Fading 
</h3><p class="paragraph">MULTIPATH is simply a term used to describe the multiple paths a radio wave may follow between 
transmitter and receiver. Such propagation paths include the ground wave, ionospheric refraction, 
reradiation by the ionospheric layers, reflection from the Earth's surface or from more than one 
ionospheric layer, etc. Figure 2-21 shows a few of the paths that a signal can travel between two sites in a 
typical circuit. One path, XYZ, is the basic ground wave. Another path, XEA, refracts the wave at the E 
layer and passes it on to the receiver at A. Still another path, XFZFA, results from a greater angle of 
incidence and two refractions from the F layer. At point Z, the received signal is a combination of the 
ground wave and the sky wave. These two signals having traveled different paths arrive at point Z at 
different times. Thus, the arriving waves may or may not be in phase with each other. Radio waves that 
are received in phase reinforce each other and produce a stronger signal at the receiving site. Conversely, 
those that are received out of phase produce a weak or fading signal. Small alternations in the 
transmission path may change the phase relationship of the two signals, causing periodic fading. This 
condition occurs at point A. At this point, the double-hop F layer signal may be in or out of phase with the 
signal arriving from the E layer. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

DIVERSITY. In space diversity, two or more receiving antennas are spaced some distance apart. Fading 
does not occur simultaneously at both antennas; therefore, enough output is almost always available from 
one of the antennas to provide a useful signal. In frequency diversity, two transmitters and two receivers 
are used, each pair tuned to a different frequency, with the same information being transmitted 
simultaneously over both frequencies. One of the two receivers will almost always provide a useful 
signal. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Selective Fading 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Fading resulting from multipath propagation is variable with frequency since each frequency arrives 
at the receiving point via a different radio path. When a wide band of frequencies is transmitted 
simultaneously, each frequency will vary in the amount of fading. This variation is called SELECTIVE 
FADING. When selective fading occurs, all frequencies of the transmitted signal do not retain their 
original phases and relative amplitudes. This fading causes severe distortion of the signal and limits the 
total signal transmitted.

for a large part of these energy losses. There are two other types of losses that also significantly affect the 
ionospheric propagation of radio waves. These losses are known as ground reflection loss and free space 
loss. The combined effects of absorption, ground reflection loss, and free space loss account for most of 
the energy losses of radio transmissions propagated by the ionosphere. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

angle of incidence, ground irregularities, and the electrical conductivity of the point of reflection. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Free space Loss 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Normally, the major loss of energy is because of the spreading out of the wavefront as it travels away 
from the transmitter. As the distance increases, the area of the wavefront spreads out, much like the beam 
of a flashlight. This means the amount of energy contained within any unit of area on the wavefront will 
decrease as distance increases. By the time the energy arrives at the receiving antenna, the wavefront is so 
spread out that the receiving antenna extends into only a very small fraction of the wavefront. This is 
illustrated in figure 2-22.

ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE (EMI). This interference can result in annoying or impossible 
operating conditions. Sources of emi are both man-made and natural.

specifically designed for this purpose. Examples are ignition systems, generators, motors, switches, 
relays, and voltage regulators. The intensity of man-made interference may vary throughout the day and

manner as radio waves. As a result, when ionospheric conditions are favorable for the long distance 
propagation of radio waves, they are likewise favorable for the propagation of natural interference. 
Natural interference is very erratic, particularly in the hf band, but generally will decrease as the operating

</h2><p class="paragraph">Because the existence of the ionosphere is directly related to radiations emitted from the sun, the 
movement of the Earth about the sun or changes in the sun's activity will result in variations in the 
ionosphere. These variations are of two general types: (1) those which are more or less regular and occur 
in cycles and, therefore, can be predicted in advance with reasonable accuracy, and (2) those which are 
irregular as a result of abnormal behavior of the sun and, therefore, cannot be predicted in advance. Both 
regular and irregular variations have important effects on radio wave propagation. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Regular Variations 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The regular variations that affect the extent of ionization in the ionosphere can be divided into four 
main classes: daily, seasonal, 11-year, and 27-day variations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DAILY.—Daily variations in the ionosphere are a result of the 24-hour rotation of the Earth about 
its axis. Daily variations of the different layers (fig. 2-14) are summarized as follows: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• The D layer reflects vlf waves; is important for long range vlf communications; refracts lf and mf 
waves for short range communications; absorbs hf waves; has little effect on vhf and above; and 
disappears at night. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">2-30 
</p><p class="paragraph">• In the E layer, ionization depends on the angle of the sun. The E layer refracts hf waves during 
the day up to 20 megahertz to distances of about 1200 miles. Ionization is greatly reduced at 
night. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Structure and density of the F region depend on the time of day and the angle of the sun. This 
region consists of one layer during the night and splits into two layers during daylight hours. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Ionization density of the F1 layer depends on the angle of the sun. Its main effect is to absorb hf 
waves passing through to the F2 layer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• The F2 layer is the most important layer for long distance hf communications. It is a very variable 
layer and its height and density change with time of day, season, and sunspot activity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SEASONAL.—Seasonal variations are the result of the Earth revolving around the sun; the relative 
position of the sun moves from one hemisphere to the other with changes in seasons.  Seasonal variations 
of the D, E, and F1 layers correspond to the highest angle of the sun; thus the ionization density of these 
layers is greatest during the summer. The F2 layer, however, does not follow this pattern; its ionization is 
greatest in winter and least in summer, the reverse of what might be expected. As a result, operating 
frequencies for F2 layer propagation are higher in the winter than in the summer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">ELEVEN-YEAR SUN SPOT CYCLE.—One of the most notable phenomena on the surface of the 
sun is the appearance and disappearance of dark, irregularly shaped areas known as SUNSPOTS. The 
exact nature of sunspots is not known, but scientists believe they are caused by violent eruptions on the 
sun and are characterized by unusually strong magnetic fields. These sunspots are responsible for 
variations in the ionization level of the ionosphere. Sunspots can, of course, occur unexpectedly, and the 
life span of individual sunspots is variable; however, a regular cycle of sunspot activity has also been 
observed. This cycle has both a minimum and maximum level of sunspot activity that occur 
approximately every 11 years. 
</p><p class="paragraph">During periods of maximum sunspot activity, the ionization density of all layers increases. Because 
of this, absorption in the D layer increases and the critical frequencies for the E, F1, and F2 layers are 
higher. At these times, higher operating frequencies must be used for long distance communications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">27-DAY SUNSPOT CYCLE.—The number  of sunspots in existence at any one time is continually 
subject to change as some disappear and new ones emerge. As the sun rotates on its own axis, these 
sunspots are visible at 27-day intervals, the approximate period required for the sun to make one complete 
rotation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The 27-day sunspot cycle causes variations in the ionization density of the layers on a day-to-day 
basis. The fluctuations in the F2 layer are greater than for any other layer. For this reason, precise 
predictions on a day-to-day basis of the critical frequency of the F2 layer are not possible. In calculating 
frequencies for long-distance communications, allowances for the fluctuations of the F2 layer must be 
made. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Irregular Variations 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Irregular variations in ionospheric conditions also have an important effect on radio wave 
propagation. Because these variations are irregular and unpredictable, they can drastically affect 
communications capabilities without any warning. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The more common irregular variations are sporadic E, sudden ionospheric disturbances, and 
ionospheric storms. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">SPORADIC E.—Irregular cloud-like patches of unusually high ionization, called sporadic E, often 
form at heights near the normal E layer. Exactly what causes this phenomenon is not known, nor can its 
occurrence be predicted. It is known to vary significantly with latitude, and in the northern latitudes, it 
appears to be closely related to the aurora borealis or northern lights. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At times the sporadic E is so thin that radio waves penetrate it easily and are returned to earth by the 
upper layers. At other times, it extends up to several hundred miles and is heavily ionized. 
</p><p class="paragraph">These characteristics may be either harmful or helpful to radio wave propagation. For example, 
sporadic E may blank out the use of higher, more favorable ionospheric layers or cause additional 
absorption of the radio wave at some frequencies. Also, it can cause additional multipath problems and 
delay the arrival times of the rays of rf energy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">On the other hand, the critical frequency of the sporadic E is very high and can be greater than 
double the critical frequency of the normal ionospheric layers. This condition may permit the long 
distance transmission of signals at unusually high frequencies. It may also permit short distance 
communications to locations that would normally be in the skip zone. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The sporadic E can form and disappear in a short time during either the day or night. However, it 
usually does not occur at the same time at all transmitting or receiving stations.

irregularities is known as a SUDDEN IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE (sid). These disturbances may 
occur without warning and may prevail for any length of time, from a few minutes to several hours. When 
sid occurs, long distance propagation of hf radio waves is almost totally "blanked out." The immediate 
effect is that radio operators listening on normal frequencies are inclined to believe their receivers have 
gone dead. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When sid has occurred, examination of the sun has revealed a bright solar eruption. All stations lying 
wholly, or in part, on the sunward side of the Earth are affected. The solar eruption produces an unusually 
intense burst of ultraviolet light, which is not absorbed by the F2, F1, and E layers, but instead causes a 
sudden abnormal increase in the ionization density of the D layer. As a result, frequencies above 1 or 2 
megahertz are unable to penetrate the D layer and are usually completely absorbed by the layer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">IONOSPHERIC STORMS.—Ionospheric storms are disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field. 
They are associated, in a manner not fully understood, with both solar eruptions and the 27-day intervals, 
thus corresponding to the rotation of the sun. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Scientists believe that ionospheric storms result from particle radiation from the sun. Particles 
radiated from a solar eruption have a slower velocity than ultraviolet light waves produced by the 
eruption. This would account for the 18-hour or so time difference between a sid and an ionospheric 
storm. An ionospheric storm that is associated with sunspot activity may begin anytime from 2 days 
before an active sunspot crosses the central meridian of the sun until four days after it passes the central 
meridian. At times, however, active sunspots have crossed the central region of the sun without any 
ionospheric storms occurring. Conversely, ionospheric storms have occurred when there were no visible 
spots on the sun and no preceding sid. As you can see, some correlation between ionospheric storms, sid, 
and sunspot activity is possible, but there are no hard and fast rules. Ionospheric storms can occur 
suddenly without warning. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The most prominent effects of ionospheric storms are a turbulent ionosphere and very erratic sky 
wave propagation. Critical frequencies are lower than normal, particularly for the F2 layer. Ionospheric 
storms affect the higher F2 layer first, reducing its ion density. Lower layers are not appreciably affected 
by the storms unless the disturbance is great. The practical effect of ionospheric storms is that the range of </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FREQUENCY-SELECTION-CONSIDERATIONS-2-32-">FREQUENCY SELECTION CONSIDERATIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Up to this point, we have covered various factors that control the propagation of radio waves through 
the ionosphere, such as the structure of the ionosphere, the incidence angle of radio waves, operating 
frequencies, etc. There is a very good reason for studying radio wave propagation. You must have a 
thorough knowledge of radio wave propagation to exercise good judgment when you select transmitting 
and receiving antennas and operating frequencies. Selection of a suitable operating frequency (within the 
bounds of frequency allocations and availability) is of prime importance in maintaining reliable 
communications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For successful communications between any two specified locations at any given time of the day, 
there is a maximum frequency, a lowest frequency, and an optimum frequency that can be used. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Maximum Usable Frequency 
</h3><p class="paragraph">As we discussed earlier, the higher the frequency of a radio wave, the lower the rate of refraction by 
an ionized layer. Therefore, for a given angle of incidence and time of day, there is a maximum frequency 
that can be used for communications between two given locations. This frequency is known as the 
MAXIMUM USABLE FREQUENCY (muf). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Waves at frequencies above the muf are normally refracted so slowly that they return to Earth 
beyond the desired location, or pass on through the ionosphere and are lost. You should understand, 
however, that use of an established muf certainly does not guarantee successful communications between 
a transmitting site and a receiving site. Variations in the ionosphere may occur at any time and 
consequently raise or lower the predetermined muf. This is particularly true for radio waves being 
refracted by the highly variable F2 layer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The muf is highest around noon when ultraviolet light waves from the sun are the most intense. It 
then drops rather sharply as recombination begins to take place. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Lowest Usable Frequency 
</h3><p class="paragraph">As there is a maximum operating frequency that can be used for communications between two 
points, there is also a minimum operating frequency. This is known as the LOWEST USABLE 
FREQUENCY (luf). 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the frequency of a radio wave is lowered, the rate of refraction increases. So a wave whose 
frequency is below the established luf is refracted back to Earth at a shorter distance than desired, as 
shown in figure 2-23. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The transmission path that results from the rate of refraction is not the only factor that determines the 
luf. As a frequency is lowered, absorption of the radio wave increases. A wave whose frequency is too 
low is absorbed to such an extent that it is too weak for reception. Likewise, atmospheric noise is greater 
at lower frequencies; thus, a low-frequency radio wave may have an unacceptable signal-to-noise ratio. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For a given angle of incidence and set of ionospheric conditions, the luf for successful 
communications between two locations depends on the refraction properties of the ionosphere, absorption 
considerations, and the amount of atmospheric noise present. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Optimum Working Frequency 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Neither the muf nor the luf is a practical operating frequency. While radio waves at the luf can be 
refracted back to Earth at the desired location, the signal-to-noise ratio is still much lower than at the 
higher frequencies, and the probability of multipath propagation is much greater. Operating at or near the 
muf can result in frequent signal fading and dropouts when ionospheric variations alter the length of the 
transmission path. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The most practical operating frequency is one that you can rely on with the least amount of 
problems. It should be high enough to avoid the problems of multipath, absorption, and noise encountered 
at the lower frequencies; but not so high as to result in the adverse effects of rapid changes in the 
ionosphere. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A frequency that meets the above criteria has been established and is known as the OPTIMUM 
WORKING FREQUENCY. It is abbreviated "fot" from the initial letters of the French words for 
optimum working frequency, "frequence optimum de travail." The fot is roughly about 85 percent of the 
muf but the actual percentage varies and may be either considerably more or less than 85 percent.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Weather is an additional factor that affects the propagation of radio waves. In this section, we will 
explain how and to what extent the various weather phenomena affect wave propagation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Wind, air temperature, and water content of the atmosphere can combine in many ways. Certain 
combinations can cause radio signals to be heard hundreds of miles beyond the ordinary range of radio 
communications. Conversely, a different combination of factors can cause such attenuation of the signal 
that it may not be heard even over a normally satisfactory path. Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast 
rules on the effects of weather on radio transmissions since the weather is extremely complex and subject 
to frequent change. We will, therefore, limit our discussion on the effects of weather on radio waves to 
general terms. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PRECIPITATION-ATTENUATION-2-34-">PRECIPITATION ATTENUATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Calculating the effect of weather on radio wave propagation would be comparatively simple if there 
were no water or water vapor in the atmosphere. However, some form of water (vapor, liquid, or solid) is 
always present and must be considered in all calculations. Before we begin discussing the specific effects 
that individual forms of precipitation (rain, snow, fog) have on radio waves, you should understand that 
attenuation because of precipitation is generally proportionate to the frequency and wavelength of the 
radio wave. For example, rain has a pronounced effect on waves at microwave frequencies. However, rain 
hardly affects waves with long wavelengths (hf range and below). You can assume, then, that as the 
wavelength becomes shorter with increases in frequency, precipitation has an increasingly important 
attenuation effect on radio waves. Conversely, you can assume that as the wavelength becomes longer 
with decreases in frequency, precipitation has little attenuation effect. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Rain 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Attenuation because of raindrops is greater than attenuation because of other forms of precipitation. 
Attenuation may be caused by absorption, in which the raindrop, acting as a poor dielectric, absorbs 
power from the radio wave and dissipates the power by heat loss or by scattering (fig. 2-24). Raindrops 
cause greater attenuation by scattering than by absorption at frequencies above 100 megahertz. At 
frequencies above 6 gigahertz, attenuation by raindrop scatter is even greater. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Fog 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the discussion of attenuation, fog may be considered as another form of rain. Since fog remains 
suspended in the atmosphere, the attenuation is determined by the quantity of water per unit volume and 
by the size of the droplets. Attenuation because of fog is of minor importance at frequencies lower than 2 
gigahertz. However, fog can cause serious attenuation by absorption, at frequencies above 2 gigahertz. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Snow 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The scattering effect because of snow is difficult to compute because of irregular sizes and shapes of 
the flakes. While information on the attenuating effect of snow is limited, scientists assume that 
attenuation from snow is less than from rain falling at an equal rate. This assumption is borne out by the 
fact that the density of rain is eight times the density of snow. As a result, rain falling at 1 inch per hour 
would have more water per cubic inch than snow falling at the same rate. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Hail 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Attenuation by hail is determined by the size of the stones and their density. Attenuation of radio 
waves by scattering because of hailstones is considerably less than by rain. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TEMPERATURE-INVERSION-2-35-">TEMPERATURE INVERSION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Under normal atmospheric conditions, the warmest air is found near the surface of the Earth. The air 
gradually becomes cooler as altitude increases. At times, however, an unusual situation develops in which 
layers of warm air are formed above layers of cool air. This condition is known as TEMPERATURE 
INVERSION. These temperature inversions cause channels, or ducts, of cool air to be sandwiched 
between the surface of the Earth and a layer of warm air, or between two layers of warm air. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If a transmitting antenna extends into such a duct of cool air, or if the radio wave enters the duct at a 
very low angle of incidence, vhf and uhf transmissions may be propagated far beyond normal 
line-of-sight distances. When ducts are present as a result of temperature inversions, good reception of 
vhf and uhf television signals from a station located hundreds of miles away is not unusual. These long </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

sudden change in density when a radio wave enters the warm air above a duct causes the wave to be 
refracted back toward Earth. When the wave strikes the Earth or a warm layer below the duct, it is again 
reflected or refracted upward and proceeds on through the duct with a multiple-hop type of action. An 
example of the propagation of radio waves by ducting is shown in figure 2-25.

</h2><p class="paragraph">As the lowest region of the Earth's atmosphere, the troposphere extends from the Earth's surface to a 
height of slightly over 7 miles. Virtually all weather phenomena occur in this region. Generally, the 
troposphere is characterized by a steady decrease in both temperature and pressure as height is increased. 
However, the many changes in weather phenomena cause variations in humidity and an uneven heating of 
the Earth's surface. As a result, the air in the troposphere is in constant motion. This motion causes small 
turbulences, or eddies, to be formed, as shown by the bouncing of aircraft entering turbulent areas of the 
atmosphere. These turbulences are most intense near the Earth's surface and gradually diminish with 
height. They have a refractive quality that permits the refracting or scattering of radio waves with short 
wavelengths. This scattering provides enhanced communications at higher frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Recall that in the relationship between frequency and wavelength, wavelength decreases as 
frequency increases and vice versa. Radio waves of frequencies below 30 megahertz normally have 
wavelengths longer than the size of weather turbulences. These radio waves are, therefore, affected very 
little by the turbulences. On the other hand, as the frequency increases into the vhf range and above, the 
wavelengths decrease in size, to the point that they become subject to tropospheric scattering. The usable 
frequency range for tropospheric scattering is from about 100 megahertz to 10 gigahertz. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TROPOSPHERIC-SCATTERING-2-37-">TROPOSPHERIC SCATTERING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">When a radio wave passing through the troposphere meets a turbulence, it makes an abrupt change in 
velocity. This causes a small amount of the energy to be scattered in a forward direction and returned to 
Earth at distances beyond the horizon. This phenomenon is repeated as the radio wave meets other 
turbulences in its path. The total received signal is an accumulation of the energy received from each of 
the turbulences. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This scattering mode of propagation enables vhf and uhf signals to be transmitted far beyond the 
normal line-of-sight. To better understand how these signals are transmitted over greater distances, you 
must first consider the propagation characteristics of the space wave used in vhf and uhf line-of-sight 
communications. When the space wave is transmitted, it undergoes very little attenuation within the 
line-of-sight horizon. When it reaches the horizon, the wave is diffracted and follows the Earth's 
curvature. Beyond the horizon, the rate of attenuation increases very rapidly and signals soon become 
very weak and unusable. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Tropospheric scattering, on the other hand, provides a usable signal at distances beyond the point 
where the diffracted space wave drops to an unusable level. This is because of the height at which 
scattering takes place. The turbulence that causes the scattering can be visualized as a relay station located 
above the horizon; it receives the transmitted energy and then reradiates it in a forward direction to some 
point beyond the line-of-sight distance. A high gain receiving antenna aimed toward this scattered energy 
can then capture it. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnitude of the received signal depends on the number of turbulences causing scatter in the 
desired direction and the gain of the receiving antenna. The scatter area used for tropospheric scatter is 
known as the scatter volume. The angle at which the receiving antenna must be aimed to capture the 
scattered energy is called the scatter angle. The scatter volume and scatter angle are shown in figure 2-26. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The signal take-off angle (transmitting antenna's angle of radiation) determines the height of the 
scatter volume and the size of the scatter angle. A low signal take-off angle produces a low scatter 
volume, which in turn permits a receiving antenna that is aimed at a low angle to the scatter volume to 
capture the scattered energy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the signal take-off angle is increased, the height of the scatter volume is increased. When this 
occurs, the amount of received energy decreases. There are two reasons for this: (1) scatter angle </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

height. As the distance between the transmitting and receiving antennas is increased, the height of the 
scatter volume must also be increased. The received signal level, therefore, decreases as circuit distance is 
increased. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The tropospheric region that contributes most strongly to tropospheric scatter propagation lies near 
the midpoint between the transmitting and receiving antennas and just above the radio horizon of the 
antennas. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since tropospheric scatter depends on turbulence in the atmosphere, changes in atmospheric 
conditions have an effect on the strength of the received signal. Both daily and seasonal variations in 
signal strength occur as a result of changes in the atmosphere. These variations are called long-term 
fading. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to long-term fading, the tropospheric scatter signal often is characterized by very rapid 
fading because of multipath propagation. Since the turbulent condition is constantly changing, the path 
lengths and individual signal levels are also changing, resulting in a rapidly changing signal. Although the 
signal level of the received signal is constantly changing, the average signal level is stable; therefore, no 
complete fade out occurs. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another characteristic of a tropospheric scatter signal is its relatively low power level. Since very 
little of the scattered energy is reradiated toward the receiver, the efficiency is very low and the signal 
level at the final receiver point is low. Initial input power must be high to compensate for the low 
efficiency in the scatter volume. This is accomplished by using high-power transmitters and high-gain 
antennas, which concentrate the transmitted power into a beam, thus increasing the intensity of energy of 
each turbulence in the volume. The receiver must also be very sensitive to detect the low-level signals.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A TRANSMISSION LINE is a device designed to guide electrical energy from one point to another.
It is used, for example, to transfer the output rf energy of a transmitter to an antenna. This energy will not
travel through normal electrical wire without great losses. Although the antenna can be connected directly
to the transmitter, the antenna is usually located some distance away from the transmitter. On board ship,</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

transmission line is used to connect the transmitter and the antenna.
</p><p class="paragraph">The transmission line has a single purpose for both the transmitter and the antenna. This purpose is
to transfer the energy output of the transmitter to the antenna with the least possible power loss. How well
this is done depends on the special physical and electrical characteristics (impedance and resistance) of
the transmission line.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TERMINOLOGY-3-2-">TERMINOLOGY
</h2><p class="paragraph">All transmission lines have two ends (see figure 3-1). The end of a two-wire transmission line
connected to a source is ordinarily called the INPUT END or the GENERATOR END. Other names
given to this end are TRANSMITTER END, SENDING END, and SOURCE. The other end of the line is
called the OUTPUT END or RECEIVING END. Other names given to the output end are LOAD END
and SINK.
</p><p class="paragraph">You can describe a transmission line in terms of its impedance. The ratio of voltage to current
(Ein/Iin) at the input end is known as the INPUT IMPEDANCE (Zin). This is the impedance presented to
the transmitter by the transmission line and its load, the antenna. The ratio of voltage to current at the
output (Eout/Iout) end is known as the OUTPUT IMPEDANCE (Zout). This is the impedance presented to
the load by the transmission line and its source. If an infinitely long transmission line could be used, the
ratio of voltage to current at any point on that transmission line would be some particular value of
impedance. This impedance is known as the CHARACTERISTIC IMPEDANCE.

</p><p class="paragraph">The five types of transmission mediums that we will discuss in this chapter include
PARALLEL-LINE, TWISTED PAIR, SHIELDED PAIR, COAXIAL LINE, and WAVEGUIDES. The
use of a particular line depends, among other things, on the applied frequency, the power-handling
capabilities, and the type of installation.
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: In the following paragraphs, we will mention LOSSES several times. We will discuss these
losses more thoroughly under "LOSSES IN TRANSMISSION LINES."
</p><h3 class="subsection">Two-Wire Open Line
</h3><p class="paragraph">One type of parallel line is the TWO-WIRE OPEN LINE illustrated in figure 3-2. This line consists
of two wires that are generally spaced from 2 to 6 inches apart by insulating spacers. This type of line is
most often used for power lines, rural telephone lines, and telegraph lines. It is sometimes used as a
transmission line between a transmitter and an antenna or between an antenna and a receiver. An
advantage of this type of line is its simple construction. The principal disadvantages of this type of line
are the high radiation losses and electrical noise pickup because of the lack of shielding. Radiation losses
are produced by the changing fields created by the changing current in each conductor.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another type of parallel line is the TWO-WIRE RIBBON (TWIN LEAD) illustrated in figure 3-3.
This type of transmission line is commonly used to connect a television receiving antenna to a home
television set. This line is essentially the same as the two-wire open line except that uniform spacing is
assured by embedding the two wires in a low-loss dielectric, usually polyethylene. Since the wires are
embedded in the thin ribbon of polyethylene, the dielectric space is partly air and partly polyethylene.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Twisted Pair
</h3><p class="paragraph">The TWISTED PAIR transmission line is illustrated in figure 3-4. As the name implies, the line
consists of two insulated wires twisted together to form a flexible line without the use of spacers. It is not
used for transmitting high frequency because of the high dielectric losses that occur in the rubber
insulation. When the line is wet, the losses increase greatly.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Shielded Pair
</h3><p class="paragraph">The SHIELDED PAIR, shown in figure 3-5, consists of parallel conductors separated from each
other and surrounded by a solid dielectric. The conductors are contained within a braided copper tubing
that acts as an electrical shield. The assembly is covered with a rubber or flexible composition coating
that protects the line from moisture and mechanical damage. Outwardly, it looks much like the power
cord of a washing machine or refrigerator.
</p><p class="paragraph">The principal advantage of the shielded pair is that the conductors are balanced to ground; that is, the
capacitance between the wires is uniform throughout the length of the line. This balance is due to the
uniform spacing of the grounded shield that surrounds the wires along their entire length. The braided
copper shield isolates the conductors from stray magnetic fields.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Coaxial Lines
</h3><p class="paragraph">There are two types of COAXIAL LINES, RIGID (AIR) COAXIAL LINE and FLEXIBLE (SOLID)
COAXIAL LINE. The physical construction of both types is basically the same; that is, each contains two
concentric conductors.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">3-5
</p><p class="paragraph">The rigid coaxial line consists of a central, insulated wire (inner conductor) mounted inside a tubular
outer conductor. This line is shown in figure 3-6. In some applications, the inner conductor is also tubular.
The inner conductor is insulated from the outer conductor by insulating spacers or beads at regular
intervals. The spacers are made of Pyrex, polystyrene, or some other material that has good insulating
characteristics and low dielectric losses at high frequencies.
</p><p class="paragraph">The chief advantage of the rigid line is its ability to minimize radiation losses. The electric and
magnetic fields in a two-wire parallel line extend into space for relatively great distances and radiation
losses occur. However, in a coaxial line no electric or magnetic fields extend outside of the outer
conductor. The fields are confined to the space between the two conductors, resulting in a perfectly
shielded coaxial line. Another advantage is that interference from other lines is reduced.
</p><p class="paragraph">The rigid line has the following disadvantages: (1) it is expensive to construct; (2) it must be kept dry
to prevent excessive leakage between the two conductors; and (3) although high-frequency losses are
somewhat less than in previously mentioned lines, they are still excessive enough to limit the practical
length of the line.
</p><p class="paragraph">Leakage caused by the condensation of moisture is prevented in some rigid line applications by the
use of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, helium, or argon. It is pumped into the dielectric space of the line at
a pressure that can vary from 3 to 35 pounds per square inch. The inert gas is used to dry the line when it
is first installed and pressure is maintained to ensure that no moisture enters the line.
</p><p class="paragraph">Flexible coaxial lines (figure 3-7) are made with an inner conductor that consists of flexible wire
insulated from the outer conductor by a solid, continuous insulating material. The outer conductor is made
of metal braid, which gives the line flexibility. Early attempts at gaining flexibility involved using rubber
insulators between the two conductors. However, the rubber insulators caused excessive losses at high
frequencies.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Because of the high-frequency losses associated with rubber insulators, polyethylene plastic was
developed to replace rubber and eliminate these losses. Polyethylene plastic is a solid substance that
remains flexible over a wide range of temperatures. It is unaffected by seawater, gasoline, oil, and most
other liquids that may be found aboard ship. The use of polyethylene as an insulator results in greater
high-frequency losses than the use of air as an insulator. However, these losses are still lower than the
losses associated with most other solid dielectric materials.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Waveguides
</h3><p class="paragraph">The WAVEGUIDE is classified as a transmission line. However, the method by which it transmits
energy down its length differs from the conventional methods. Waveguides are cylindrical, elliptical, or
rectangular (cylindrical and rectangular shapes are shown in figure 3-8). The rectangular waveguide is
used more frequently than the cylindrical waveguide.
</p><p class="paragraph">The term waveguide can be applied to all types of transmission lines in the sense that they are all
used to guide energy from one point to another. However, usage has generally limited the term to mean a
hollow metal tube or a dielectric transmission line. In this chapter, we use the term waveguide only to
mean "hollow metal tube." It is interesting to note that the transmission of electromagnetic energy along a
waveguide travels at a velocity somewhat slower than electromagnetic energy traveling through free
space.
</p><p class="paragraph">A waveguide may be classified according to its cross section (rectangular, elliptical, or circular), or
according to the material used in its construction (metallic or dielectric). Dielectric waveguides are</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">seldom used because the dielectric losses for all known dielectric materials are too great to transfer the
electric and magnetic fields efficiently.
</p><p class="paragraph">The installation of a complete waveguide transmission system is somewhat more difficult than the
installation of other types of transmission lines. The radius of bends in the waveguide must measure
greater than two wavelengths at the operating frequency of the equipment to avoid excessive attenuation.
The cross section must remain uniform around the bend. These requirements hamper installation in
confined spaces. If the waveguide is dented, or if solder is permitted to run inside the joints, the
attenuation of the line is greatly increased. Dents and obstructions in the waveguide also reduce its
breakdown voltage, thus limiting the waveguide’s power-handling capability because of possible arc over.
Great care must be exercised during installation; one or two carelessly made joints can seriously inhibit
the advantage of using the waveguide.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The discussion of transmission lines so far has not directly addressed LINE LOSSES; actually some
line losses occur in all lines. Line losses may be any of three types—COPPER, DIELECTRIC, and
RADIATION or INDUCTION LOSSES.
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: Transmission lines are sometimes referred to as rf lines. In this text the terms are used
interchangeably.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Copper Losses
</h3><p class="paragraph">One type of copper loss is I2R LOSS. In rf lines the resistance of the conductors is never equal to
zero. Whenever current flows through one of these conductors, some energy is dissipated in the form of
heat. This heat loss is a POWER LOSS. With copper braid, which has a resistance higher than solid
tubing, this power loss is higher.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another type of copper loss is due to SKIN EFFECT. When dc flows through a conductor, the
movement of electrons through the conductor's cross section is uniform. The situation is somewhat
different when ac is applied. The expanding and collapsing fields about each electron encircle other
electrons. This phenomenon, called SELF INDUCTION, retards the movement of the encircled electrons.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The flux density at the center is so great that electron movement at this point is reduced. As frequency is
increased, the opposition to the flow of current in the center of the wire increases. Current in the center of
the wire becomes smaller and most of the electron flow is on the wire surface. When the frequency
applied is 100 megahertz or higher, the electron movement in the center is so small that the center of the
wire could be removed without any noticeable effect on current. You should be able to see that the
effective cross-sectional area decreases as the frequency increases. Since resistance is inversely
proportional to the cross-sectional area, the resistance will increase as the frequency is increased. Also,
since power loss increases as resistance increases, power losses increase with an increase in frequency
because of skin effect.
</p><p class="paragraph">Copper losses can be minimized and conductivity increased in an rf line by plating the line with
silver. Since silver is a better conductor than copper, most of the current will flow through the silver layer.
The tubing then serves primarily as a mechanical support.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Dielectric Losses
</h3><p class="paragraph">DIELECTRIC LOSSES result from the heating effect on the dielectric material between the
conductors. Power from the source is used in heating the dielectric. The heat produced is dissipated into
the surrounding medium. When there is no potential difference between two conductors, the atoms in the
dielectric material between them are normal and the orbits of the electrons are circular. When there is a
potential difference between two conductors, the orbits of the electrons change. The excessive negative
charge on one conductor repels electrons on the dielectric toward the positive conductor and thus distorts
the orbits of the electrons. A change in the path of electrons requires more energy, introducing a power
loss.
</p><p class="paragraph">The atomic structure of rubber is more difficult to distort than the structure of some other dielectric
materials. The atoms of materials, such as polyethylene, distort easily. Therefore, polyethylene is often
used as a dielectric because less power is consumed when its electron orbits are distorted.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Radiation and Induction Losses
</h3><p class="paragraph">RADIATION and INDUCTION LOSSES are similar in that both are caused by the fields
surrounding the conductors. Induction losses occur when the electromagnetic field about a conductor cuts
through any nearby metallic object and a current is induced in that object. As a result, power is dissipated
in the object and is lost.
</p><p class="paragraph">Radiation losses occur because some magnetic lines of force about a conductor do not return to the
conductor when the cycle alternates. These lines of force are projected into space as radiation and this
results in power losses. That is, power is supplied by the source, but is not available to the load.
</p><p class="question"> Q13. What are the three types of line losses associated with transmission lines?
 Q14. Losses caused by skin effect and the I 2 R (power) loss are classified as what type of loss?

</p><p class="paragraph">A transmission line is electrically long when its physical length is long compared to a quarter-
wavelength of the energy it is to carry. You must understand that the terms "short" and "long" are relative
ones. For example, a line that has a physical length of 3 meters (approximately 10 feet) is considered
quite short electrically if it transmits a radio frequency of 30 kilohertz. On the other hand, the same
transmission line is considered electrically long if it transmits a frequency of 30,000 megahertz.
</p><p class="paragraph">To show the difference in physical and electrical lengths of the lines mentioned above, compute the
wavelength of the two frequencies, taking the 30-kilohertz example first:

the 3-meter line is electrically very long for a frequency of 30,000 megahertz.
</p><p class="paragraph">When power is applied to a very short transmission line, practically all of it reaches the load at the
output end of the line. This very short transmission line is usually considered to have practically no
electrical properties of its own, except for a small amount of resistance.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

are electrically long (because of the distance from transmitter to antenna), the properties of such lines
must be considered. Frequently, the voltage necessary to drive a current through a long line is
considerably greater than the amount that can be accounted for by the impedance of the load in series with
the resistance of the line.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TRANSMISSION-LINE-THEORY-3-10-">TRANSMISSION LINE THEORY
</h2><p class="paragraph">The electrical characteristics of a two-wire transmission line depend primarily on the construction of
the line. The two-wire line acts like a long capacitor. The change of its capacitive reactance is noticeable
as the frequency applied to it is changed. Since the long conductors have a magnetic field about them
when electrical energy is being passed through them, they also exhibit the properties of inductance. The
values of inductance and capacitance presented depend on the various physical factors that we discussed
earlier. For example, the type of line used, the dielectric in the line, and the length of the line must be
considered. The effects of the inductive and capacitive reactances of the line depend on the frequency
applied. Since no dielectric is perfect, electrons manage to move from one conductor to the other through
the dielectric. Each type of two-wire transmission line also has a conductance value. This conductance
value represents the value of the current flow that may be expected through the insulation. If the line is
uniform (all values equal at each unit length), then one small section of the line may represent several
feet. This illustration of a two-wire transmission line will be used throughout the discussion of
transmission lines; but, keep in mind that the principles presented apply to all transmission lines. We will
explain the theories using LUMPED CONSTANTS and DISTRIBUTED CONSTANTS to further
simplify these principles.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LUMPED-CONSTANTS-3-10-">LUMPED CONSTANTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">A transmission line has the properties of inductance, capacitance, and resistance just as the more
conventional circuits have. Usually, however, the constants in conventional circuits are lumped into a
single device or component. For example, a coil of wire has the property of inductance. When a certain
amount of inductance is needed in a circuit, a coil of the proper dimensions is inserted. The inductance of
the circuit is lumped into the one component. Two metal plates separated by a small space, can be used to
supply the required capacitance for a circuit. In such a case, most of the capacitance of the circuit is
lumped into this one component. Similarly, a fixed resistor can be used to supply a certain value of circuit
resistance as a lumped sum. Ideally, a transmission line would also have its constants of inductance,
capacitance, and resistance lumped together, as shown in figure 3-9. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

transmission line and cannot be distinguished separately. The amount of inductance, capacitance, and
resistance depends on the length of the line, the size of the conducting wires, the spacing between the
wires, and the dielectric (air or insulating medium) between the wires. The following paragraphs will be
useful to you as you study distributed constants on a transmission line.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Inductance of a Transmission Line
</h3><p class="paragraph">When current flows through a wire, magnetic lines of force are set up around the wire. As the current
increases and decreases in amplitude, the field around the wire expands and collapses accordingly. The
energy produced by the magnetic lines of force collapsing back into the wire tends to keep the current
flowing in the same direction. This represents a certain amount of inductance, which is expressed in
microhenrys per unit length. Figure 3-10 illustrates the inductance and magnetic fields of a transmission
line.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The distributed constants of resistance, inductance, and capacitance are basic properties common to
all transmission lines and exist whether or not any current flow exists. As soon as current flow and
voltage exist in a transmission line, another property becomes quite evident. This is the presence of an
electromagnetic field, or lines of force, about the wires of the transmission line. The lines of force
themselves are not visible; however, understanding the force that an electron experiences while in the
field of these lines is very important to your understanding of energy transmission.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two kinds of fields; one is associated with voltage and the other with current. The field
associated with voltage is called the ELECTRIC (E) FIELD. It exerts a force on any electric charge
placed in it. The field associated with current is called a MAGNETIC (H) FIELD, because it tends to
exert a force on any magnetic pole placed in it. Figure 3-14 illustrates the way in which the E fields and H
fields tend to orient themselves between conductors of a typical two-wire transmission line. The
illustration shows a cross section of the transmission lines. The E field is represented by solid lines and
the H field by dotted lines. The arrows indicate the direction of the lines of force. Both fields normally
exist together and are spoken of collectively as the electromagnetic field.

when the source impedance is matched to the load impedance. This fact is very important in the study of
transmission lines and antennas. If the characteristic impedance of the transmission line and the load
impedance are equal, energy from the transmitter will travel down the transmission line to the antenna
with no power loss caused by reflection.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Definition and Symbols
</h3><p class="paragraph">Every transmission line possesses a certain CHARACTERISTIC IMPEDANCE, usually designated
as Z0. Z0 is the ratio of E to I at every point along the line. If a load equal to the characteristic impedance
is placed at the output end of any length of line, the same impedance will appear at the input terminals of
the line. The characteristic impedance is the only value of impedance for any given type and size of line
that acts in this way. The characteristic impedance determines the amount of current that can flow when a
given voltage is applied to an infinitely long line. Characteristic impedance is comparable to the
resistance that determines the amount of current that flows in a dc circuit.

</p><p class="paragraph">The impedance presented to the input terminals of the transmission line is not merely the resistance
of the wire in series with the impedance of the load. The effects of series inductance and shunt
capacitance of the line itself may overshadow the resistance, and even the load, as far as the input
terminals are concerned.
</p><p class="paragraph">To find the input impedance of a transmission line, determine the impedance of a single section of
line. The impedance between points K and L, in view B of figure 3-16, can be calculated by the use of
series-parallel impedance formulas, provided the impedance across points M and N is known. But since
this section is merely one small part of a longer line, another similar section is connected to points M and
N. Again, the impedance across points K and L of the two sections can be calculated, provided the
impedance of the third section is known. This process of adding one section to another can be repeated
endlessly. The addition of each section produces an impedance across points K and L of a new and lower
value. However, after many sections have been added, each successive added section has less and less
effect on the impedance across points K and L. If sections are added to the line endlessly, the line is
infinitely long, and a certain finite value of impedance across points K and L is finally reached.
</p><p class="paragraph">In this discussion of transmission lines, the effect of conductance (G) is minor compared to that of
inductance (L) and capacitance (C), and is frequently neglected. In figure 3-16, view C, G is omitted and
the inductance and resistance of each line can be considered as one line.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let us assume that the sections of view C continue to the right with an infinite number of sections.
When an infinite number of sections extends to the right, the impedance appearing across K and L is Z0.
If the line is cut at R and S, an infinite number of sections still extends to the right since the line is endless
in that direction. Therefore, the impedance now appearing across points R and S is also Z0, as illustrated
in view D. You can see that if only the first three sections are taken and a load impedance of Z0 is
connected across points R and S, the impedance across the input terminals K and L is still Z0. The line
continues to act as an infinite line. This is illustrated in view E.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-17, view A, illustrates how the characteristic impedance of an infinite line can be
calculated. Resistors are added in series parallel across terminals K and L in eight steps, and the resultant
impedances are noted. In step 1 the impedance is infinite; in step 2 the impedance is 110 ohms. In step 3
the impedance becomes 62.1 ohms, a change of 47.9 ohms. In step 4 the impedance is 48.5 ohms, a
change of only 13.6 ohms. The resultant changes in impedance from each additional increment become
progressively smaller. Eventually, practically no change in impedance results from further additions to the
line. The total impedance of the line at this point is said to be at its characteristic impedance; which, in
this case, is 37 ohms. This means that an infinite line constructed as indicated in step 8 could be
effectively replaced by a 37-ohm resistor. View B shows a 37-ohm resistor placed in the line at various
points to replace the infinite line of step 8 in view A. There is no change in total impedance.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

VOLTAGE CHANGE ALONG A TRANSMISSION LINE
</p><p class="paragraph">Let us summarize what we have just discussed. In an electric circuit, energy is stored in electric and
magnetic fields. These fields must be brought to the load to transmit that energy. At the load, energy
contained in the fields is converted to the desired form of energy.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Transmission of Energy
</h3><p class="paragraph">When the load is connected directly to the source of energy, or when the transmission line is short,
problems concerning current and voltage can be solved by applying Ohm’s law. When the transmission
line becomes long enough so the time difference between a change occurring at the generator and the
change appearing at the load becomes appreciable, analysis of the transmission line becomes important.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Dc Applied to a Transmission Line
</h3><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-18, a battery is connected through a relatively long two-wire transmission line to a load at
the far end of the line. At the instant the switch is closed, neither current nor voltage exists on the line.
When the switch is closed, point A becomes a positive potential, and point B becomes negative. These
points of difference in potential move down the line. However, as the initial points of potential leave
points A and B, they are followed by new points of difference in potential which the battery adds at A and
B. This is merely saying that the battery maintains a constant potential difference between points A and
B. A short time after the switch is closed, the initial points of difference in potential have reached points
A’ and B’; the wire sections from points A to A’ and points B to B’ are at the same potential as A and B,
respectively. The points of charge are represented by plus (+) and minus (-) signs along the wires. The
directions of the currents in the wires are represented by the arrowheads on the line, and the direction of
travel is indicated by an arrow below the line. Conventional lines of force represent the electric field that
exists between the opposite kinds of charge on the wire sections from A to A’ and B to B’. Crosses (tails
of arrows) indicate the magnetic field created by the electric field moving down the line. The moving
electric field and the accompanying magnetic field constitute an electromagnetic wave that is moving
from the generator (battery) toward the load. This wave travels at approximately the speed of light in free
space. The energy reaching the load is equal to that developed at the battery (assuming there are no losses

voltage. Thus a voltage wave is traveling along the line. Beyond the wavefront, the line is uncharged.
Since the line is infinitely long, there will always be more capacitors to be charged, and current will not
stop flowing. Thus current will flow indefinitely in the line.

This voltage charges each capacitor, in turn, through the preceding inductor. Since Zi equals Z 0, one-half
the applied voltage will appear across the internal battery impedance, Zi, and one-half across the
impedance of the line, Z0. Each capacitor is then charged to E/2 (view B). When the last capacitor in the
line is charged, there is no voltage across the last inductor and current flow through the last inductor
stops. With no current flow to maintain it, the magnetic field in the last inductor collapses and forces
current to continue to flow in the same direction into the last capacitor. Because the direction of current
has not changed, the capacitor charges in the same direction, thereby increasing the charge in the
capacitor. Since the energy in the magnetic field equals the energy in the capacitor, the energy transfer to
the capacitor doubles the voltage across the capacitor. The last capacitor is now charged to E volts and the

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TERMINATING-A-TRANSMISSION-LINE-3-38-">TERMINATING A TRANSMISSION LINE
</h2><p class="paragraph">A transmission line is either NONRESONANT or RESONANT. First, let us define the terms
nonresonant lines and resonant lines. A nonresonant line is a line that has no standing waves of current
and voltage. A resonant line is a line that has standing waves of current and voltage.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Nonresonant Lines
</h3><p class="paragraph">A nonresonant line is either infinitely long or terminated in its characteristic impedance. Since no
reflections occur, all the energy traveling down the line is absorbed by the load which terminates the line.
Since no standing waves are present, this type of line is sometimes spoken of as a FLAT line. In addition,
because the load impedance of such a line is equal to Z0, no special tuning devices are required to effect a
maximum power transfer; hence, the line is also called an UNTUNED line.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Resonant Lines
</h3><p class="paragraph">A resonant line has a finite length and is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. Therefore
reflections of energy do occur. The load impedance is different from the Z0 of the line; therefore, the input
impedance may not be purely resistive but may have reactive components. Tuning devices are used to
eliminate the reactance and to bring about maximum power transfer from the source to the line.
Therefore, a resonant line is sometimes called a TUNED line. The line also may be used for a resonant or
tuned circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">A resonant line is sometimes said to be resonant at an applied frequency. This means that at one
frequency the line acts as a resonant circuit. It may act either as a high-resistive circuit (parallel resonant)
or as a low-resistive circuit (series resonant). The line may be made to act in this manner by either open-
or short-circuiting it at the output end and cutting it to some multiple of a quarter-wavelength.
</p><p class="paragraph">At the points of voltage maxima and minima on a short-circuited or open-circuited line, the line
impedance is resistive. On a short-circuited line, each point at an odd number of quarter-wavelengths
from the receiving end has a high impedance (figure 3-31, view A). If the frequency of the applied
voltage to the line is varied, this impedance decreases as the effective length of the line changes. This
variation is exactly the same as the change in the impedance of a parallel-resonant circuit when the
applied frequency is varied.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">At all even numbered quarter-wavelength points from the short circuit, the impedance is extremely
low. When the frequency of the voltage applied to the line is varied, the impedance at these points
increases just as the impedance of a series-resonant circuit varies when the frequency applied to it is
changed. The same is true for an open-ended line (figure 3-31, view B) except that the points of high and
low impedance are reversed.
</p><p class="paragraph">At this point let us review some of the characteristics of resonant circuits so we can see how resonant
line sections may be used in place of LC circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">A PARALLEL-RESONANT circuit has the following characteristics:
</p><p class="paragraph">• At resonance the impedance appears as a very high resistance. A loss-free circuit has infinite
impedance (an open circuit). Other than at resonance, the impedance decreases rapidly.
</p><p class="paragraph">• If the circuit is resonant at a point above the generator frequency (the generator frequency is too
low), more current flows through the coil than through the capacitor. This happens because XL
decreases with a decrease in frequency but XC increases.

</p><p class="paragraph">• If the circuit is resonant at a point below the generator frequency (the generator frequency is
too high), then XL is larger than XC and the circuit acts inductively.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the impedance a generator sees at the quarter-wave point in a shorted line is that of a parallel-
resonant circuit, a shorted quarter-wave- length of line may be used as a parallel-resonant circuit (figure
3-31, view C). An open quarter-wavelength of line may be used as a series-resonant circuit (view D). The
Q of such a resonant line is much greater than can be obtained with lumped capacitance and inductance.

The curves above the letters of various heights show the relative value of the impedances presented to the
generator for the various line lengths. The circuit symbols indicate the equivalent electrical circuits for the
transmission lines at each particular length. The standing waves of voltage and current are shown on each

acts as an inductance; and from 3/4 to 1 wavelength, it acts as a capacitance, and so on. The equivalent

capacitive reactance is equal to the Z0 of the line. Current and voltage are in phase when they arrive at the
end of the line, but in flowing through the capacitor and the characteristic impedance (Z0) connected in

</p><p class="paragraph">approaches an infinite value, ER increases and approaches Ei in value. When RL is smaller than Z0, ER has
a negative value. This means that the reflected voltage is of opposite polarity to the incident wave at the
termination of the line. As RL approaches zero, ER approaches Ei in value. The smaller the value of ER, the
smaller is the peak amplitude of the standing waves and the higher are the minimum values.
</p><h3 class="subsection">TERMINATION IN A RESISTANCE GREATER THAN Z0
</h3><p class="paragraph">When RL is greater than Z0, the end of the line is somewhat like an open circuit; that is, standing
waves appear on the line. The voltage maximum appears at the end of the line and also at half-wave
intervals back from the end. The current is minimum (not zero) at the end of the line and maximum at the
odd quarter-wave points. Since part of the power in the incident wave is consumed by the load resistance,
the minimum voltage and current are less than for the standing waves on an open-ended line. Figure 3-34,
view G, illustrates the standing waves for this condition.
</p><h3 class="subsection">TERMINATION IN A RESISTANCE LESS THAN Z0
</h3><p class="paragraph">When RL is less than Z0, the termination appears as a short circuit. The standing waves are shown in
figure 3-34, view H. Notice that the line terminates in a current LOOP (peak) and a voltage NODE
(minimum). The values of the maximum and minimum voltage and current approach those for a shorted
line as the value of RL approaches zero.
</p><p class="paragraph">A line does not have to be any particular length to produce standing waves; however, it cannot be an
infinite line. Voltage and current must be reflected to produce standing waves. For reflection to occur, a
line must not be terminated in its characteristic impedance. Reflection occurs on lines terminated in
opens, shorts, capacitances, and inductances, because no energy is absorbed by the load. If the line is
terminated in a resistance not equal to the characteristic impedance of the line, some energy will be
absorbed and the rest will be reflected.
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltage and current relationships for open-ended and shorted lines are opposite to each other, as
shown in figure 3-34, views C and D. The points of maximum and minimum voltage and current are
determined from the output end of the line, because reflection always begins at that end.
</p><p class="question"> Q26. A nonresonant line is a line that has no standing waves of current and voltage on it and is
considered to be flat. Why is this true?
</p><p class="question"> Q27. On an open line, the voltage and impedance are maximum at what points on the line?
STANDING-WAVE RATIO
</p><p class="paragraph">The measurement of standing waves on a transmission line yields information about equipment
operating conditions. Maximum power is absorbed by the load when ZL = Z0. If a line has no standing
waves, the termination for that line is correct and maximum power transfer takes place.
</p><p class="paragraph">You have probably noticed that the variation of standing waves shows how near the rf line is to
being terminated in Z0. A wide variation in voltage along the length means a termination far from Z0. A
small variation means termination near Z
</p><p class="paragraph"> 0. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum is a
measure of the perfection of the termination of a line. This ratio is called the STANDING-WAVE RATIO
(swr) and is always expressed in whole numbers. For example, a ratio of 1:1 describes a line terminated in
its characteristic impedance (Z
</p><p class="paragraph"> 0).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Voltage Standing-Wave Ratio
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ratio of maximum voltage to minimum voltage on a line is called the VOLTAGE STANDING-
WAVE RATIO (vswr). Therefore:
</p><p class="paragraph">The vertical lines in the formula indicate that the enclosed quantities are absolute and that the two
values are taken without regard to polarity. Depending on the nature of the standing waves, the numerical
value of vswr ranges from a value of 1 (ZL = Z0, no standing waves) to an infinite value for theoretically
complete reflection. Since there is always a small loss on a line, the minimum voltage is never zero and
the vswr is always some finite value. However, if the vswr is to be a useful quantity, the power losses
along the line must be small in comparison to the transmitted power.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Power Standing-Wave Ratio
</h3><p class="paragraph">The square of the voltage standing-wave ratio is called the POWER STANDING-WAVE RATIO
(pswr). Therefore:
</p><p class="paragraph">This ratio is useful because the instruments used to detect standing waves react to the square of the
voltage. Since power is proportional to the square of the voltage, the ratio of the square of the maximum
and minimum voltages is called the power standing-wave ratio. In a sense, the name is misleading
because the power along a transmission line does not vary.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Current Standing-Wave Ratio
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ratio of maximum to minimum current along a transmission line is called CURRENT
STANDING-WAVE RATIO (iswr). Therefore:
</p><p class="paragraph">This ratio is the same as that for voltages. It can be used where measurements are made with loops
that sample the magnetic field along a line. It gives the same results as vswr measurements.

</h2><p class="paragraph">If you had been around in the early days of electronics, you would have considered an ANTENNA 
(AERIAL) to be little more than a piece of wire strung between two trees or upright poles. In those days, 
technicians assumed that longer antennas automatically provided better reception than shorter antennas. 
They also believed that a mysterious MEDIUM filled all space, and that an antenna used this medium to 
send and receive its energy. These two assumptions have since been discarded. Modern antennas have 
evolved to the point that highly directional, specially designed antennas are used to relay worldwide 
communications in space through the use of satellites and Earth station antennas (fig. 4-1). Present 
transmission theories are based on the assumption that space itself is the only medium necessary to 
propagate (transmit) radio energy. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A tremendous amount of knowledge and information has been gained about the design of antennas 
and radio-wave propagation. Still, many old-time technicians will tell you that when it comes to designing 
the length of an antenna, the best procedure is to perform all calculations and try out the antenna. If it 
doesn't work right, use a cut-and-try method until it does. Fortunately, enough information has been 
collected over the last few decades that it is now possible to predict the behavior of antennas. This chapter 
will discuss and explain the basic design and operation of antennas. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PRINCIPLES-OF-ANTENNA-RADIATION-4-2-">PRINCIPLES OF ANTENNA RADIATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">After an rf signal has been generated in a transmitter, some means must be used to radiate this signal 
through space to a receiver. The device that does this job is the antenna. The transmitter signal energy is 
sent into space by a TRANSMITTING ANTENNA; the rf signal is then picked up from space by a 
RECEIVING ANTENNA. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The rf energy is transmitted into space in the form of an electromagnetic field. As the traveling 
electromagnetic field arrives at the receiving antenna, a voltage is induced into the antenna (a conductor). 
The rf voltages induced into the receiving antenna are then passed into the receiver and converted back 
into the transmitted rf information. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The design of the antenna system is very important in a transmitting station. The antenna must be 
able to radiate efficiently so the power supplied by the transmitter is not wasted. An efficient transmitting 
antenna must have exact dimensions. The dimensions are determined by the transmitting frequencies. The 
dimensions of the receiving antenna are not critical for relatively low radio frequencies. However, as the 
frequency of the signal being received increases, the design and installation of the receiving antenna 
become more critical. An example of this is a television receiving antenna. If you raise it a few more 
inches from the ground or give a slight turn in direction, you can change a snowy blur into a clear picture. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The conventional antenna is a conductor, or system of conductors, that radiates or intercepts 
electromagnetic wave energy. An ideal antenna has a definite length and a uniform diameter, and is 
completely isolated in space. However, this ideal antenna is not realistic. Many factors make the design of 
an antenna for a communications system a more complex problem than you would expect. These factors 
include the height of the radiator above the earth, the conductivity of the earth below it, and the shape and 
dimensions of the antenna. All of these factors affect the radiated-field pattern of the antenna in space. 
Another problem in antenna design is that the radiation pattern of the antenna must be directed between 
certain angles in a horizontal or vertical plane, or both. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most practical transmitting antennas are divided into two basic classifications, HERTZ (half-wave) 
ANTENNAS and MARCONI (quarter-wave) ANTENNAS. Hertz antennas are generally installed some 
distance above the ground and are positioned to radiate either vertically or horizontally. Marconi antennas 
operate with one end grounded and are mounted perpendicular to the Earth or to a surface acting as a 
ground. Hertz antennas are generally used for frequencies above 2 megahertz. Marconi antennas are used

The distribution curve shows that most current flows in the center and none flows at the ends. The current

field. We discussed these fields in chapters 1 and 2. The two fields occur 90 degrees out of phase with 
each other. These fields add and produce a single electromagnetic field. The total energy in the radiated 
wave remains constant in space except for some absorption of energy by the Earth. However, as the wave 
advances, the energy spreads out over a greater area and, at any given point, decreases as the distance 
increases. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Various factors in the antenna circuit affect the radiation of these waves. In figure 4-5, for example, 
if an alternating current is applied at the A end of the length of wire from A to B, the wave will travel 
along the wire until it reaches the B end. Since the B end is free, an open circuit exists and the wave 
cannot travel farther. This is a point of high impedance. The wave bounces back (reflects) from this point 
of high impedance and travels toward the starting point, where it is again reflected. The energy of the 
wave would be gradually dissipated by the resistance of the wire of this back-and-forth motion 
(oscillation); however, each time it reaches the starting point, the wave is reinforced by an amount 
sufficient to replace the energy lost. This results in continuous oscillations of energy along the wire and a 
high voltage at the A end of the wire. These oscillations are applied to the antenna at a rate equal to the 
frequency of the rf voltage.

</p><p class="paragraph">Look at the current and voltage (charge) distribution on the antenna in figure 4-6. A maximum 
movement of electrons is in the center of the antenna at all times; therefore, the center of the antenna is at 
a low impedance. This condition is called a STANDING WAVE of current. The points of high current 
and high voltage are known as current and voltage LOOPS. The points of minimum current and minimum 
voltage are known as current and voltage NODES. View A shows a current loop and current nodes. View 
B shows voltage loops and a voltage node. View C shows the resultant voltage and current loops and 
nodes. The presence of standing waves describes the condition of resonance in an antenna. At resonance 
the waves travel back and forth in the antenna reinforcing each other and the electromagnetic waves are 
transmitted into space at maximum radiation. When the antenna is not at resonance, the waves tend to 
cancel each other and lose energy in the form of heat.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ANTENNA-CHARACTERISTICS-4-8-">ANTENNA CHARACTERISTICS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">You can define an antenna as a conductor or group of conductors used either for radiating 
electromagnetic energy into space or for collecting it from space. Electrical energy from the transmitter is 
converted into electromagnetic energy by the antenna and radiated into space. On the receiving end, 
electromagnetic energy is converted into electrical energy by the antenna and is fed into the receiver. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Fortunately, separate antennas seldom are required for both transmitting and receiving rf energy. 
Any antenna can transfer energy from space to its input receiver with the same efficiency that it transfers 
energy from the transmitter into space. Of course, this is assuming that the same frequency is used in both 
cases. This property of interchangeability of the same antenna for transmitting and receiving is known as 
antenna RECIPROCITY. Antenna reciprocity is possible because antenna characteristics are essentially 
the same for sending and receiving electromagnetic energy. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RECIPROCITY-OF-ANTENNAS-4-8-">RECIPROCITY OF ANTENNAS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In general, the various properties of an antenna apply equally, regardless of whether you use the 
antenna for transmitting or receiving. The more efficient a certain antenna is for transmitting, the more 
efficient it will be for receiving on the same frequency. Likewise, the directive properties of a given 
antenna also will be the same whether it is used for transmitting or receiving. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume, for example, that a certain antenna used with a transmitter radiates a maximum amount of 
energy at right angles to the axis of the antenna, as shown in figure 4-7, view A. Note the minimum 
amount of radiation along the axis of the antenna. Now, if this same antenna were used as a receiving 
antenna, as shown in view B, it would receive best in the same directions in which it produced maximum 
radiation; that is, at right angles to the axis of the antenna.

transmitting or receiving is GAIN. Some antennas are highly directional that is, more energy is 
propagated in certain directions than in others. The ratio between the amount of energy propagated in 
these directions compared to the energy that would be propagated if the antenna were not directional is 
known as its gain. When a transmitting antenna with a certain gain is used as a receiving antenna, it will 
also have the same gain for receiving. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-POLARIZATION-4-9-">POLARIZATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Let's review polarization briefly. In chapter 2 you learned that the radiation field is composed of 
electric and magnetic lines of force. These lines of force are always at right angles to each other. Their 
intensities rise and fall together, reaching their maximums 90 degrees apart. The electric field determines 
the direction of polarization of the wave. In a vertically polarized wave, the electric lines of force lie in a 
vertical direction. In a horizontally polarized wave, the electric lines of force lie in a horizontal direction. 
Circular polarization has the electric lines of force rotating through 360 degrees with every cycle of rf 
energy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The electric field was chosen as the reference field because the intensity of the wave is usually 
measured in terms of the electric field intensity (volts, millivolts, or microvolts per meter). When a 
single-wire antenna is used to extract energy from a passing radio wave, maximum pickup will result 
when the antenna is oriented in the same direction as the electric field. Thus a vertical antenna is used for 
the efficient reception of vertically polarized waves, and a horizontal antenna is used for the reception of 
horizontally polarized waves. In some cases the orientation of the electric field does not remain constant. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

vertical components of the field exist and the wave is said to have an elliptical polarization.

used as a receiving antenna. What term is used for this property? 
</p><p class="question">Q8. The direction of what field is used to designate the polarization of a wave? 
</p><p class="question">Q9. If a wave's electric lines of force rotate through 360 degrees with every cycle of rf energy, what is 
the polarization of this wave? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Polarization Requirements for Various Frequencies 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Ground-wave transmission is widely used at medium and low frequencies. Horizontal polarization 
cannot be used at these frequencies because the electric lines of force are parallel to and touch the earth. 
Since the earth acts as a fairly good conductor at low frequencies, it would short out the horizontal 
electric lines of force and prevent the radio wave from traveling very far. Vertical electric lines of force, 
on the other hand, are bothered very little by the earth. Therefore vertical polarization is used for 
ground-wave transmission, allowing the radio wave to travel a considerable distance along the ground 
surface with minimum attenuation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Sky-wave transmission is used at high frequencies. Either horizontal or vertical polarization can be 
used with sky-wave transmission because the sky wave arrives at the receiving antenna elliptically 
polarized. This is the result of the wave traveling obliquely through the Earth's magnetic field and striking 
the ionosphere. The radio wave is given a twisting motion as it strikes the ionosphere. Its orientation 
continues to change because of the unstable nature of the ionosphere. The relative amplitudes and phase 
differences between the horizontal and vertical components of the received wave also change. Therefore, 
the transmitting and receiving antennas can be mounted either horizontally or vertically. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Although either horizontally or vertically polarized antennas can be used for high frequencies, 
horizontally polarized antennas have certain advantages and are therefore preferred. One advantage is that 
vertically polarized interference signals, such as those produced by automobile ignition systems and 
electrical appliances, are minimized by horizontal polarization. Also, less absorption of radiated energy 
by buildings or wiring occurs when these antennas are used. Another advantage is that support structures 
for these antennas are of more convenient size than those for vertically polarized antennas. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For frequencies in the vhf or uhf range, either horizontal or vertical polarization is satisfactory. These 
radio waves travel directly from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna without entering the 
ionosphere. The original polarization produced at the transmitting antenna is maintained throughout the 
entire travel of the wave to the receiver. Therefore, if a horizontally polarized antenna is used for 
transmitting, a horizontally polarized antenna must be used for receiving. The requirements would be the 
same for a vertical transmitting and receiving antenna system. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For satellite communications, parallel frequencies can be used without interference by using 
polarized radiation. The system setup is shown in figure 4-8. One pair of satellite antennas is vertically 
polarized and another pair is horizontally polarized. Either vertically or horizontally polarized 
transmissions are received by the respective antenna and retransmitted in the same polarization. For 
example, transmissions may be made in the 3.7 to 3.74 GHz range on the vertical polarization path and in 
the 3.72 to 3.76 GHz range on the horizontal polarization path without adjacent frequency (co-channel) 
interference. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Advantages of Vertical Polarization 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Simple vertical antennas can be used to provide OMNIDIRECTIONAL (all directions) 
communication. This is an advantage when communications must take place from a moving vehicle. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In some overland communications, such as in vehicular installations, antenna heights are limited to 3 
meters (10 feet) or less. In such instances vertical polarization results in a stronger receiver signal than 
does horizontal polarization at frequencies up to about 50 megahertz. From approximately 50 to 100 
megahertz, vertical polarization results in a slightly stronger signal than does horizontal polarization with 
antennas at the same height. Above 100 megahertz, the difference in signal strength is negligible. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For transmission over bodies of water, vertical polarization is much better than horizontal 
polarization for antennas at the lower heights. As the frequency increases, the minimum antenna height 
decreases. At 30 megahertz, vertical polarization is better for antenna heights below about 91 meters (300 
feet); at 85 megahertz, antenna heights below 15 meters (50 feet); and still lower heights at the high 
frequencies. Therefore, at ordinary antenna mast heights of 12 meters (40 feet), vertical polarization is 
advantageous for frequencies less than about 100 megahertz. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radiation is somewhat less affected by reflections from aircraft flying over the transmission path 
when vertical polarization is used instead of horizontal polarization. With horizontal polarization, such 
reflections cause variations in received signal strength. This factor is important in locations where aircraft 
traffic is heavy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When vertical polarization is used, less interference is produced or picked up because of strong vhf 
and uhf broadcast transmissions (television and fm). This is because vhf and uhf transmissions use 
horizontal polarization. This factor is important when an antenna must be located in an urban area having 
several television and fm broadcast stations. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">A simple horizontal antenna is bi-directional. This characteristic is useful when you desire to 
minimize interference from certain directions. Horizontal antennas are less likely to pick up man-made 
interference, which ordinarily is vertically polarized. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When antennas are located near dense forests or among buildings, horizontally polarized waves 
suffer lower losses than vertically polarized waves, especially above 100 megahertz. Small changes in 
antenna locations do not cause large variations in the field intensity of horizontally polarized waves. 
When vertical polarization is used, a change of only a few meters in the antenna location may have a 
considerable effect on the received signal strength. This is the result of interference patterns that produce 
standing waves in space when spurious reflections from trees or buildings occur. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When simple antennas are used, the transmission line, which is usually vertical, is less affected by a 
horizontally mounted antenna. When the antenna is mounted at right angles to the transmission line and 
horizontal polarization is used, the line is kept out of the direct field of the antenna. As a result, the 
radiation pattern and electrical characteristics of the antenna are practically unaffected by the presence of 
the vertical transmission line.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADIATION-RESISTANCE-4-12-">RADIATION RESISTANCE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Radiated energy is the useful part of the transmitter's signal. However, it represents as much of a loss 
to the antenna as the energy lost in heating the antenna wire. In either case, the dissipated power is equal 
to I2R. In the case of heat losses, the R is real resistance. In the case of radiation, R is an assumed 
resistance; if this resistance were actually present, it would dissipate the same amount of power that the 
antenna takes to radiate the energy. This assumed resistance is referred to as the RADIATION 
RESISTANCE. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radiation resistance varies at different points on the antenna. This resistance is always measured at a 
current loop. For the antenna in free space, that is, entirely removed from any objects that might affect its 
operation, the radiation resistance is 73 ohms. A practical antenna located over a ground plane may have 
any value of radiation resistance from 0 to approximately 100 ohms. The exact value of radiation 
resistance depends on the height of the antenna above the ground. For most half-wave wire antennas, the 
radiation resistance is about 65 ohms. It will usually vary between 55 and 600 ohms for antennas 
constructed of rod or tubing. The actual value of radiation resistance, so long as it is 50 ohms or more, has 
little effect on the radiation efficiency of the antenna. This is because the ohmic resistance is about 1 ohm 
for conductors of large diameter. The ohmic resistance does not become important until the radiation 
resistance drops to a value less than 10 ohms. This may be the case when several antennas are coupled 
together.

ISOTROPIC RADIATION. We all know the Sun radiates energy in all directions. The energy radiated 
from the Sun measured at any fixed distance and from any angle will be approximately the same. Assume 
that a measuring device is moved around the Sun and stopped at the points indicated in figure 4-9 to make 
a measurement of the amount of radiation. At any point around the circle, the distance from the measuring 
device to the Sun is the same. The measured radiation will also be the same. The Sun is therefore 
considered an isotropic radiator.

the measured amount of radiation is 7 units at all points. We will then plot our measurements on two 
different types of graphs, rectangular- and polar-coordinate graphs. The RECTANGULAR-

radiation value of 7 units view B is measured at position 2. From position 2 on the horizontal axis, a 
dotted line is projected upwards that runs parallel to the vertical axis. From position 7 on the vertical axis, 
a line is projected to the right that runs parallel to the horizontal axis. The point where the two lines cross 
(INTERCEPT) represents a value of 7 radiation units at position 2. This is the only point on the graph that 
can represent this value. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see from the figure, the lines used to plot the point form a rectangle. For this reason, this 
type of plot is called a rectangular-coordinate graph. A new rectangle is formed for each different point 
plotted. In this example, the points plotted lie in a straight line extending from 7 units on the vertical scale 
to the projection of position 7 on the horizontal scale. This is the characteristic pattern in rectangular 
coordinates of an isotropic source of radiation.

</p><p class="paragraph">transferred from the rectangular-coordinate graph in view A to the polar-coordinate graph in view B. The 
scale of radiation values used in both graphs is identical, and the measurements taken are both the same. 
However, the shape of the pattern is drastically different. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at view B of figure 4-10 and assume that the center of the concentric circles is the Sun. Assume 
that a radius is drawn from the Sun (center of the circle) to position 0 of the circle. When you move to 
position 1, the radius moves to position 1; when you move to position 2, the radius also moves to position 
2, and so on. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The positions where a measurement was taken are marked as 0 through 7 on the graph. Note how the 
position of the radius indicates the actual direction from the source at which the measurement was taken. 
This is a distinct advantage over the rectangular-coordinate graph in which the position is indicated along 
a straight-line axis and has no physical relation to the actual direction of measurement. Now that we have 
a way to indicate the direction of measurement, we must devise a way to indicate the magnitude of the 
radiation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that the rotating axis is always drawn from the center of the graph to some position on the 
edge of the graph. As the axis moves toward the edge of the graph, it passes through a set of 
equally-spaced, concentric circles. In this example view B, they are numbered successively from 1 to 10 
from the center out. These circles are used to indicate the magnitude of the radiation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The advantages of the polar-coordinate graph are immediately evident. The source, which is at the 
center of the observation circles, is also at the center of the graph. By looking at a polar-coordinate plot of 
a radiation pattern, you can immediately see the direction and strength of radiation put out by the source. 
Therefore, the polar-coordinate graph is more useful than the rectangular-coordinate graph in plotting 
radiation patterns. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Anisotropic Radiation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Most radiators emit (radiate) stronger radiation in one direction than in another. A radiator such as 
this is referred to as ANISOTROPIC. An example of an anisotropic radiator is an ordinary flashlight. The 
beam of the flashlight lights only a portion of the space surrounding it. If a circle is drawn with the 
flashlight as the center, as shown in view B of figure 4-11, the radiated light can be measured at different 
positions around the circle. Again, as with the isotropic radiator, all positions are the same distance from 
the center, but at different angles. However, in this illustration the radiated light is measured at 16 
different positions on the circle. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Directly behind the flashlight (position 0) the radiation measured is minimum. Accordingly, a 0 
value is assigned to this position in the rectangular-coordinate graph (fig. 4-11, view A). This radiation 
remains at minimum until position 4 is reached. Between positions 4 and 6, the measuring device enters 
the flashlight beam. You can see this transition from darkness to brightness easily in view B. Radiation is 
fairly constant between positions 6 and 10. Maximum brightness occurs at position 8, which is directly in 
the path of the flashlight beam. From positions 10 to 12, the measuring device leaves the flashlight beam 
and the radiation measurement falls off sharply. At position 13 the radiation is again at 0 and stays at this 
value back to position 0. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radiation from a light source and radiation from an antenna are both forms of electromagnetic 
waves. Therefore, the measurement of radiation of an antenna follows the same basic procedure as that 
just described for the Sun and the flashlight. Before proceeding further with the study of antenna patterns, 
you should be sure you understand the methods used to graph the measured radiation (magnitude of the 
radiation). Study the rectangular- and polar-coordinate systems of plotting presented in the following

</p><p class="paragraph">The positions marked off on the two polar-coordinate graphs in figures 4-10 and 4-12 were selected 
and numbered arbitrarily. However, a standard method allows the positions around a source to be marked 
off so that one radiation pattern can easily be compared with another. This method is based on the fact 
that a circle has a radius of 360 degrees. The radius extending vertically from the center (position 0 in 
figure 4-10) is designated 0 degrees. At position 4 the radius is at a right angle to the 0-degree radius. 
Accordingly, the radius at position 4 is marked 90 degrees, position 8 is 180 degrees, position 12 is 270 
degrees, and position 16 is 360 degrees. The various radii drawn on the graph are all marked according to 
the angle each radius makes with the reference radius at 0 degrees. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The radiation pattern in figure 4-12 is obtained by using the same procedure that was used for (figure 
4-10, view B). The radiation measured at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 0. Position 5 measures approximately 
1 unit. This is marked on the graph and the rotating radius moves to position 6. At this position a reading 
of 5.5 units is taken. As before, this point is marked on the graph. The procedure is repeated around the 
circle and a reading is obtained from positions 6 through 11. At position 12 no radiation is indicated, and 
this continues on to position 16. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The polar-coordinate graph now shows a definite area enclosed by the radiation pattern. This pattern 
indicates the general direction of radiation from the source. The enclosed area is called a LOBE. Outside 
of this area, minimum radiation is emitted in any direction. For example, at position 2 the radiation is 0. 
Such a point is called a NULL. In real situations, some radiation is usually transmitted in all directions. 
Therefore, a null is used to indicate directions of minimum radiation. The pattern of figure 4-12 shows 
one lobe and one continuous null.

shortened), physically lengthening the antenna is not very practical. But you can achieve the same result 
by changing the electrical length of the antenna. To change the electrical length, you can insert either an 
inductor or a capacitor in series with the antenna. This is shown in figure 4-13, views A and B. Changing 
the electrical length by this method is known as LUMPED-IMPEDANCE TUNING, or LOADING. The 
electrical length of any antenna wire can be increased or decreased by loading. If the antenna is too short 
for the wavelength being used, it is resonant at a higher frequency than that at which it is being excited. 
Therefore, it offers a capacitive reactance at the excitation frequency. This capacitive reactance can be 
compensated for by introducing a lumped-inductive reactance, as shown in view A. Similarly, if the 
antenna is too long for the transmitting frequency, it offers an inductive reactance. Inductive reactance 
can be compensated for by introducing a lumped-capacitive reactance, as shown in view B. An antenna

antenna operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Nearly all antennas have been developed from two basic types, the Hertz and the Marconi. The basic 
Hertz antenna is 1/2 wavelength long at the operating frequency and is insulated from ground. It is often 
called a DIPOLE or a DOUBLET. The basic Marconi antenna is 1/4 wavelength long and is either 
grounded at one end or connected to a network of wires called a COUNTERPOISE. The ground or 
counterpoise provides the equivalent of an additional 1/4 wavelength, which is required for the antenna to 
resonate.

</h3><p class="paragraph">In the following discussion, the term DIPOLE is used to mean the basic half-wave antenna. The term 
DOUBLET is used to indicate an antenna that is very short compared with the wavelength of the 
operating frequency. Physically, it has the same shape as the dipole. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RADIATION PATTERN OF A DOUBLET.—The doublet is the simplest form of a practical 
antenna. Its radiation pattern can be plotted like the radiation pattern of the flashlight (fig. 4-12). Figure 
4-14 shows the development of vertical and horizontal patterns for a doublet. This in NOT a picture of the 
radiation, but three-dimensional views of the pattern itself. In three views the pattern resembles a 
doughnut. From the dimensions in these views, two types of polar-coordinate patterns can be drawn, 
horizontal and vertical. The HORIZONTAL PATTERN view A is derived from the solid pattern view C 
by slicing it horizontally. This produces view B, which is converted to the polar coordinates seen in view 
A. The horizontal pattern illustrates that the radiation is constant in any direction along the horizontal

perpendicular to the antenna axis. This type of radiation pattern is both NONDIRECTIONAL (in a 
horizontal plane) and DIRECTIONAL (in a vertical plane). 
</p><p class="paragraph">From a practical viewpoint, the doublet antenna can be mounted either vertically or horizontally. The 
doublet shown in figure 4-14 is mounted vertically, and the radiated energy spreads out about the antenna 
in every direction in the horizontal plane. Since ordinarily the horizontal plane is the useful plane, this 
arrangement is termed NONDIRECTIONAL. The directional characteristics of the antenna in other 
planes is ignored. If the doublet were mounted horizontally, it would have the effect of turning the pattern 
on edge, reversing the patterns given in figure 4-14. The antenna would then be directional in the 
horizontal plane. The terms "directional" and "nondirectional" are used for convenience in describing 
specific radiation patterns. A complete description always involves a figure in three dimensions, as in the 
radiation pattern of figure 4-14.

</p><p class="paragraph">RADIATION PATTERN OF A DIPOLE.—The radiation pattern of a dipole (fig. 4-15) is similar 
to that of the doublet (fig. 4-14). Increasing the length of the doublet to 1/2 wavelength has the effect of 
flattening out the radiation pattern. The radiation pattern in the horizontal plane of a dipole is a larger 
circle than that of the doublet. The vertical-radiation pattern lobes are no longer circular. They are 
flattened out and the radiation intensity is greater.

</h3><p class="paragraph">Voltage and current distribution for the half-wave antenna (shown in figure 4-16) is the same as that 
for the antenna discussed earlier in this chapter. A point closely related to the voltage and current 
distribution on an antenna is the method of feeding the transmitter output to the antenna. The simplest 
method of feeding energy to the half-wave antenna is to connect one end through a capacitor to the final 
output stage of the transmitter. This method is often called the END-FEED or VOLTAGE-FEED method. 
In this method the antenna is fed at a point of high voltage (the end). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Energy may also be fed to the half-wave antenna by dividing the antenna at its center and connecting 
the transmission line from the final transmitter output stage to the two center ends of the halved antenna. 
Since the antenna is now being fed at the center (a point of low voltage and high current), this type of feed 
is known as the CENTER-FEED or CURRENT-FEED method. The point of feed is important in 
determining the type of transmission line to be used.

between the radiator and the transmission line is often difficult. A convenient method of overcoming 
these difficulties is to use a FOLDED DIPOLE in place of the center-fed radiator. (See views A and B of 
figure 4-20). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A FOLDED DIPOLE is an ordinary half-wave antenna that has one or more additional conductors 
connected across its ends. Additional conductors are mounted parallel to the dipole elements at a distance 
equal to a very small fraction of a wavelength. Spacing of several inches is common. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The feed-point impedance can be further increased by using three or four properly spaced parallel 
conductors. Standard feed-line SPREADERS are used to maintain this spacing when required. In any 
folded dipole, the increase of impedance is the square of the number of conductors used in the radiator. 
Thus, a three-wire dipole has nine times (32) the feed-point impedance of a simple center-fed dipole. A 
second method of stepping up the impedance of a folded dipole is to use two conductors with different 
radii, as shown in view B.

</p><p class="paragraph">A DRIVEN element is similar to the dipole you have been studying and is connected directly to the 
transmission line. It obtains its power directly from the transmitter or, as a receiving antenna, it delivers 
the received energy directly to the receiver. A PARASITIC ELEMENT is located near the driven element 
from which it gets its power. It is placed close enough to the driven element to permit coupling. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A parasitic element is sometimes placed so it will produce maximum radiation (during transmission) 
from its associated driver. When it operates to reinforce energy coming from the driver toward itself, the 
parasitic element is referred to as a DIRECTOR. If a parasitic element is placed so it causes maximum 
energy radiation in a direction away from itself and toward the driven element, that parasitic element is 
called a REFLECTOR. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If all of the elements in an array are driven, the array is referred to as a DRIVEN ARRAY 
(sometimes as a CONNECTED ARRAY). If one or more elements are parasitic, the entire system usually 
is considered to be a PARASITIC ARRAY. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MULTIELEMENT ARRAYS frequently are classified according to their directivity. A 
BIDIRECTIONAL ARRAY radiates in opposite directions along the line of maximum radiation. A 
UNIDIRECTIONAL ARRAY radiates in only one general direction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Arrays can be described with respect to their radiation patterns and the types of elements of which 
they are made. However, you will find it useful to identify them by the physical placement of the 
elements and the direction of radiation with respect to these elements. Generally speaking, the term 
BROADSIDE ARRAY designates an array in which the direction of maximum radiation is perpendicular 
to the plane containing these elements. In actual practice, this term is confined to those arrays in which 
the elements themselves are also broadside, or parallel, with respect to each other. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A COLLINEAR ARRAY is one in which all the elements lie in a straight line with no radiation at 
the ends of the array. The direction of maximum radiation is perpendicular to the axis of the elements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An END-FIRE ARRAY is one in which the principal direction of radiation is along the plane of the 
array and perpendicular to the elements. Radiation is from the end of the array, which is the reason this 
arrangement is referred to as an end-fire array. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Sometimes a system uses the characteristics of more than one of the three types mentioned. For 
instance, some of the elements may be collinear while others may be parallel. Such an arrangement is </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

space. Reception at these points is either impaired or improved. If the different components arrive at a 
given point in the same phase, they add, making a stronger signal available. If they arrive out of phase, 
they cancel, reducing the signal strength. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Radiation Pattern 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Effects similar to those described in the preceding paragraph can be produced at the transmitting 
point itself. Consider the antennas shown in figure 4-21, views A and B. View A shows an unobstructed 
view of the radiation pattern of a single dipole. In view B two dipoles, shown as points 1 and 2, are 
perpendicular to the plane of the page. They are spaced 1/4 wavelength apart at the operating frequency. 
The radiation pattern from either antenna 1 or 2, operating alone, would be uniform in all directions in 
this plane, as shown in view A. Suppose that current is being fed to both antennas from the same 
transmitter in such a way that the current fed to antenna 2 lags the current in antenna 1 by 90 degrees. 
Energy radiating from antenna 1 toward receiving location X will reach antenna 2 after 1/4 cycle of 
operation. The energy from both antennas will add, and propagation toward X will be strong.

energy in antenna 1 was 1/4 cycle behind that of antenna 2 to begin with; therefore, the radiation from 
antenna 1 toward receiving point Y will be exactly 180 degrees out of phase with that of antenna 2. As a 
result, the radiation fields will cancel and there will be no radiation toward Y.

radiation pattern of the individual antennas. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Stub Phasing 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the case just discussed, the currents fed to the two antennas from the same transmitter were 90 
degrees out of phase. Sections of transmission line, called STUBS, are frequently used for this purpose. 
These stubs can be adjusted to produce any desired phase relationship between connected elements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When two collinear half-wave elements are connected directly so their currents are in the same 
phase, the effect is the same as that of a full-wave antenna, as shown in figure 4-22, view A. The current 
in the first 1/2 wavelength is exactly 180 degrees out of phase with that in the second 1/2 wavelength. 
This is the opposite of the desired condition. In the illustration, arrows are used to indicate the direction of 
current flow in the antenna. (Using arrows is a convenient means of determining the phase on more 
complicated arrays.) 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the two elements are connected by a shorted 1/4-wavelength stub, as shown in view B, current 
travels down one side of the stub and up the other. It travels a distance of a 1/2 wavelength in the stub 
itself. As a result, the current moves through 1/2 cycle of change. When the current reaches the second 
element, it is in the desired phase. Since the current on one side of the stub is equal and opposite to the 
current on the other side, the fields produced here cancel and no radiation is transmitted from the stub 
itself. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DIRECTIVITY-4-28-">DIRECTIVITY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The DIRECTIVITY of an antenna or an array can be determined by looking at its radiation pattern. 
In an array propagating a given amount of energy, more radiation takes place in certain directions than in 
others. The elements in the array can be altered in such a way that they change the pattern and distribute it 
more uniformly in all directions. The elements can be considered as a group of antennas fed from a 
common source and facing different directions. On the other hand, the elements could be arranged so that 
the radiation would be focused in a single direction. With no increase in power from the transmitter, the 
amount of radiation in a given direction would be greater. Since the input power has no increase, this 
increased directivity is achieved at the expense of gain in other directions. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Directivity and Interference 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In many applications, sharp directivity is desirable although no need exists for added gain. Examine 
the physical disposition of the units shown in figure 4-23. Transmitters 1 and 2 are sending information to 
receivers 1 and 2, respectively, along the paths shown by the solid arrows. The distance between 
transmitter 1 and receiver 1 or between transmitter 2 and receiver 2 is short and does not require high-
power transmission. The antennas of the transmitters propagate well in all directions. However, receiver 1 
picks up some of the signals from transmitter 2, and receiver 2 picks up some of the signals from 
transmitter 1, as shown by the broken arrows. This effect is emphasized if the receiving antennas intercept 
energy equally well in all directions. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The use of highly directional arrays as radiators from the transmitters tends to solve the problem. The 
signals are beamed along the paths of the solid arrows and provide very low radiation along the paths of 
the broken arrows. Further improvement along these lines is obtained by the use of narrowly directed 
arrays as receiving antennas. The effect of this arrangement is to select the desired signal while 
discriminating against all other signals. This same approach can be used to overcome other types of 
radiated interference. In such cases, preventing radiation in certain directions is more important than 
producing greater gain in other directions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at the differences between the field patterns of the single-element antenna and the array, as

single antenna. View B shows the horizontal-radiation pattern for an array. The antenna in view A </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

intensity in one lobe is considerably stronger than in the other. The lobe toward point X is called a 
MAJOR LOBE; the other is a MINOR LOBE. Since the complex radiation patterns associated with 
arrays frequently contain several lobes of varying intensity, you should learn to use appropriate 
terminology. In general, major lobes are those in which the greatest amount of radiation occurs. Minor 
lobes are those in which the radiation intensity is least.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Collinear Array

of the second radiator, however, tends to intensify the pattern. Compare the radiation pattern of the dipole

</p><p class="paragraph">PP1 axis. QQ1 represents the line of maximum propagation. You can see that radiation is stronger with an 
added element. The pattern in view B is sharper, or more directive, than that in view A. This means that 
the gain along the line of maximum energy propagation is increased and the beam width is decreased. As 
more elements are added, the effect is heightened, as shown in view C. Unimportant minor lobes are 
generated as more elements are added. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">More than four elements are seldom used because accumulated losses cause the elements farther 
from the point of feeding to have less current than the nearer ones. This introduces an unbalanced 
condition in the system and impairs its efficiency. Space limitations often are another reason for 
restricting the number of elements. Since this type of array is in a single line, rather than in a vertically 
stacked arrangement, the use of too many elements results in an antenna several wavelengths long. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RADIATION PATTERN.—The characteristic radiation pattern of a given array is obtained at the 
frequency or band of frequencies at which the system is resonant. The gain and directivity characteristics 
are lost when the antenna is not used at or near this frequency and the array tunes too sharply. A collinear 
antenna is more effective than an end-fire array when used off its tuned frequency. This feature is 
considered when transmission or reception is to be over a wide frequency band. When more than two 
elements are used, this advantage largely disappears. 
</p><p class="paragraph">LENGTH AND PHASING.—Although the 1/2 wavelength is the basis for the collinear element, 
you will find that greater lengths are often used. Effective arrays of this type have been constructed in 
which the elements are 0.7 and even 0.8 wavelength long. This type of array provides efficient operation 
at more than one frequency or over a wider frequency range. Whatever length is decided upon, all of the 
elements in a particular array should closely adhere to that length. If elements of different lengths are 
combined, current phasing and distribution are changed, throwing the system out of balance and seriously 
affecting the radiation pattern.

</p><p class="paragraph">an important factor to be considered when any two elements are parallel and are spaced so that 
considerable coupling is between them. There is very little mutual impedance between collinear sections. 
Where impedance does exist, it is caused by the coupling between the ends of adjacent elements. Placing 
the ends of elements close together is frequently necessary because of construction problems, especially 
where long lengths of wire are involved. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The effects of spacing and the advantages of proper spacing can be demonstrated by some practical 
examples. A collinear array consisting of two half-wave elements with 1/4-wavelength spacing between 
centers has a gain of 1.8 dB. If the ends of these same dipoles are separated so that the distance from 
center to center is 3/4 wavelengths and they are driven from the same source, the gain increases to 
approximately 2.9 dB. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A three-dipole array with negligible spacing between elements gives a gain of 3.3 dB. In other 
words, when two elements are used with wider spacing, the gain obtained is approximately equal to the 
gain obtainable from three elements with close spacing. The spacing of this array permits simpler 
construction, since only two dipoles are used. It also allows the antenna to occupy less space. 
Construction problems usually dictate small-array spacing. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Broadside Arrays 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A broadside array is shown in figure 4-26, view A. Physically, it looks somewhat like a ladder. 
When the array and the elements in it are polarized horizontally, it looks like an upright ladder. When the 
array is polarized vertically, it looks like a ladder lying on one side (view B). View C is an illustration of 
the radiation pattern of a broadside array. Horizontally polarized arrays using more than two elements are 
not common. This is because the requirement that the bottom of the array be a significant distance above 
the earth presents construction problems. Compared with collinear arrays, broadside arrays tune sharply, 
but lose efficiency rapidly when not operated on the frequencies for which they are designed. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">RADIATION PATTERN.—Figure 4-27 shows an end view of two parallel half-wave antennas (A 
and B) operating in the same phase and located 1/2 wavelength apart. At a point (P) far removed from the 
antennas, the antennas appear as a single point. Energy radiating toward P from antenna A starts out in 
phase with the energy radiating from antenna B in the same direction. Propagation from each antenna 
travels over the same distance to point P, arriving there in phase. The antennas reinforce each other in this 
direction, making a strong signal available at P. Field strength measured at P is greater than it would be if 
the total power supplied to both antennas had been fed to a single dipole. Radiation toward point P1 is 
built up in the same manner. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Next consider a wavefront traveling toward point Q from antenna B. By the time it reaches antenna 
A, 1/2 wavelength away, 1/2 cycle has elapsed. Therefore energy from antenna B meets the energy from 
antenna A 180 degrees out of phase. As a result, the energy moving toward point Q from the two sources 
cancels. In a like manner, radiation from antenna A traveling toward point Q1 meets and cancels the 
radiation in the same direction from antenna B. As a result, little propagation takes place in either 
direction along the QQ1 axis. Most of the energy is concentrated in both directions along the PP1 axis. 
When both antenna elements are fed from the same source, the result is the basic broadside array. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When more than two elements are used in a broadside arrangement, they are all parallel and in the 
same plane, as shown in figure 4-26, view B. Current phase, indicated by the arrows, must be the same for 
all elements. The radiation pattern shown in figure 4-26, view C, is always bi-directional. This pattern is 
sharper than the one shown in figure 4-27 because of the additional two elements. Directivity and gain 
depend on the number of elements and the spacing between them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">GAIN AND DIRECTIVITY.—The physical disposition of dipoles operated broadside to each other 
allows for much greater coupling between them than can occur between collinear elements. Moving the 
parallel antenna elements closer together or farther apart affects the actual impedance of the entire array 
and the overall radiation resistance as well. As the spacing between broadside elements increases, the 
effect on the radiation pattern is a sharpening of the major lobes. When the array consists of only two 
dipoles spaced exactly 1/2 wavelength apart, no minor lobes are generated at all. Increasing the distance 
between the elements beyond that point, however, tends to throw off the phase relationship between the 
original current in one element and the current induced in it by the other element. The result is that, 
although the major lobes are sharpened, minor lobes are introduced, even with two elements. These, 
however, are not large enough to be of concern. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you add the same number of elements to both a broadside array and a collinear array, the gain of 
the broadside array will be greater. Reduced radiation resistance resulting from the efficient coupling 
between dipoles accounts for most of this gain. However, certain practical factors limit the number of </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">End-Fire Arrays 
</h3><p class="paragraph">An end-fire array looks similar to a broadside array. The ladder-like appearance is characteristic of 
both (fig. 4-28, view A). The currents in the elements of the end-fire array, however, are usually 180 
degrees out of phase with each other as indicated by the arrows. The construction of the end-fire array is 
like that of a ladder lying on its side (elements horizontal). The dipoles in an end-fire array are closer 
together (1/8-wavelength to 1/4 -wavelength spacing) than they are for a broadside array. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Closer spacing between elements permits compactness of construction. For this reason an end-fire 
array is preferred to other arrays when high gain or sharp directivity is desired in a confined space. 
However, the close coupling creates certain disadvantages. Radiation resistance is extremely low, 
sometimes as low as 10 ohms, making antenna losses greater. The end-fire array is confined to a single 
frequency. With changes in climatic or atmospheric conditions, the danger of detuning exists. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RADIATION PATTERN.—The radiation pattern for a pair of parallel half-wave elements fed 180 
degrees out of phase is shown in figure 4-29, view A. The elements shown are spaced 1/2 wavelength 
apart. In practice, smaller spacings are used. Radiation from elements L and M traveling toward point P 
begins 180 degrees out of phase. Moving the same distance over approximately parallel paths, the 
respective wavefronts from these elements remain 180 degrees out of phase. In other words, maximum 
cancellation takes place in the direction of P. The same condition is true for the opposite direction (toward 
P1). The P to P1 axis is the line of least radiation for the end-fire array. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Consider what happens along the QQ1 axis. Energy radiating from element M toward Q reaches 
element L in about 1/2 cycle (180 degrees) after it leaves its source. Since element L was fed 180 degrees 
out of phase with element M, the wavefronts are now in the same phase and are both moving toward Q 
reinforcing each other. Similar reinforcement occurs along the same axis toward Q1. This simultaneous 
movement towards Q and Q1 develops a bi-directional pattern. This is not always true in end-fire 
operation. Another application of the end-fire principle is one in which the elements are spaced 1/4 
wavelength apart and phased 90 degrees from each other to produce a unidirectional pattern. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 4-29, view A, elements A and B are perpendicular to the plane represented by the page; 
therefore, only the ends of the antennas appear. In view B the antennas are rotated a quarter of a circle in 
space around the QQ1 axis so that they are seen in the plane of the elements themselves. Therefore, the 
PP1 axis, now perpendicular to the page, is not seen as a line. The RR1 axis, now seen as a line, is 
perpendicular to the PP1 axis as well as to the QQ1 axis. The end-fire array is directional in this plane 
also, although not quite as sharply. The reason for the greater broadness of the lobes can be seen by 
following the path of energy radiating from the midpoint of element B toward point S in view B. This 
energy passes the A element at one end after traveling slightly more than the perpendicular distance 
between the dipoles. Energy, therefore, does not combine in exact phase toward point S. Although 
maximum radiation cannot take place in this direction, energy from the two sources combines closely 
enough in phase to produce considerable reinforcement. A similar situation exists for wavefronts traveling 
toward T. However, the wider angle from Q to T produces a greater phase difference and results in a 
decrease in the strength of the combined wave. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Directivity occurs from either one or both ends of the end-fire array, along the axis of the array, as

However, if a reflector were placed behind the bulb, the space in front of the reflector would be brighter

</p><p class="paragraph">that at a particular point the field strength is 10 times more than it would be at the same distance from a 
half-wave antenna. The antenna system is then said to have a gain of 10. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Parasitic arrays represent another method of achieving high antenna gains. A parasitic array consists 
of one or more parasitic elements placed in parallel with each other and, in most cases, at the same 
line-of-sight level. The parasitic element is fed inductively by radiated energy coming from the driven 
element connected to the transmitter. It is in NO way connected directly to the driven element. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the parasitic element is placed so that it radiates away from the driven element, the element is 
a director. When the parasitic element is placed so that it radiates toward the driven element, the parasitic 
element is a reflector. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The directivity pattern resulting from the action of parasitic elements depends on two factors. These 
are (1) the tuning, determined by the length of the parasitic element; and (2) the spacing between the 
parasitic and driven elements. To a lesser degree, it also depends on the diameter of the parasitic element, 
since diameter has an effect on tuning. 
</p><p class="paragraph">OPERATION.—When a parasitic element is placed a fraction of a wavelength away from the 
driven element and is of approximately resonant length, it will re-radiate the energy it intercepts. The 
parasitic element is effectively a tuned circuit coupled to the driven element, much as the two windings of 
a transformer are coupled together. The radiated energy from the driven element causes a voltage to be 
developed in the parasitic element, which, in turn, sets up a magnetic field. This magnetic field extends 
over to the driven element, which then has a voltage induced in it. The magnitude and phase of the 
induced voltage depend on the length of the parasitic element and the spacing between the elements. In 
actual practice the length and spacing are arranged so that the phase and magnitude of the induced voltage 
cause a unidirectional, horizontal-radiation pattern and an increase in gain. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the parasitic array in figure 4-31, view A, the parasitic and driven elements are spaced 1/4 
wavelength apart. The radiated signal coming from the driven element strikes the parasitic element after 
1/4 cycle. The voltage developed in the parasitic element is 180 degrees out of phase with that of the 
driven element. This is because of the distance traveled (90 degrees) and because the induced current lags 
the inducing flux by 90 degrees (90 + 90 = 180 degrees). The magnetic field set up by the parasitic 
element induces a voltage in the driven element 1/4 cycle later because the spacing between the elements 
is 1/4 wavelength. This induced voltage is in phase with that in the driven element and causes an increase 
in radiation in the direction indicated in figure 4-31, view A. Since the direction of the radiated energy is 
stronger in the direction away from the parasitic element (toward the driven element), the parasitic 
element is called a reflector. The radiation pattern as it would appear if you were looking down on the 
antenna is shown in view B. The pattern as it would look if viewed from the ends of the elements is 
shown in view C. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Changing the spacing and length can change the radiation pattern so that maximum radiation is on 
the same side of the driven element as the parasitic element. In this instance the parasitic element is called 
a director. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Combining a reflector and a director with the driven element causes a decrease in back radiation and 
an increase in directivity. This combination results in the two main advantages of a parasitic array—
unidirectivity and increased gain. If the parasitic array is rotated, it can pick up or transmit in different 
directions because of the reduction of transmitted energy in all but the desired direction. An antenna of 
this type is called a ROTARY ARRAY. Size for size, both the gain and directivity of parasitic arrays are 
greater than those of driven arrays. The disadvantage of parasitic arrays is that their adjustment is critical 
and they do not operate over a wide frequency range. 
</p><p class="paragraph">GAIN AND DIRECTIVITY.—Changing the spacing between either the director or the reflector 
and the driven element results in a change in the radiation pattern. More gain and directivity are obtained 
by changing the length of the parasitic elements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The FRONT-TO-BACK RATIO of an array is the proportion of energy radiated in the principal 
direction of radiation to the energy radiated in the opposite direction. A high front-to-back ratio is 
desirable because this means that a minimum amount of energy is radiated in the undesired direction. 
Since completely suppressing all such radiation is impossible, an infinite ratio cannot be achieved. In 
actual practice, however, rather high values can be attained. Usually the length and spacing of the 
parasitic elements are adjusted so that a maximum front-to-back ratio is obtained, rather than maximum 
gain in the desired direction.

driven element. If the array contains two parasitic elements (a reflector and a director) in addition to the 
driven element, it is usually known as a THREE-ELEMENT ARRAY. If three parasitic elements are 
used, the array is known as a FOUR-ELEMENT ARRAY, and so on. Generally speaking, if more 
parasitic elements are added to a three-element array, each added element is a director. The field behind a 
reflector is so small that additional reflectors would have little effect on the overall radiation pattern. In 
radar, from one to five directors are used.

(figure 4-32, views A and B). The spacings between the elements are not uniform. The radiation from the 
different elements arrives in phase in the forward direction, but out of phase by various amounts in the 
other directions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The director and the reflector in the Yagi antenna are usually welded to a conducting rod or tube at 
their centers. This support does not interfere with the operation of the antenna. Since the driven element is 
center-fed, it is not welded to the supporting rod. The center impedance can be increased by using a 
folded dipole as the driven element. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Yagi antenna shown in figure 4-32, view A, has three directors. In general, the greater number 
of parasitic elements used, the greater the gain. However, a greater number of such elements causes the 
array to have a narrower frequency response as well as a narrower beamwidth. Therefore, proper 
adjustment of the antenna is critical. The gain does not increase directly with the number of elements 
used. For example, a three-element Yagi array has a relative power gain of 5 dB. Adding another director 
results in a 2 dB increase. Additional directors have less and less effect. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A typical Yagi array used for receiving and transmitting energy is shown with a support frame in 
figure 4-33. This antenna is used by the military services. It operates at frequencies of from 12 to 50 
megahertz and consists of two separate arrays (one high-frequency and one low-frequency antenna array) 
mounted on one frame. The various elements are indicated in the figure. The high-frequency (hf) array 
consists of one reflector, one driven element, and two directors; the low-frequency (lf) array has the same 
arrangement with one less director. The lengths of the elements in the high-frequency array are shorter 
than those in the low-frequency array. The physical lengths of the elements in the individual arrays are 
equal, but the electrical lengths can be varied by means of the tuning stubs at the center of the elements. 
The array can be rotated in any desired direction by a remotely controlled, electrically driven, antenna 
rotator. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

antennas we touch on briefly since they are covered thoroughly in other courses. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Previously discussed antennas operate with standing waves of current and voltage along the wires. 
This section deals principally with antenna systems in which the current is practically uniform in all parts 
of the antenna. In its basic form, such an antenna consists of a single wire grounded at the far end through 
a resistor. The resistor has a value equal to the characteristic impedance of the antenna. This termination, 
just as in the case of an ordinary transmission line, eliminates standing waves. The current, therefore, 
decreases uniformly along the wire as the terminated end is approached. This decrease is caused by the 
loss of energy through radiation. The energy remaining at the end of the antenna is dissipated in the 
terminating resistor. For such an antenna to be a good radiator, its length must be fairly long. Also, the 
wire must not be too close to the ground. The return path through the ground will cause cancellation of 
the radiation. If the wire is sufficiently long, it will be practically nonresonant over a wide range of 
operating frequencies. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

In general, the gain achieved with long-wire antennas is not as great as the gain obtained from the 
multielement arrays studied in the previous section. But the long-wire antenna has advantages of its own. 
The construction of long-wire antennas is simple, both electrically and mechanically, with no particularly 
critical dimensions or adjustments. The long-wire antenna will work well and give satisfactory gain and 
directivity over a frequency range up to twice the value for which it was cut. In addition, it will accept 
power and radiate it efficiently on any frequency for which its overall length is not less than 
approximately 1/2 wavelength. Another factor is that long-wire antennas have directional patterns that are 
sharp in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Also, they tend to concentrate the radiation at the low 
vertical angles. Another type of long-wire antenna is the BEVERAGE ANTENNA, also called a WAVE 
ANTENNA. It is a horizontal, long-wire antenna designed especially for the reception and transmission 
of low-frequency, vertically polarized ground waves. It consists of a single wire, two or more 
wavelengths long, supported 3 to 6 meters above the ground, and terminated in its characteristic 
impedance, as shown in figure 4-34.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A V ANTENNA is a bi-directional antenna used widely in military and commercial 
communications. It consists of two conductors arranged to form a V. Each conductor is fed with currents 
of opposite polarity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The V is formed at such an angle that the main lobes reinforce along the line bisecting the V and 
make a very effective directional antenna (see figure 4-35). Connecting the two-wire feed line to the apex 
of the V and exciting the two sides of the V 180 degrees out of phase cause the lobes to add along the line 
of the bisector and to cancel in other directions, as shown in figure 4-36. The lobes are designated 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 on leg AA', and 5, 6, 7, and 8 on leg BB'. When the proper angle between AA' and BB' is chosen, 
lobes 1 and 4 have the same direction and combine with lobes 7 and 6, respectively. This combination of 
two major lobes from each leg results in the formation of two stronger lobes, which lie along an 
imaginary line bisecting the enclosed angle. Lobes 2, 3, 5, and 8 tend to cancel each other, as do the 
smaller lobes, which are approximately at right angles to the wire legs of the V. The resultant waveform 
pattern is shown at the right of the V antenna in figure 4-36. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">The rhombic antenna is useful over a wide frequency range. Although some changes in gain, 
directivity, and characteristic impedance do occur with a change in operating frequency, these changes are 
small enough to be neglected. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The rhombic antenna is much easier to construct and maintain than other antennas of comparable

the antenna. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The rhombic antenna also has the advantage of being noncritical as far as operation and adjustment 
are concerned. This is because of the broad frequency characteristics of the antenna. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Still another advantage is that the voltages present on the antenna are much lower than those 
produced by the same input power on a resonant antenna. This is particularly important when high 
transmitter powers are used or when high-altitude operation is required. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Disadvantages 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The rhombic antenna is not without its disadvantages. The principal one is that a fairly large antenna 
site is required for its erection. Each leg is made at least 1 or 2 wavelengths long at the lowest operating 
frequency. When increased gain and directivity are required, legs of from 8 to 12 wavelengths are used. 
These requirements mean that high-frequency rhombic antennas have wires of several hundred feet in 
length. Therefore, they are used only when a large plot of land is available. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another disadvantage is that the horizontal and vertical patterns depend on each other. If a rhombic 
antenna is made to have a narrow horizontal beam, the beam is also lower in the vertical direction. 
Therefore, obtaining high vertical-angle radiation is impossible except with a very broad horizontal 
pattern and low gain. Rhombic antennas are used, however, for long-distance sky wave coverage at the 
high frequencies. Under these conditions low vertical angles of radiation (less than 20 degrees) are 
desirable. With the rhombic antenna, a considerable amount of the input power is dissipated uselessly in 
the terminating resistor. However, this resistor is necessary to make the antenna unidirectional. The great 
gain of the antenna more than makes up for this loss. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Radiation Patterns 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-38 shows the individual radiation patterns produced by the four legs of the rhombic antenna 
and the resultant radiation pattern. The principle of operation is the same as for the V and the 
half-rhombic antennas. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Terminating Resistor 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The terminating resistor plays an important part in the operation of the rhombic antenna. Upon it 
depend the unidirectivity of the antenna and the lack of resonance effects. An antenna should be properly 
terminated so it will have a constant impedance at its input. Terminating the antenna properly will also 
allow it to be operated over a wide frequency range without the necessity for changing the coupling 
adjustments at the transmitter. Discrimination against signals coming from the rear is of great importance </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

with equal currents 90 degrees out of phase, the typical figure-eight patterns of the two antennas merge to 
produce the nearly circular pattern shown in figure 4-39, view A. Pairs of such antennas are frequently 
stacked, as shown in figure 4-40. Each pair is called a BAY. In figure 4-40 two bays are used and are 
spaced 1/2 wavelength apart, and the corresponding elements are excited in phase. These conditions cause 
a part of the vertical radiation from each bay to cancel that of the other bay. This results in a decrease in 
energy radiated at high vertical angles and increases the energy radiated in the horizontal plane. Stacking 
a number of bays can alter the vertical radiation pattern, causing a substantial gain in a horizontal 
direction without altering the overall horizontal directivity pattern. Figure 4-39, view B, compares the 
circular vertical radiation pattern of a single-bay turnstile with the sharp pattern of a four-bay turnstile 
array. A three-dimensional radiation pattern of a four-bay turnstile antenna is shown in figure 4-39, view

</h2><p class="paragraph">A vertical quarter-wave antenna several wavelengths above ground produces a high angle of 
radiation that is very undesirable at vhf and uhf frequencies. The most common means of producing a low 
angle of radiation from such an antenna is to work the radiator against a simulated ground called a 
GROUND PLANE. A simulated ground may be made from a large metal sheet or several wires or rods 
radiating from the base of the radiator. An antenna so constructed is known as a GROUND-PLANE 
ANTENNA. Two ground-plane antennas are shown in figure 4-41, views A and B. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CORNER-REFLECTOR-4-46-">CORNER REFLECTOR 
</h2><p class="paragraph">When a unidirectional radiation pattern is desired, it can be obtained by the use of a corner reflector 
with a half-wave dipole. A CORNER-REFLECTOR ANTENNA is a half-wave radiator with a reflector. 
The reflector consists of two flat metal surfaces meeting at an angle immediately behind the radiator. In 
other words, the radiator is set in the plane of a line bisecting the corner angle formed by the reflector </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

mounted with the radiator and the reflector in the horizontal position when horizontal polarization is 
desired. In such cases the radiation pattern is very narrow in the vertical plane, with maximum signal 
being radiated in line with the bisector of the corner angle. The directivity in the horizontal plane is 
approximately the same as for any half-wave radiator having a single-rod type reflector behind it. If the 
antenna is mounted with the radiator and the corner reflector in the vertical position, as shown in view A, 
maximum radiation is produced in a very narrow horizontal beam. Radiation in a vertical plane will be the 
same as for a similar radiator with a single-rod type reflector behind it.

</p><p class="question">Q48. What is the primary reason for the development of the turnstile antenna? 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RF-SAFETY-PRECAUTIONS-4-47-">RF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Although electromagnetic radiation from transmission lines and antennas is usually of insufficient 
strength to electrocute personnel, it can lead to other accidents and compound injuries. Voltages may be 
induced in ungrounded metal objects, such as wire guys, wire cable (hawser), hand rails, or ladders. If you 
come in contact with these objects, you could receive a shock or rf burn. This shock can cause you to 
jump or fall into nearby mechanical equipment or, when working aloft, to fall from an elevated work area. 
Take care to ensure that all transmission lines or antennas are deenergized before working near or on 
them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Either check or have someone check all guys, cables, rails, and ladders around your work area for rf 
shock dangers. Use working aloft "chits" and safety harnesses for your own safety. Signing a "working 
aloft chit" signifies that all equipment is in a nonradiating status. The person who signs the chit should 
ensure that no rf danger exists in areas where you or other personnel will be working. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Nearby ships or parked aircraft are another source of rf energy that you must consider when you 
check a work area for safety. Combustible materials can be ignited and cause severe fires from arcs or 
heat generated by rf energy. Also, rf radiation can detonate ordnance devices by inducing currents in the 
internal wiring of the devices or in the external test equipment or leads connected to them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">ALWAYS obey rf radiation warning signs and keep a safe distance from radiating antennas. The six 
types of warning signs for rf radiation hazards are shown in figure 4-43. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Close or direct contact with rf transmission lines or antennas may result in rf burns. These are 
usually deep, penetrating, third-degree burns. To heal properly, these burns must heal from the inside to 
the skin's surface. To prevent infection, you must give proper attention to all rf burns, including the small 
"pinhole" burns. Petrolatum gauze can be used to cover these burns temporarily, before the injured person 
reports to medical facilities for further treatment. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DIELECTRIC-HEATING-4-49-">DIELECTRIC HEATING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">DIELECTRIC HEATING is the heating of an insulating material by placing it in a high-frequency 
electric field. The heat results from internal losses during the rapid reversal of polarization of molecules 
in the dielectric material. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the case of a human in an rf field, the body acts as a dielectric. If the power in the rf field exceeds 
10 milliwatts per centimeter, a person in that field will have a noticeable rise in body temperature. The 
eyes are highly susceptible to dielectric heating. For this reason, you should not look directly into devices 
radiating rf energy. The vital organs of the body also are susceptible to dielectric heating. For your own 
safety, you must NOT stand directly in the path of rf radiating devices. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PRECAUTIONS-WHEN-WORKING-ALOFT-4-49-">PRECAUTIONS WHEN WORKING ALOFT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">When radio or radar antennas are energized by transmitters, you must not go aloft unless advance 
tests show that little or no danger exists. A casualty can occur from even a small spark drawn from a 
charged piece of metal or rigging. Although the spark itself may be harmless, the "surprise" may cause 
you to let go of the antenna involuntarily and you may fall. There is also a shock hazard if nearby 
antennas are energized. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Rotating antennas also might cause you to fall when you are working aloft. Motor safety switches 
controlling the motion of rotating antennas must be tagged and locked open before you go aloft near such 
antennas. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When working near a stack, you should draw and wear the recommended oxygen breathing 
apparatus. Among other toxic substances, stack gas contains carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is too 
unstable to build up to a high concentration in the open, but prolonged exposure to even small quantities 
is dangerous.
