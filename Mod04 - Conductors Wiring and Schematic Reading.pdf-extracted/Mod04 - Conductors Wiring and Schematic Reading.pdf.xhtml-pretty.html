SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current

</p><p class="paragraph">sides of which are each 1 mil. To obtain the cross-sectional area of a square conductor, multiply the 
</p><p class="paragraph">dimension of any side of the square by itself. For example, assume that you have a square conductor with 
</p><p class="paragraph">a side dimension of 3 mils. Multiply 3 mils by itself (3 mils × 3 mils). This gives you a cross-sectional 
area of 9 square mils.

equals 18 square mils. Here is another example. Assume that a conductor is 3/8 inch thick and 4 inches 
</p><p class="paragraph">wide. The 3/8 inch can be expressed in decimal form as 0.375 inch. Since 1 mil equals 0.001 inch, the

1,000 mils per inch, the width will be 4 × 1,000, or 4,000 mils. To determine the cross-sectional area,

</h2><h3 class="subsection">The circular mil is the standard unit of measurement of a round wire cross-sectional area (view C of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">figure 1-1). This unit of measurement is found in American and English wire tables. The diameter of a 
</p><p class="paragraph">round conductor (wire) used to conduct electricity may be only a fraction of an inch. Therefore, it is 
</p><p class="paragraph">convenient to express this diameter in mils to avoid using decimals. For example, the diameter of a wire is 
</p><p class="paragraph">expressed as 25 mils instead of 0.025 inch. A circular mil is the area of a circle having a diameter of 1 
</p><p class="paragraph">mil, as shown in view B of figure 1-2. The area in circular mils of a round conductor is obtained by 
</p><p class="paragraph">squaring the diameter, measured in mils. Thus, a wire having a diameter of 25 mils has an area of 252, or 
</p><p class="paragraph">625 circular mils. To determine the number of square mils in the same conductor, apply the conventional 
</p><p class="paragraph">formula for determining the area of a circle (A = pir2). In this formula, A (area) is the unknown and is 
equal to the cross-sectional area in square mils, pi is the constant 3.14, and r is the radius of the circle, or 
half the diameter (D). Through substitution, A = 3.14, and (12.5) 2; therefore, 3.14 × 156.25 = 490.625 </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">danger of fires caused by the improper selection of wire sizes. Wires can carry only a limited amount of 
</p><p class="paragraph">current safely. If the current flowing through a wire exceeds the current-carrying capacity of the wire, 
</p><p class="paragraph">excess heat is generated. This heat may be great enough to burn off the insulation around the wire and 
</p><p class="paragraph">start a fire. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FACTORS-GOVERNING-THE-CURRENT-RATING-1-11-">FACTORS GOVERNING THE CURRENT RATING 
</h2><h3 class="subsection">The current rating of a cable or wire indicates the current capacity that the wire or cable can safely 
</h3><p class="paragraph">carry continuously. If this limit, or current rating, is exceeded for a length of time, the heat generated may 
</p><p class="paragraph">burn the insulation. The current rating of a wire is used to determine what size is needed for a given load, 
</p><p class="paragraph">or current drain. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The factors that determine the current rating of a wire are the conductor size, the location of the wire 
</h3><p class="paragraph">in a circuit, the type of insulation, and the safe current rating. Another factor that will be discussed later in 
</p><p class="paragraph">this chapter is the material the wire is made of. As you have already seen, these factors also affect the

</h2><h3 class="subsection">An increase in the diameter, or cross section, of a wire conductor decreases its resistance and

</h2><p class="paragraph">The location of a wire in a circuit determines the temperature under which it operates. A wire may be 
</p><p class="paragraph">located in a conduit or laced with other wires in a cable. Because it is confined, the wire operates at a 
</p><p class="paragraph">higher temperature than if it were open to the free air. The higher the temperature under which a wire is 
</p><p class="paragraph">operating, the greater will be its resistance. Its capacity to carry current is also lowered. Note that, in each 
</p><p class="paragraph">case, the resistance of a wire determines its current-carrying capacity. The greater the resistance, the more 
</p><p class="paragraph">power it dissipates in the form of heat energy. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Conductors may also be installed in locations where the ambient (surrounding) temperature is

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-16 is an example of a lead-sheathed (jacketed) cable used in power work. This cable is a 
</p><p class="paragraph">standard three-conductor type. Each conductor is insulated and then wrapped in a layer of rubberized 
</p><p class="paragraph">tape. The conductors are twisted together, and rope or fillers are added to form a round core. Over this is 
</p><p class="paragraph">wrapped a second layer of tape called a serving. Finally, a lead sheath is molded around the cable. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
Figure 1-16.—Lead-sheathed cable. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Lead-sheathed cable is one of three types currently being used: alloy lead, pure lead, and reinforced 
</h3><p class="paragraph">lead. An alloy-lead sheath is much like a pure lead sheath but is manufactured with 2-percent tin. This 
</p><p class="paragraph">alloy is more resistant to gouging and abrasion during and after installation. Reinforced lead sheath is 
</p><p class="paragraph">used mainly for oil-filled cables where high internal pressures can be expected. Reinforced lead sheath 
</p><p class="paragraph">consists of a double lead sheath. A thin tape of hard-drawn copper, bronze, or other elastic metal 
</p><p class="paragraph">(preferably nonmagnetic) is wrapped around the inner sheath. This tape gives considerable additional 
</p><p class="paragraph">strength and elasticity to the sheath, but must be protected from corrosion. For this reason, a second lead 
</p><p class="paragraph">sheath is applied over the tape. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Metallic Armor 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Metallic armor provides a tough protective covering for wires and cables. The type, thickness, and 
</p><h3 class="subsection">kind of metal used to make the armor depend on three factors: (1) the use of the conductors, (2) the

</p><p class="paragraph">specific application. In order for you to compare the different types and sizes of conductors, we discussed 
</p><p class="paragraph">the following factors: 
</p><p class="paragraph">Unit SizeThe unit size of a conductor is the mil-foot. A mil-foot is a circular conductor 1foot long 
with a diameter of 1 mil (0.001 inch, or one-thousandth of an inch). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection"> 
Conductor SizesThe square mil and the circular mil are the units of measure used to determine 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the cross-sectional area of electrical conductors. The square mil, as it relates to a square conductor, is the 
</p><p class="paragraph">cross-sectional area of a square conductor that has a side of 1 mil. The circular mil is the cross-sectional 
</p><p class="paragraph">area of a circular conductor having a diameter of 1 mil. The circular mil area (CMA) of a conductor is 
</p><p class="paragraph">computed by squaring the diameter of the circular conductor is mils. Thus, a wire having a diameter of 4 
</p><p class="paragraph">mils (0.004 inch) has a CMA of 42, or 16 circular mils. If the conductor is stranded, the CMA for a strand 
</p><h3 class="subsection">is computed, and the CMA for the conductor is computed by multiplying the CMA of the strand by the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">number of strands. The relationship of the square mil to the circular mil is determined by comparing the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">square mil area of a circular conductor having a diameter of 1 mil (A = pir2) to the circular mil area of the 
same conductor (D
</h3><p class="paragraph">2
). Therefore, there is 0.7854 square mil to 1 circular mil. There are more circular mils 
</p><p class="paragraph">than square mils in a given area. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Specific ResistanceThe specific resistance of a substance is the resistance in ohms offered by a 
unit volume (the circular-mil-foot) to the flow of electric current. The three factors that are used to 
</p><h3 class="subsection">calculate the specific resistance of a particular conductor are (1) its length, (2) its cross-sectional area, and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">(3) the specific resistance of a unit volume of the substance from which the conductor is made. The 
</p><h3 class="subsection">specific resistance for various sizes and lengths of standard solid copper wire can be determined by the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">use of tables. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Wire GaugeA wire gauge is used to determine the American Standard Wire Gauge size of 
conductors. The measurement of a bare conductor is taken in the slot, not in the circular area at the 
</p><p class="paragraph">bottom of the slot. 
</p><h3 class="subsection"> 
Selection of Wire SizeFour factors must be considered in selecting the proper wire size for a 
</h3><p class="paragraph">particular electrical circuit. These factors are (1) conductor size, (2) the material it's made of, (3) the

</p><p class="paragraph">in a high-temperature environment are FEP, extruded polytetrafluoroethylene, and silicone rubber. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">ambient (surrounding) temperature of a conductor is an important part of total conductor heating. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Copper-versus-Aluminum ConductorsThe two most common metals used for electrical 
conductors are copper and aluminum. Some advantages of copper over aluminum as a conductor are that 
</p><p class="paragraph">copper has higher conductivity, is more ductile, has a higher tensile strength, and can be easily soldered. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Two advantages of aluminum wire for carrying electricity over long distances are its lightness and it 
</h3><p class="paragraph">reduces corona (the discharge of electricity from a wire at high potential). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Temperature Coefficient of ResistanceThe temperature coefficient of resistance is the amount of 
increase in the resistance of a 1-ohm sample of a conductor per degree of temperature rise above 0º C. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The resistance of copper and other pure metals increases with an increase in temperature. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Conductor InsulationInsulators have a resistance that is so great that, for all practical purposes, 
they are nonconductors. Two fundamental properties of insulating materials are (1) insulation resistance 
</p><p class="paragraph">and (2) the resistance to current leakage through the insulation. Dielectric strength is the ability of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">insulation material to withstand potential difference. The dielectric strength of an insulator is determined 
</p><p class="paragraph">by raising the voltage on a test sample until it breaks down. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Insulating MaterialsSome common insulating materials have properties and safety precautions 
that should be remembered. These are: 
</p><h3 class="subsection">• The purpose of coating a copper conductor with tin when rubber insulation is used is to prevent 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the insulation from deteriorating due to chemical action. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">• When extruded polytetrafluoroethylene insulation is heated, caution should be observed not to 
</h3><p class="paragraph">breathe the vapors. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">• The most commonly used insulating materials for extremely high-voltage conductors are 
</h3><p class="paragraph">varnished cambric and oil-impregnated paper. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Magnet wire is the common name for enamel-insulated wire used in meters, relays, small 
</h3><p class="paragraph">transformers, motor windings, and so forth. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">• The Navy is getting away from using asbestos insulation because asbestos fibers can cause lung 
</h3><p class="paragraph">disease and/or cancer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Asbestos insulation becomes a conductor when it gets wet. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
Conductor ProtectionThere are several types of conductor protection in use. The type commonly 
</p><p class="paragraph">used aboard Navy ships is wire-braid armor. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Conductor splices and connections are an essential part of any electrical circuit. When conductors 
join each other or connect to a load, splices or terminals must be used. Therefore, it is important that they 
be properly made. Any electrical circuit is only as good as its weakest link. The basic requirement of any 
splice or connection is that it be both mechanically and electrically as sound as the conductor or device 
with which it is used. Quality workmanship and materials must be used to ensure lasting electrical 
contact, physical strength, and insulation. The most common methods of making splices and connections 
in electrical cables is explained in the discussion that follows. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INSULATION-REMOVAL-2-2-">INSULATION REMOVAL 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The preferred method of removing insulation is with a wire-stripping tool, if available. A sharp knife 
may also be used. Other typical wire strippers in use in the Navy are illustrated in figure 2-1. The hot-
blade, rotary, and bench wire strippers (views A, B, and C, respectively) are usually found in shops where 
large wire bundles are made. When using any of these automatic wire strippers, follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for adjusting the machine; this avoids nicking, cutting, or otherwise damaging the conductors. 
The hand wire strippers are common hand tools found throughout the Navy. The hand wire strippers 
(view D of figure 2-1) are the ones you will most likely be using. Wire strippers vary in size according to 
wire size and can be ordered for any size needed.

</h3><p class="paragraph">The procedure for stripping wire with the hand wire stripper is as follows (refer to figure 2-2): 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Insert the wire into the center of the correct cutting slot for the wire size to be stripped. The wire 
sizes are listed on the cutting jaws of the hand wire strippers beneath each slot. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. After inserting the wire into the proper slot, close the handles together as far as they will go. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Slowly release the pressure on the handles so as not to allow the cutting blades to make contact 
with the stripped conductor. On some of the newer style hand wire strippers, the cutting jaws 
have a safety lock that helps prevent this from happening. Continue to release pressure until the 
gripper jaws release the stripped wire, then remove. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Knife Stripping 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A sharp knife may be used to strip the insulation from a conductor. The procedure is much the same 
as for sharpening a pencil. The knife should be held at approximately a 60º  angle to the conductor. Use 
extreme care when cutting through the insulation to avoid nicking or cutting the conductor. This 
procedure produces a taper on the cut insulation as shown in figure 2-3. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

These insulators are highly heat resistant. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. When using the hot-blade stripper, make sure the blades are clean. Clean the blades with a brass 
wire brush as necessary. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Make sure all stripping blades are sharp and free from nicks, dents, and so forth. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. When using any type of wire stripper, hold the wire perpendicular to the cutting blades. 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. Make sure the insulation is clean-cut with no frayed or ragged edges; trim if necessary. 
</p><p class="paragraph">6. Make sure all insulation is removed from the stripped area. Some types of wire are supplied with 
a transparent layer between the conductor and the primary insulation. If this is present, remove it. 
</p><p class="paragraph">7. When the hand strippers are used to remove lengths of insulation longer than 3/4 inch, the 
stripping procedure must be done in two or more operations. The strippers will only strip about 
3/4 inch at one time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">8. Retwist strands by hand, if necessary, to restore the natural lay and tightness of the strands. 
</p><p class="paragraph">9. Strip aluminum wires with a knife as described earlier. Aluminum wire should be stripped very 
carefully. Care should be taken not to nick the aluminum wire as the strands break very easily

</p><p class="paragraph">1. Prepare the wires for splicing. Enough insulation is removed to make the splice. The conductor 
is cleaned. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Bring the wires to a crossed position and make a long twist or bend in each wire. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Wrap one end of the wire and then the other end four or five times around the straight portion of 
each wire. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Press the ends of the wires down as close as possible to the straight portion of the wire. This 
prevents the sharp ends from puncturing the tape covering that is wrapped over the splice. The 
various types of tape and their uses are discussed later in this chapter. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Staggering Splices 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Joining small multiconductor cables often presents a problem. Each conductor must be spliced and 
taped. If the splices are directly opposite each other, the overall size of the joint becomes large and bulky. 
A smoother and less bulky joint can be made by staggering the splices. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-6  shows how a two-conductor cable is joined to a similar size cable by using a Western 
Union splice and by staggering the splices. Care should be taken to ensure that a short wire from one side 
of the cable is spliced to a long wire, from the other side of the cable. The sharp ends are then clamped 
firmly down on the conductor. The figure shows a Western Union splice, but other types of splices work 
just as well.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Rattail Joint 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A splice that is used in a junction box and for connecting branch circuits is the rattail joint (figure 2-
7). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Wiring that is installed in buildings is usually placed inside long lengths of steel or aluminum pipe 
called a conduit. Whenever branch or multiple circuits are needed, junction boxes are used to join the 
conduit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To create a rattail joint, first strip the insulation off the ends of the conductors to be joined. You then 
twist the wires to form the rattail effect. This type of splice will not stand much stress. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Fixture Joint 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The fixture joint is used to connect a small-diameter wire, such as in a lighting fixture, to a larger 
diameter wire used in a branch circuit. Like the rattail joint, the fixture joint will not stand much strain. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-8 shows the steps in making a fixture joint. The first step is to remove the insulation and 
clean the wires to be joined. After the wires are prepared, the fixture wire is wrapped a few times around 
the branch wire. The end of the branch wire is then bent over the completed turns. The remainder of the 
bare fixture wire is then wrapped over the bent branch wire. Soldering and taping completes the job.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Knotted Tap Joint 
</h3><p class="paragraph">All the splices discussed up to this point are known as butted splices. Each was made by joining the 
free ends of the conductors together. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to join a branch conductor to a 
continuous wire called the main wire. Such a junction is called a tap joint. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The main wire, to which the branch wire is to be tapped, has about 1 inch of insulation removed. The 
branch wire is stripped of about 3 inches of insulation. The knotted tap is shown in figure 2-9. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The branch wire is laid behind the main wire. About three-fourths of the bare portion of the branch 
wire extends above the main wire. The branch wire is brought under the main wire, around itself, and then 
over the main wire to form a knot. The branch wire is then wrapped around the main conductor in short, 
tight turns; and the end is trimmed off. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The knotted tap is used where the splice is subject to strain or slippage. When there is no strain, the 
knot may be eliminated. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Wire Nut and Split Bolt Splices 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The wire nut (view A of figure 2-10) is a device commonly used to replace the rattail joint splice. 
The wire nut is housed in plastic insulating material. To use the wire nut, place the two stripped 
conductors into the wire nut and twist the nut. In so doing, this will form a splice like the rattail joint and 
insulate itself by drawing the wire insulation into the wire nut insulation. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The splices we have discussed so far are usually insulated with tape. The following discussion will 
cover some characteristics of rubber, friction, and plastic insulation tapes. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Rubber Tape 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Latex (rubber) tape is a splicing compound. It is used where the original insulation was rubber. The 
tape is applied to the splice with a light tension so that each layer presses tightly against the one beneath 
it. This pressure causes the rubber tape to blend into a solid mass. Upon completion, insulation similar to 
the original is restored. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In roll form, there is a layer of paper or treated cloth between each layer of rubber tape. This layer 
prevents the latex from fusing while still on the roll. The paper or cloth is peeled off and discarded before 
the tape is applied to the splice. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The rubber splicing tape should be applied smoothly and under tension so no air space exists 
between the layers. Start the first layer near the middle of the joint instead of the end. The diameter of the 
completed insulated joint should be somewhat greater than the overall diameter of the original wire, 
including the insulation. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WARNING-2-10-">WARNING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Some rubber tapes are made for special applications. These types are 
semiconducting and will pass electrical current, which presents a shock hazard. 
These types of tape are packaged similar to the latex rubber tape. Care should be 
taken to insulate splices only with latex rubber insulating tape. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Friction Tape 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Putting rubber tape over the splice means that the insulation has been restored to a great degree. It is 
also necessary to restore the protective covering. Friction tape is used for this purpose. It also provides a 
minor degree of electrical insulation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Friction tape is a cotton cloth that has been treated with a sticky rubber compound. It comes in rolls 
similar to rubber tape except that no paper or cloth separator is used. Friction tape is applied like rubber 
tape; however, it does not stretch. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The friction tape should be started slightly back on the original insulation. Wind the tape so that each 
turn overlaps the one before it. Extend the tape over onto the insulation at the other end of the splice. 
From this point, a second layer is wound back along the splice until the original starting point is reached. 
Cutting the tape and firmly pressing down the ends completes the job. When proper care is taken, the 
splice and insulation can take as much abuse as the rest of the original wire. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Plastic Electrical Tape 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Plastic electrical tape has come into wide use in recent years. It has certain advantages over rubber 
and friction tape. For example, it can withstand higher voltages for a given thickness. Single thin layers of 
certain plastic tape will withstand several thousand volts without breaking down. However, to provide an 
extra margin of safety, several layers are usually wound over the splice. The extra layers of thin tape add 
very little bulk. The additional layers of plastic tape provide the added protection normally furnished by 
friction tape. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Plastic electrical tape usually has a certain amount of stretch so that it easily conforms to the contour 
of the splice.

</p><p class="question">Q10. Why is friction tape used in splicing? 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TERMINAL-LUGS-2-10-">TERMINAL LUGS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Since most cable wires are stranded, it is necessary to use terminal lugs to hold the strands together 
to aid in fastening the wires to terminal studs (see figure 2-11). The terminals used in electrical wiring are 
either of the soldered or crimped type. Terminals used in repair work must be of the size and type 
specified on the electrical wiring diagram for the particular equipment. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">2-11 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The increased use of crimp-on terminals is due to the limitations of soldered terminals. The quality 
of soldered connections depends mostly upon the operator's skill. Other factors, such as temperature, flux, 
cleanliness, oxides, and insulation damage due to heat, also add to defective connections. Solder-type 
connections are covered later in this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An advantage of the crimp-on solderless terminal lugs is that they require relatively little operator 
skill to use. Another advantage is that the only tool needed is the crimping tool. This allows terminal lugs 
to be applied with a minimum of time and effort. The connections are made rapidly, are clean, and 
uniform in construction. Because of the pressures exerted and the material used, the crimped connection 
or splice, properly made, is both mechanically and electrically sound. Some of the basic types of 
terminals are shown in figure 2-11. There are several variations of these basic types, such as the use of a 
slot instead of a terminal hole, three- and four-way splice-type connectors, and others. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the Navy uses both copper and aluminum wiring, both copper and aluminum terminals are 
necessary. Various size terminal or stud holes may be found for each of the different wire sizes. A further 
refinement of the solderless terminals and splices is the insulated type. The barrel of the terminal or splice 
is enclosed in an insulated material. The insulation is compressed along with the terminal barrel when it is 
crimped, but is not damaged in the process. This rids you of the need for taping or tying an insulating 
sleeve over the joint. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are several different types of crimping tools used with copper terminals. However, you will 
normally be concerned only with wire sizes AWG (American Wire Gauge) 10 or smaller. For wire of 
these sizes, a small plier-type crimper is used to crimp on uninsulated terminals, as shown in figure 2-12. 
The small plier-type crimper has several sizes of notches for the different size terminals. Care should be 
used to select the correct size crimping tool for the particular terminal. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

bare conductor. The two most common forms of insulator used for terminals and splices are transparent 
tubing (commonly called spaghetti) and heat-shrinkable tubing. If spaghetti is used, it must be tied with 
lacing twine, as illustrated in figure 2-13. Heat-shrinkable tubing is shrunk to the desirable size by 
applying dry heat. It is also a good way to insulate terminals and splices, as illustrated in figure 2-14. This 
tubing shrinks to approximately one-half its original diameter when heated with an electrical hot-air gun

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ALUMINUM-TERMINALS-AND-SPLICES-2-16-">ALUMINUM TERMINALS AND SPLICES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Terminals that are used with aluminum wire are made of aluminum. Proper crimping is more 
difficult with these terminals because of such factors as aluminum creep and softness. Aluminum wire has 
an undesirable characteristic called aluminum creep. Aluminum has the tendency to actually move away 
from the point where pressure is applied. This is not only true during the crimping operation but also 
takes place during temperature changes. The aluminum wire is softer than the terminal lugs and splice 
connectors and contracts faster than the connector when the temperature drops. This causes the wires to 
creep away from the crimped connections, which, in turn, causes loose connections. The softness of 
aluminum wire also makes it subject to being cut or nicked during stripping. You should be careful never 
to use an aluminum terminal with copper wire or a copper terminal with aluminum wire because of 
electrolysis. Electrolysis is the chemical action that takes place when an electric current passes through 
two dissimilar metals. This chemical action corrodes (eats away) the metal. Also, never use the aluminum 
crimping tool for crimping other than the aluminum terminals. Aluminum terminal lugs and splices are 
not insulated, so you must use spaghetti or heat-shrinkable tubing for insulation as discussed earlier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The barrels of several styles of larger size aluminum terminal lugs are filled with a petroleum 
abrasive compound. This compound causes a grinding action during the crimping operation. This 
removes the oxide film from the aluminum. It also prevents the oxide film from reforming in the 
connection. All aluminum terminals and splices have an inspection hole to allow checking the depth of 
wire insertion. This hole is sealed with a removable plug, which also serves to hold in the oxide-inhibiting 
compound (figure 2-17). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

This results in increased resistance, and the resistance causes heat. The heat accelerates deterioration, and 
eventually a failure results.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The following information will aid you in learning basic soldering skills. It should enable you to 
solder wires to electrical connectors, splices, and terminal lugs that we have discussed earlier in the 
chapter. Special skills and schooling are required for the soldering techniques used in printed circuit 
boards and microminiature component repair. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SOLDERING-PROCESS-2-24-">SOLDERING PROCESS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Cleanliness is essential for efficient, effective soldering. Solder will not adhere to dirty, greasy, or 
oxidized surfaces. Heated metals tend to oxidize rapidly. This is the reason the oxides, scale, and dirt 
must be removed by chemical or mechanical means. Grease or oil films can be removed with a suitable 
solvent. Connections to be soldered should be cleaned just prior to the actual soldering operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Items to be soldered should normally be "tinned" before making a mechanical connection. Tinning is 
the coating of the material to be soldered with a light coat of solder. When the surface has been properly 
cleaned, a thin, even coating of flux should be placed over the surface to be tinned. This will prevent 
oxidation while the part is being heated to soldering temperature. Rosin-core solder is usually preferred in 
electrical work. However, a separate rosin flux may be used instead. Separate rosin flux is frequently used 
when wires in cable fabrication are tinned. 
</p><p class="question">Q21. Why must items to be soldered be cleaned just prior to the soldering process? 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TINNING-COPPER-WIRE-AND-CABLE-2-24-">TINNING COPPER WIRE AND CABLE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Wires to be soldered to connectors should be stripped so that when the wire is placed in the barrel, 
there will be a gap of approximately 1/32 inch between the end of the barrel and the end of the insulation. 
This is done to prevent burning the insulation during the soldering process and to allow the wire to flex 
easier at a stress point. Before copper wires are soldered to connectors, the ends exposed by stripping are 
tinned to hold the strands solidly together. The tinning operation is satisfactory when the ends and sides 
of the wire strands are fused together with a coat of solder. Do not tin wires that are to be crimped to 
solderless terminals or splices. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Copper wires are usually tinned by dipping them into flux (view A of figure 2-25) and then into a 
solder bath (pot) (view B of the figure). In the field, copper wires can be tinned with a soldering iron and 
rosin-core solder. Tin the conductor for about half its exposed length. Tinning or solder on the wire above 
the barrel causes the wire to be stiff at the point where flexing takes place. This will result in the wire 
breaking. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

temperature of the solder bath (pot) between 450 and 500º F.  This keeps the solder in a liquid state. Skim

</p><h3 class="subsection">Soldering Irons 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Some common types of hand soldering irons are shown in figure 2-28. All high-quality soldering 
irons operate in the temperature range of 500 to 600º F. Even the 25-watt midget irons produce this 
temperature. The important difference in iron sizes is not temperature, but thermal inertia. Thermal inertia 
is the capacity of the iron to generate and maintain a satisfactory soldering temperature while giving up 
heat to the joint to be soldered. Although it is not practical to solder large conductors with the 25-watt 
iron, this iron is quite suitable for replacing a half-watt resistor in an electronic circuit or soldering a 
miniature connector. One advantage of using a small iron for small work is that it is light and easy to 
handle and has a small tip that is easily used in close places. Even though its temperature is high enough, 
a midget iron does not have the thermal inertia to solder large conductors. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A well-designed iron is self-regulating. The resistance of its element increases with rising 
temperature. This limits the flow of current. Some common tip shapes of the soldering irons in use in the 
Navy are shown in figure 2-29. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

soldering a component in a circuit. After extended use of an iron, the tip tends to become pitted due to 
oxidation. Pitting indicates the need for retinning. The tip is retinned after first filing the tip until it is 
smooth (see figure 2-30).

</p><h3 class="subsection">Soldering Gun 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The soldering gun (figure 2-31) has gained great popularity in recent years because it heats and cools 
rapidly. It is especially well adapted to maintenance and troubleshooting work where only a small part of 
the technician's time is spent actually soldering. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A transformer in the soldering gun supplies approximately 1 volt at high current to a loop of copper, 
which acts as the soldering tip. It heats to soldering temperature in 3 to 5 seconds. However, it may 
overheat to the point of incandescence if left on over 30 seconds. This should be avoided because excess 
heat will burn the insulation off the wiring. The gun is operated by a finger switch. The gun heats only 
while the switch is pressed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the gun normally operates only for short periods at a time, it is comparatively easy to keep 
clean and well tinned. Short operating time allows little oxidation to form. Because the tip is made of pure 
copper, it is likely to pit, due to the dissolving action of the solder. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The gun or iron should always be kept tinned to permit proper heat transfer to the connection to be 
soldered. Tinning also helps control the heat to prevent solder buildup on the tip. This control reduces the 
chance of the solder spilling over to nearby components and causing short circuits. Maintaining the proper 
tinning on the iron or gun, however, may be made easier by tinning with silver solder (a composition of 
silver, copper, and zinc). The temperature at which the bond is formed between the copper tip and the 
silver solder is much higher than with lead-tin solder. This tends to decrease the pitting action of the 
solder on the copper tip. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Overheating small or delicate wiring can easily occur when a soldering gun is used. For most jobs, 
even the LOW position of the trigger overheats the gun after 10 seconds. With practice, the heat can be 
controlled by pulsing the gun on and off with its trigger. The HIGH position is used only for fast heating 
and for soldering heavy connections. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When a soldering iron or gun is used, heating and cooling cycles tend to loosen the nuts or screws 
that hold the replaceable tips. When the nut on a gun becomes loose, the resistance of the tip connection 
increases. The temperature of the connection is increased, thus reducing the heat at the tip. Continued 
loosening may eventually cause an open circuit. Therefore, check and tighten the nut or screw, as needed. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUTION-2-31-">CAUTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Soldering guns should never be used to solder electronic components, such as 
resistors, capacitors, and transistors, because the heat generated can destroy the

</p><h3 class="subsection">Resistance Soldering Set 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A time-controlled resistance soldering set (figure 2-32) is now used at many maintenance activities. 
The set consists of a transformer that supplies 3 or 6 volts at a high current to stainless steel or carbon 
tips. The transformer is turned ON by a foot switch and OFF by an electronic timer. The timer can be 
adjusted for as long as 3 seconds soldering time. This set is especially useful for soldering cables to plugs 
and similar connectors; even the smallest types. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

during the brief period of actual soldering, burning of wire insulation and melting of connector inserts are 
greatly reduced. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The greatest difficulty with this device is keeping the probe tips free of rosin and corrosion. A 
cleaning block is mounted on the transformer case for this purpose. Some technicians prefer fine 
sandpaper for cleaning the double tips. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAUTION-2-32-">CAUTION

</p><h3 class="subsection">Pencil Iron and Special Tips 
</h3><p class="paragraph">An almost indispensable item is the pencil-type soldering iron with an assortment of tips (figure 2-
33). Miniature soldering irons have a wattage rating of less than 40 watts. They are easy to use, and are 
recommended for soldering small components, such as miniature connectors. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">One type of pencil iron is equipped with several different tips that range from one-fourth to one-half 
inch in size (diameter) and are of various shapes. This feature makes it adaptable to a variety of jobs. 
Unlike most tips that are held in place by setscrews, these tips have threads and screw into the barrel. This 
feature provides excellent contact with the heating element, thus improving heat transfer efficiency. 
"Antiseize" compound is generally applied to the threads of the tip each time a tip is installed into the 
iron. This allows the tip to be easily removed when another is to be inserted. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A special feature of this iron is the soldering pot that screws in like a tip and holds about a thimbleful 
of solder. It is useful for tinning the ends of a large number of wires. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The interchangeable tips are of various sizes and shapes for specific uses. Extra tips can be obtained 
and shaped to serve special purposes. The thread-in units are useful in soldering small items. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another advantage of the pencil soldering iron is that it can be used as an improvised light source to 
inspect the completed work. Simply remove the soldering tip and insert a 120-volt, 6-watt, type 6S6 lamp 
bulb into the socket. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If leads, tabs, or small wires are bent against a board or terminal, slotted tips are provided to 
simultaneously melt the solder and straighten the leads. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If no suitable tip is available for a particular operation, an improvised tip can be made (see figure 2-
34). Wrap a length of bare copper wire around one of the regular tips and bend the wire into the proper 
shape for the purpose. This method also serves to reduce thermal inertia when a larger iron must be used 
on small components.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SOLDER-2-33-">SOLDER 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Any discussion of soldering techniques should include an explanation of solder itself. Ordinary soft 
solder is a fusible alloy consisting chiefly of tin and lead. It is used to join two or more metals at 
temperatures below their melting point. In addition to tin and lead, soft solders occasionally contain 
varying amounts of antimony, bismuth, cadmium, or silver. These are added to change the melting point 
or physical properties of the alloy. Ordinary table salt has to be heated to 1,488º F before it melts. 
However, when a little water is added, it dissolves easily at room temperature. The action of molten 
solder on a metal like copper may be compared to the action of water on salt. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The solder bonds the connection by dissolving a small amount of the copper at temperatures quite 
below its melting point. Thus, the soldering process involves a metal solvent action between the solder </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">and the metal being joined. A solder joint is therefore chemical in nature rather than purely physical. The 
bond is formed in part by chemical action and part by a physical bond. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The properties of a solder joint are different from those of the original solder. The solder is converted 
to a new and different alloy through the solvent action. Two metals soldered together behave like one 
solid metal. It is unlike two metals bolted, wired, or otherwise physically attached. These types of 
connections are still two pieces of metal. They are not even in direct contact due to an insulating film of 
oxide on the surfaces of the metals. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Temperature change does not affect the solder alloy. It withstands stress and strains without 
damaging the joint. An unsoldered connection eventually becomes loosened by small movements caused 
by temperature variations and by the gradual buildup of oxides on the metal surfaces. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To understand fully the alloy or solvent action on molten solder, look at the tin-lead fusion diagram 
shown in figure 2-35. This diagram shows that pure lead (point A) melts at 621º F. Point C shows the 
lowest melting point of the tin and lead alloy. The alloy at point C consists of 63-percent tin (SN63) and 
37-percent lead. This is commonly called 63/37 solder. It has a melting point of 361º F. This type of 
solder, because of its very low melting point, is used in printed circuit boards and microminiature 
electronic repair. As you can see from the chart, the melting point of the alloy is lowered when tin is 
added to lead. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The solder used to solder wires to electrical connectors, splices, and terminal lugs is a combination 
of 60-percent tin to 40-percent lead (60/40 solder). The melting point of 60/40 solder is 370º F, as shown 
at point B of the figure. Type 60/40 solder is less expensive than 63/37 solder and is suitable for all 
general uses.

</h2><p class="paragraph">As you know, flux is a cleaning agent to remove oxidation during soldering. Heating a metal causes 
rapid oxidation. Oxidation prevents solder from reacting chemically with a metal. Flux cleans the metal 
by removing the oxide layer. This operation is shown in figure 2-36. As the iron is moved in the direction 
shown, the boiling flux floats away the oxide film. The molten solder following the iron then fuses 
rapidly with the clean surface of the metal. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two classes of flux: corrosive and noncorrosive. Zinc chloride, hydrochloric acid, and sal 
ammoniac are corrosive fluxes. Corrosive flux should NEVER be used in electrical or electronic repair 
work. Use only rosin fluxes. Any flux remaining in the joint corrodes the connection and creates a 
defective circuit. Rosin is a noncorrosive flux and is available in paste, liquid, or powder form.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Soldering Aids 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Some type of heat shunt must be used in all soldering operations that involve heat-sensitive 
components. A typical heat shunt (figure 2-37) permits soldering the leads of component parts without 
overheating the part itself. The heat shunt should be attached carefully to prevent damage to the leads, 
terminals, or component parts. The shunt should be clipped to the lead, between the joint and the part 
being protected. As the joint is heated, the shunt absorbs the excess heat before it can reach the part and 
cause damage. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A small piece of beeswax may be placed between the protected unit and the heat shunt. When the 
beeswax begins to melt, the temperature limit has been reached. The heat source should be removed 
immediately, but the shunt should be left in place. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Removing the shunt too soon permits the heat to flow from the melted solder into the component. 
The shunt should be allowed to remain in place until it cools to room temperature. A clip-on shunt is 
preferred because it requires positive action for removal. It does not require that the technician maintain 
pressure to hold it in place. This leaves both hands free to solder the connection.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Conductors within equipment must be kept in place to present a neat appearance and aid in tracing 
the conductors when alterations or repairs are required. This is done by LACING the conductors into wire 
bundles called cables. An example of lacing is shown in figure 2-39. When conductors are properly laced, 
they support each other and form a neat, single cable. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A narrow, flat tape should be used wherever possible for lacing and tying. This tape is not an 
adhesive type of tape. Round cord may also be used, but its use is not preferred because cord has a 
tendency to cut into wire insulation. Use cotton, linen, nylon, or glass fiber cord or tape, according to the 
temperature requirements. Cotton or linen cord or tape must be prewaxed to make it moisture and fungus 
resistant. Nylon cord or tape may be waxed or unwaxed; glass fiber cord or tape is usually not waxed.

operation. A shuttle similar to the one shown in figure 2-40 can easily be made from aluminum, brass, 
fiber, or plastic scrap. Rough edges of the material used for the shuttle should be filed smooth to prevent 
injury to the operator and damage to the cord. To fill the shuttle for a single lace, measure the cord, cut it, 
and wind it on the shuttle. For double lace, proceed as before, except double the length of the cord before 
you wind it on the shuttle. For double lace, start both ends of the cord or tape on the shuttle in order to 
leave a loop for starting the lace. This procedure is explained later in the chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Some equipment requires the use of twisted wires. One example is the use of "twisted pairs" for the 
ac filament leads of certain electron tube amplifiers to minimize radiation of their magnetic field. This 
prevents an annoying hum in the amplifier output. You should duplicate the original layout when relacing 
any wiring harness. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Lace or tie bundles tightly enough to prevent slipping, but not so tightly that the cord or tape cuts 
into or deforms the insulation. Be especially careful when lacing or tying coaxial cable. Coaxial cable is a 
conductor used primarily for radio-frequency transmission. It consists of a center conductor separated 
from an outer conductor (usually called a shield) by an insulating dielectric. The dielectric maintains a 
constant capacitance between the two conductors, which is very important in radio transmission. The 
dielectric is soft and deforms easily if tied too tightly or with the wrong type of tape.

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY 
</h1><p class="paragraph">In this chapter you have learned some of the basic skills required for proper wiring techniques. We 
have discussed conductor splices and terminal connections, basic soldering skills, and lacing and tying 
wire bundles. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic requirement for any splice or terminal connection is that it be both mechanically and 
electrically as strong as the conductor or device with which it is to be used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Insulation Removal—The first step in splicing or terminating electrical conductors is to remove the 
insulation. The preferred method for stripping wire is by use of a wire-stripping tool. The hot-blade 
stripper cannot be used on such insulation material as glass braid or asbestos. An alternate method for 
stripping copper wire is with a knife. A knife is the required tool to strip aluminum wire. Take extreme 
care when stripping aluminum wire. Knicking the strands will cause them to break easily. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Western Union Splice—A simple connection known as the Western Union splice is used to splice 
small, solid conductors together. After the splice is made, the ends of the wire are clamped down to 
prevent damage to the tape insulation.

</p><p class="paragraph">Staggered Splice—The staggered splice is used on multiconductor cables to prevent the joint from 
being bulky. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Rattail Joint—A splice that is used in a junction box and for connecting branch circuits; wiring is 
placed inside conduits. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Fixture Joint—When conductors of different sizes are to be spliced, such as fixture wires to a 
branch circuit, the fixture joint is used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Knotted Tap Joint—This type of splice is used to splice a conductor to a continuous wire. It is not 
considered a "butted" splice as the ones previously discussed. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Splice Insulation—Rubber tape is an insulator for the type of splices we have discussed so far. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Friction Tape—It has very little insulating value but is used as a protective covering for the rubber 
tape. Another type of insulating tape is plastic electrical tape, which is quite expensive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Terminal Lugs—The terminals used in electrical wiring are either of the soldered or crimped type. 
The advantage of using a crimped type of connection is that it requires very little operator skill, whereas 
the soldered connection is almost completely dependent on the skill of the operator. Some form of 
insulation must be used with noninsulated splices and terminal lugs. The types used are clear plastic 
tubing (spaghetti) and heat-shrinkable tubing. When a heat gun is used to shrink the heat-shrinkable 
tubing, the maximum allowable heat to be used is 300º F. When using the compressed air/nitrogen 
heating tool, the air/nitrogen source cannot be greater than 200 psig. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Aluminum Terminals and Splices—Aluminum terminals and splices are noninsulated and very 
difficult to use. Some of the things you should remember when working with aluminum wire are: (1) 
Never attempt to clean the aluminum wire. There is a petroleum abrasive compound in the terminal lug or 
splice that automatically cleans the wire. (2) The only tools that should be used for the crimping operation 
are the power crimping type. (3) Never use lock washers next to aluminum terminal lugs as they will 
gouge out the tinned area and increase deterioration. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Preinsulated Copper Terminal Lugs and Splices—The most common method of terminating and 
splicing copper wires is with the use of preinsulated terminal lugs and splices. Besides not having to 
insulate the terminal or splice after the crimping operation, the other advantage of this type is that it gives 
extra wire insulation support. Several types of crimping tools can be used for these types of terminals and 
splices. The tool varies with the size of the terminal or splice. Preinsulated terminal lugs and splices are 
color coded to indicate the wire size they are to be used with.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Soldering—The basic skills required to solder terminal lugs, splices, and electrical connectors are 
covered in this area. Prior to any soldering operation, the items to be soldered must be cleaned; they will 
not adhere to dirty, greasy, or oxidized surfaces. The next step is the "tinning" process. This process is 
accomplished by coating the material to be soldered with a bright coat of solder. The wire to be soldered 
must be stripped to 1/32 inch longer than the depth of the solder cup of the terminal, splice, or connector 
to which it is to be soldered. This is to prevent burning the insulation. It also allows the wire to flex at the 
stress point. When you tin the wire, it should be done to one-half of the stripped length. When soldering a 
connection, take precaution to prevent movement of the parts while the solder is cooling. A "fractured 
solder" joint will result if this precaution is not taken. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Soldering Tools—The important difference in soldering iron sizes is not the temperature (they all 
produce 500º F to 600º F), but the thermal inertia. Thermal inertia is the ability of soldering tools to 
maintain a satisfactory soldering temperature while giving up heat to the joint to be soldered. A well-
designed soldering iron is self-regulating because its heating element increases with the rising 
temperature, thus inciting the current to a satisfactory level. When using a soldering gun, do not press the 
switch for periods longer than 30 seconds. Doing so will cause the tip to overheat to the point of 
incandescence. The nuts or screws that retain the tips on soldering irons and guns tend to loosen because 
of the continuous heating and cooling cycles. Therefore, they should be tightened periodically. You 
should never use a soldering gun on electronics components, such as resistors, capacitors, or transistors. 
An advantage of using a resistance soldering iron to solder a wire to a connector is that the soldering tips 
are only hot during the brief period of soldering the connection. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Solder—Ordinary soft solder is a fusible alloy of tin and lead used to join two or more metals at 
temperatures below their melting point. The metal solvent action that occurs when copper conductors are 
soldered together takes place because a small amount of the copper combines with the solder to form a 
new alloy. Therefore, the joint is one common metal. The tin-lead alloy used for general-purpose 
soldering is composed of 60-percent tin and 40-percent lead (60/40 solder). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Flux—Flux is used in the soldering process to clean the metal by removing the oxide layer on the 
metal and to prevent further oxidation during the soldering process. Always use noncorrosive, 
nonconducting rosin fluxes when soldering electrical and electronic components. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Solvents—Solvents are used in the soldering process to remove contaminants from the surfaces to be 
soldered. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Soldering Aids—Use a heat shunt when you solder heat-sensitive components. It dissipates the heat, 
thereby preventing damage to the heat-sensitive component. Some type of soldering iron holder or guard 
should be used to prevent the operator from being burned. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Lacing Conductors—The purpose of lacing conductors is to present a neat appearance and to 
facilitate tracing the conductors when alterations or repairs are required. Flat tape is preferred for lacing 
instead of round cord. Cord has a tendency to cut into the wire insulation. The amount of flat tape or 
round cord required to lace a group of conductors is about two and one-half times the length of the 
longest conductor. A lacing shuttle is useful during the lacing operation to prevent the tape or cord from 
fouling. Wires should only be twisted prior to lacing if it is required, such as for filament leads in electron 
tube amplifiers. When lacing wire bundles containing coaxial cables, use the proper flat tape and do not 
tie the bundles too tightly. Never use round cord on coaxial cable. A single lace is started with a square 
knot and at least two marling Hitches. A double lace is required for wire bundles that are 1 inch or more 
in diameter. It is started with a telephone hitch. Cable groups are bound together by use of telephone hitch

</p><h3 class="subsection">Aircraft Wire-Marking Systems 
</h3><p class="paragraph">All aircraft wiring is identified on wiring diagrams exactly as the wire is marked in the aircraft. Each 
</p><h3 class="subsection">wire is coded by a combination of letters and numbers (figure 3-3) imprinted on the wire at prescribed 
</h3><p class="paragraph">intervals along the wire run. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at figure 3-3. The circuit function letter (P in this example) identifies the basic function of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">circuit concerned. The letter P indicates that the wire is in the dc power distribution system of the aircraft. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The wire number, 215, indicates that it is the 215th wire in the dc distribution system. The wire segment 
</p><p class="paragraph">letter (A) identifies the position of each wire segment of the circuit. The wire segments are lettered in 
</p><p class="paragraph">alphabetical sequence and change each time the wire passes through a terminal or connector. For 
</p><h3 class="subsection">example, after the wire passes through the first terminal or connector, the segment letter A, as in this 
</h3><p class="paragraph">instance, would change to B. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The wire size number (4) is the AN wire size. AN wire sizes have more strands for flexibility and are 
</p><p class="paragraph">slightly different in circular mil area than AWG (American Wire Gauge) wire sizes. The current-carrying 
</p><p class="paragraph">capacity of each is almost the same. The last letter (N) is the ground or phase letter. The letter N identifies 
</p><p class="paragraph">any wire that completes the circuit to the ground network of the aircraft. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">In a 3-phase ac power distribution system, a phase letter (A, B, or C) is used as the last letter of the

</p><h3 class="subsection">On the conductor lead, at the end near the point of connection to a terminal post, spaghetti sleeving is 
</h3><p class="paragraph">used as a marking material and an insulator. The sleeving is marked with identifying numbers and letters 
</p><p class="paragraph">and then slid over the conductor. The marking on the sleeving identifies the conductor connections both 
</p><p class="paragraph">"to" and "from" by giving the following information (figure 3-4): 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The terminal "from" 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">The terminal board "to" 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The terminal "to." 
</p><p class="paragraph">These designations on the sleeving are separated by a dash. The order of the markings is such that 
</p><h3 class="subsection">the first set of numbers and letters reading from left to right is the designation corresponding to the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">terminal "from" which the conductor runs. Following this is the number of the terminal board "to" which 
</p><p class="paragraph">the conductor runs. ("TB" is omitted when the sleeve is marked.) The third designation is the terminal  
</p><p class="paragraph">"to" which the conductor runs. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">For example, as shown in figure 3-4, the conductor is attached to terminal 2A of terminal board 101 
</h3><p class="paragraph">(terminal "from" 2A on the spaghetti sleeving). The next designation on the sleeving is 401, indicating it 
</p><p class="paragraph">is going "to" terminal board 401. The last designation is 7B, indicating it is attached "to" terminal 7B of 
</p><p class="paragraph">TB 401. The spaghetti marking on the other end of the conductor is read the same way. The conductor is 
</p><p class="paragraph">going "from" terminal 7B on terminal board 401 "to" terminal 2A on terminal board 101. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">On occasion, it may be necessary to run conductors to units that have no terminal board numbers; for 
</h3><p class="paragraph">example, a junction box. In this case, an easily recognizable abbreviation may be used in place of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">terminal board number on the spaghetti sleeving. The designation "JB2" indicates that the conductor is 
</p><p class="paragraph">connected to junction box No. 2. A conductor to junction box No. 2 of a piece of equipment would be 
</p><p class="paragraph">identified as shown in figure 3-5. In the same manner, a plug would be identified as "P." This P number 
</p><p class="paragraph">would be substituted for the terminal board number marking on the sleeving. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The battery is the initial source of power for the starter and ignition systems. The starter is turned by 
</p><p class="paragraph">power from the battery when the ignition switch is turned to the START position. Power is also supplied,

</p><p class="paragraph">the spark plugs for ignition. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Once the engine is running, the starter is no longer required. The running engine acts as the prime 
</p><p class="paragraph">mover for the alternator. (This is accomplished through a belt and pulley system attached to the engine's

</p><p class="paragraph">and the instrument lights have +12 volts applied. The opposite side of each light is grounded. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">instrument panel lights are grounded through the dimming rheostat. This completes the path for current 
</p><h3 class="subsection">flow from the negative side of the battery, through all the light bulbs (lamps), back to the positive side of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the battery. If no faults exist, the lamps will light. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">When the light switch is pulled to the next position (on), the bar on the switch contacts the "off," 
</h3><p class="paragraph">"park," and "on" contacts of the switch. The lights that were illuminated before are still on, and the + 12 
</p><p class="paragraph">volt potential is now applied to the bright (B) side of the headlights through the dimmer switch. Since the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">headlights are also grounded on one side, there is now a complete path for current flow, and the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">headlights also light. If the dimmer switch is actuated, the positive potential is switched from the bright 
</p><p class="paragraph">filament to the dim filament of the headlights, and the lights dim. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The brake-light switch has +12 volts applied from point (1), directly to the stop lights (not fused). If 
</p><p class="paragraph">the brake pedal is pressed, the switch is actuated, and the +12 volts are applied to both stop lights (S). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because one side of each light is tied to ground, there is a path for current flow, and the lights will light. If 
</p><h3 class="subsection">the dimming rheostat for the instrument lights is turned in the direction that increases the resistance, more 
</h3><p class="paragraph">voltage is dropped across the rheostat, less across the lights, and the lights will get dimmer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The +12 volts at point (1) are also supplied to the OFF position of the ignition switch. When the 
</p><p class="paragraph">ignition switch is turned on, the +12 volts are felt at point (3). This is a common point to all the engine 
</p><p class="paragraph">instruments. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The gas gauge is a galvanometer with the dial graduated according to the amount of fuel in the tank. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The gas gauge tank unit is a rheostat mechanically linked to a float in the gas tank. When the tank is full, 
</p><h3 class="subsection">the float rises to its highest level and positions the movable arm of the rheostat to a position of minimum 
</h3><p class="paragraph">resistance. This allows maximum current flow through the galvanometer, and the dial rests at the "full" 
</p><p class="paragraph">mark on the gas gauge. As fuel is used by the engine, the float lowers, increasing the resistance of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">rheostat to ground. This reduces the current through the galvanometer, and the dial shows a lesser amount 
</p><p class="paragraph">of fuel. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The oil-pressure light gets its ground through a normally closed pressure switch. (When no pressure 
</p><p class="paragraph">is applied, the switch is closed.) When the engine is started, the oil pressure increases and opens the 
</p><p class="paragraph">switch. This turns the light off by removing the ground. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The water-temperature gauge is a galvanometer like the gas gauge, except its dial is graduated in 
</h3><p class="paragraph">degrees of temperature. The water-temperature element is a thermistor with a negative temperature 
</p><p class="paragraph">coefficient. (A thermistor is a semiconductor device whose resistance varies with temperature.) When the 
</p><p class="paragraph">engine is cold, the resistance of the thermistor is at a maximum. This reduces the current through the 
</p><p class="paragraph">galvanometer, and a low temperature is indicated on the dial. As the water temperature of the engine 
</p><p class="paragraph">increases, the resistance of the thermistor decreases. This allows more current to flow from ground 
</p><p class="paragraph">through the galvanometer, and the temperature on the dial shows an increase. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">On the voltage regulator shown, the "T" terminal is grounded anytime the alternator does not have an 
</h3><p class="paragraph">output. This gives the alternator light a ground and causes it to illuminate.

</p><p class="paragraph">light. Referring to the schematic diagram (figure 3-10), you will recall that when the light switch is placed 
</p><p class="paragraph">in the PARK position, +12 volts are applied to point (2). If all the lights come on except the tag light, then 
</p><p class="paragraph">the fault must be between point (2) and the tag light ground. 
</p><p class="paragraph">On the schematic shown in figure 3-11, you can see that there are numerous connections to point (2). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Point (2) on the wiring diagram is actually composed of three different functions: terminal 1 of TB 1 (the 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">head lamp junction block), terminals 1 and 2 of TB2 (the tail lamp junction block), and the "T" terminal 
</h3><p class="paragraph">of the light switch; all correspond to point (2) on the schematic. The fault here is in the tag light, which 
</p><p class="paragraph">normally receives its +12 volts from terminal 1 of TB2. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">To use a voltmeter to find the fault, place the positive lead of the voltmeter to the ground terminal of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the tag light and the negative lead to the frame. The voltmeter should read zero, because there should be 
</p><p class="paragraph">no difference of potential between the two points. If the meter reads a voltage, the ground lead is either 
</p><p class="paragraph">open or has a high-resistance connection. If the meter reads zero, as it should, you will have to go to 
</p><p class="paragraph">another test point. In this case, place the positive voltmeter lead on the positive terminal of the tail light. If 
</p><p class="paragraph">the voltmeter reads +12 volts, the light bulb is probably burned out or the light socket is defective. If the

</p><p class="paragraph">hours, even in the absence of treatment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the largest uses of fluoroplastics is as a wire and cable insulation. When insulated wiring is

</h3><p class="paragraph">make this connection when the plug is inserted into the receptacle, must be used. These grounded-type 
</p><p class="paragraph">receptacles must be installed for all power outlets. When installed, they must be used with the grounded-
</p><p class="paragraph">type plugs to ground portable tools and equipment. If grounded-type receptacles have not yet been

</p><h3 class="subsection">plug, and miscellaneous portable electric equipment that does not have a cord with a ground conductor

</p><p class="paragraph">ground wire must be connected to a positive ground. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Care must be exercised in connecting the plugs and cords. The grounding conductor of the cord must 
</p><h3 class="subsection">be connected to the ground contact of the plug at one end and to the metal equipment housing at the other

</p><h3 class="subsection">grounding, an additional insulated wire should be connected between the metal housing of the tool and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">ground. If the tool housing has two or more conducting parts that are not electrically connected, each part 
</p><p class="paragraph">must be connected to the ground wire. Connection of the ground wire to the tool housing and to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">ground must be by means of screws or bolts. The use of spring clips for either end of the grounding wire 
</p><p class="paragraph">is prohibited. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">When the ground connection is to be made by means other than a contact in the plug and receptacle,
