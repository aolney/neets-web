SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current
(dc). It also describes some of the general safety precautions and first-aid procedures that should be

only been desired from a social point of view, but have been an essential element in the building of 
civilization. Through communications, people have been able to share ideas of mutual benefit to all 
mankind. Early attempts to maintain communications between distant points were limited by several 
factors. For example, the relatively short distance sound would carry and the difficulty of hand-carrying 
messages over great distances hampered effective communications. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">As the potential for the uses of electricity were explored, scientists in the United States and England 
worked to develop the telegraph. The first practical system was established in London, England, in 1838. 
Just 20 years later, the final link to connect the major countries with electrical communications was 
completed when a transatlantic submarine cable was connected. Commercial telegraphy was practically 
worldwide by 1890. The telegraph key, wire lines, and Morse code made possible almost instantaneous 
communications between points at great distances. Submarine cables solved the problems of transoceanic 
communications, but communications with ships at sea and mobile forces were still poor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In 1897 Marconi demonstrated the first practical wireless transmitter. He sent and received messages 
over a distance of 8 miles. By 1898 he had demonstrated the usefulness of wireless telegraph 
communications at sea. In 1899 he established a wireless telegraphic link across the English Channel. His 
company also established general usage of the wireless telegraph between coastal light ships (floating 
lighthouses) and land. The first successful transatlantic transmissions were achieved in 1902. From that 
time to the present, radio communication has grown at an extraordinary rate. Early systems transmitted a 
few words per minute with doubtful reliability. Today, communications systems reliably transmit 
information across millions of miles. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The desire to communicate directly by voice, at a higher rate of speed than possible through basic 
telegraphy, led to further research. That research led to the development of MODULATION. Modulation 
is the ability to impress intelligence upon a TRANSMISSION MEDIUM, such as radio waves. A 
transmission medium can be described as light, smoke, sound, wire lines, or radio-frequency waves. In 
this module, you will study the basic principles of modulation and DEMODULATION (removing 
intelligence from the medium). 
</p><p class="paragraph">In your studies, you will learn about modulation as it applies to radio-frequency communications. To 
modulate is to impress the characteristics (intelligence) of one waveform onto a second waveform by 
varying the amplitude, frequency, phase, or other characteristics of the second waveform. First, however, 
you will review the characteristics and generation of a sine wave. This review will help you to better 
understand the principles of modulation. Then, an important principle called HETERODYNING (mixing 
two frequencies across a nonlinear impedance) will be studied and applied to modulation. Nonlinear 
impedance will be discussed in the heterodyning section. You will also study several methods of 
modulating a radio-frequency carrier. You will come to a better understanding of the demodulation 
principle by studying the various circuits used to demodulate a modulated carrier.

have magnitude and direction. This may be done by using an arrow and a number, as illustrated in figure 
1-1, view (A). The number represents the magnitude of force and the arrow represents the direction of the

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">View (B) illustrates a simpler method of representation. In this method, the length of the arrow is 
proportional to the magnitude of force, and the direction of force is indicated by the direction of the

represent 100 pounds of force. This method of showing both magnitude and direction is called a 
VECTOR. To more clearly show the relationships between the amplitude, phase, and frequency of a sine 
wave, we will use vectors.

</h3><p class="paragraph">As covered, in NEETS, Module 2, Introduction to Alternating Current and Transformers, an 
alternating current is generated by rotating a coil in the magnetic field between two magnets. As long as 
the magnetic field is uniform, the output from the coil will be a sine wave, as shown in figure 1-2. This 
wave shape is called a sine wave because the voltage of the coil depends on its angular position in the 
magnetic field. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When an alternating waveform is generated, the coil is represented by a vector which has a length 
that is equal to the maximum output voltage (Emax). The output voltage at any given angle can be found by 
applying the above trigonometric function. Because the output voltage is in direct relationship with the 
sine of the angle !, it is commonly called a sine wave. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You can see this relationship more clearly in figure 1-3 where the coil positions in relation to time 
are represented by the numbers 0 through 12. The corresponding angular displacements, shown as !, are 
shown along the horizontal time axis. The induced voltages (V1 through V12) are plotted along this axis. 
Connecting the induced voltage points, shown in the figure, forms a sine-wave pattern. This relationship 
can be proven by taking any coil position and applying the trigonometric function to an equivalent right 
triangle. When the vector is placed horizontally (position 0), the angle ! is 0 degrees. Since e = Emax sine 
!, and the sine of 0 degrees is 0, the output voltage is 0 volts, as shown below:

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-AMPLITUDE-1-7-">AMPLITUDE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A sine wave is used to represent values of electrical current or voltage. The greater its height, the 
greater the value it represents. As you have studied, a sine wave alternately rises above and then falls 
below the reference line. That part above the line represents a positive value and is referred to as a 
POSITIVE ALTERNATION. That part of the cycle below the line has a negative value and is referred to 
as a NEGATIVE ALTERNATION. The maximum value, above or below the reference line, is called the 
PEAK AMPLITUDE. The value at any given point along the reference line is called the 
INSTANTANEOUS AMPLITUDE. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PHASE-1-7-">PHASE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">PHASE or PHASE ANGLE indicates how much of a cycle has been completed at any given instant. 
This merely describes the angle that exists between the starting point of the vector and its position at that 
instant. The number of degrees of vector rotation and the number of degrees of the resultant sine wave 
that have been completed will be the same. For example, at time position 2 of figure 1-3, the vector has 
rotated to 60 degrees and 60 degrees of the resultant sine wave has been completed. Therefore, both are 
said to have an instantaneous phase angle of 60 degrees. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FREQUENCY-1-7-">FREQUENCY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The rate at which the vector rotates determines the FREQUENCY of the sine wave that is generated; 
that is, the faster the vector rotates, the more cycles completed in a given time period. The basic time 
period used is 1 second. If a vector completes one revolution per 1 second, the resultant sine wave has a 
frequency 1 cycle per second (1 hertz). If the rate of rotation is increased to 1,000 revolutions per second, 
the frequency of the sine wave generated will be 1,000 cycles per second (1 kilohertz). 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PERIOD-1-7-">PERIOD 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Another term that is important in the discussion of a sine wave is its duration, or PERIOD. The 
period of a cycle is the elapsed time from the beginning of a cycle to its completion. If the vector shown 
in figure 1-3 were to make 1 revolution per second, each cycle of the resultant sine wave would have a 
period of 1 second. If it were rotating at a speed of 1,000 revolutions per second, each revolution would 
require 1/1,000 of a second and the period of the resultant sine wave would be 1/1,000 of a second. This 
illustrates that the period is related to the frequency. As the number of cycles completed in 1 second 
increases, the period of each cycle will decrease proportionally. This relationship is shown in the 
following formulas:

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WAVELENGTH-1-8-">WAVELENGTH 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The WAVELENGTH of a sine wave is determined by its physical length. During the period a wave 
is being generated, its leading edge is moving away from the source at 300,000,000 meters per second. 
The physical length of the sine wave is determined by the amount of time it takes to complete one full 
cycle. This wavelength is an important factor in determining the size of equipments used to generate and 
transmit radio frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To help you understand the magnitude of the distance a wavefront (the initial part of a wave) travels 
during 1 cycle, we will compute the wavelengths (l;) of several frequencies. Consider a vector that rotates 
at 1 revolution per second. The resultant sine wave is transmitted into space by an antenna. As the vector 
moves from its 0-degree starting position, the wavefront begins to travel away from the antenna. When 
the vector reaches the 360-degree position, and the sine wave is completed, the sine wave is stretched out 
over 300,000,000 meters. The reason the sine wave is stretched over such a great distance is that the 
wavefront has been moving away from the antenna at 300,000,000 meters per second. This is shown in 
the following example: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">If a vector were rotating at 1,000 revolutions per second, its period would be 0.001 second. By 
applying the formula for wavelength, you would find that the wavelength is 300,000 meters:

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HETERODYNING-1-10-">HETERODYNING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Information waveforms are produced by many different sources and are generally quite low in 
frequency. A good example is the human voice. The frequencies involved in normal speech vary from one 
individual to another and cover a wide range. This range can be anywhere from a low of about 90 hertz 
for a deep bass to as high as 10 kilohertz for a high soprano. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The most important speech frequencies almost entirely fall below 3 kilohertz. Higher frequencies 
merely help to achieve more perfect sound production. The range of frequencies used to transmit voice 
intelligence over radio circuits depends on the degree of FIDELITY (the ability to faithfully reproduce the 
input in the output) that is desired. The minimum frequency range that can be used for the transmission of 
speech is 500 to 2,000 hertz. The average range used on radiotelephone circuits is 250 to 2,750 hertz. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Frequencies contained within the human voice can be transmitted over telephone lines without 
difficulty, but transmitting them via radio circuits is not practical. This is because of their extremely long 
wavelengths and the fact that antennas would have to be constructed with long physical dimensions to 
transmit or radiate these wavelengths. Generally, antennas have radiating elements that are 1/4, 1/2, 1, or 
more full wavelengths of the frequency to be radiated. The wavelengths of voice frequencies employed on 
radiotelephone circuits range from 1,200,000 meters at 250 hertz to 109,090 meters at 2,750 hertz. Even a 
quarter-wave antenna would require a large area, be expensive to construct, and consume enormous 
amounts of power. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As studied in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission Lines, and 
Antennas, radio frequencies do not have the limitations just described for voice frequencies. Radio waves, 
given a suitable antenna, can often radiate millions of miles into space. Several methods of modulation 
can be used to impress voices frequencies onto radio waves for transmission through space. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the modulation process, waves from the information source are impressed onto a radio-frequency 
sine wave called a CARRIER. This carrier is sufficiently high in frequency to have a wavelength short 
enough to be radiated from an antenna of practical dimensions. For example, a carrier frequency of 10 
megahertz has a wavelength of 30 meters, as shown below: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Construction of an antenna related to that wavelength does not cause any problems. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An information wave is normally referred to as a MODULATING WAVE. When a modulating wave 
is impressed on a carrier, the voltages of the modulating wave and the carrier are combined in such a 
manner as to produce a COMPLEX WAVE (a wave composed of two or more parts). This complex wave </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the modulated wave is received and demodulated, the original component waves (carrier and modulating 
waves) are reproduced with their respective frequencies, phases, and amplitudes unchanged. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Modulation of a carrier can be achieved by any of several methods. Generally, the methods are 
named for the sine-wave characteristic that is altered by the modulation process. In this module, you will 
study AMPLITUDE MODULATION, which includes CONTINUOUS-WAVE MODULATION. You 
will also learn about two forms of ANGLE MODULATION (FREQUENCY MODULATION and 
PHASE MODULATION). A special type of modulation, known as PULSE MODULATION, will also be 
discussed. Before we present the methods involved in developing modulation, you need to study a process 
that is essential to the modulation of a carrier, known as heterodyning. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To help you understand the operation of heterodyning circuits, we will begin with a discussion of 
LINEAR and NONLINEAR devices. In linear devices, the output rises and falls directly with the input. In 
nonlinear devices, the output does not rise and fall directly with the input. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LINEAR-IMPEDANCE-1-11-">LINEAR IMPEDANCE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Whether the impedance of a device is linear or nonlinear can be determined by comparing the 
change in current through the device to the change in voltage applied to the device. The simple circuit 
shown in view (A) of figure 1-4 is used to explain this process. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">First, the current through the device must be measured as the voltage is varied. Then the current and 
voltage values can be plotted on a graph, such as the one shown in view (B), to determine the impedance 
of the device. For example, assume the voltage is varied from 0 to 200 volts in 50-volt steps, as shown in 
view (B). At the first 50-volt point, the ammeter reads 0.5 ampere. These ordinates are plotted as point a 
in view (B). With 100 volts applied, the ammeter reads 1 ampere; this value is plotted as point b. As these 
steps are continued, the values are plotted as points c and d. These points are connected with a straight 
line to show the linear relationship between current and voltage. For every change in voltage applied to 
the device, a proportional change occurs in the current through the device. When the change in current is 
proportional to the change in applied voltage, the impedance of the device is linear and a straight line is 
developed in the graph. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The principle of linear impedance can be extended by connecting two impedance devices in series, 
as shown in figure 1-5, view (A). The characteristics of both individual impedances are determined as 
explained in the preceding section. For example, assume voltmeter V1 shows 50 volts and the ammeter 
shows 0.5 ampere. Point a in view (B) represents this ordinate. In the same manner, increasing the voltage 
in increments of 50 volts gives points b, c, and d. Lines Z1 and Z2 show the characteristics of the two 
impedances. The total voltage of the series combination can be determined by adding the voltages across 
Z1 and Z2. For example, at 0.5 ampere, point a (50 volts) plus point e (75 volts) produces point i (125 
volts). Also, at 1 ampere, point b plus point f produces point j. Line Z1 + Z2 represents the combined 
voltage-current characteristics of the two devices.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Amplitude modulation refers to any method of varying the amplitude of an electromagnetic carrier 
frequency in accordance with the intelligence to be transmitted by the carrier. The CARRIER frequency is 
a radio-frequency wave suitable for modulation by the intelligence to be transmitted. One form of this 
method of modulation is simply to interrupt the carrier in accordance with a prearranged code. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">CONTINUOUS WAVE (CW) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The "on-off" KEYING of a continuous wave (cw) carrier frequency was the principal method of 
modulating a carrier in the early days of electrical communications. The intervals of time when a carrier 
either was present or absent conveyed the desired intelligence. This is still used in modern 
communications. When applied to a continuously oscillating radio-frequency source, on-off keying is 
referred to as cw signaling. This type of communication is sometimes referred to as an interrupted 
continuous wave (icw). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Development 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The use of a cw transmitter can be very simple. All that is required for the transmitter to work 
properly is a device to generate the oscillations, a method of keying the oscillations on and off, and an 
antenna to radiate the energy. Continuous wave was the first type of modulation used. It is still 
extensively used for long-range communications. When Marconi and others were attempting the transfer 
of intelligence between two points, without reliance on a conducting path, they employed the use of a 
practical coding system known as Morse code. You probably know that Morse code is a system of on-off 
keying developed for telegraph that is capable of passing intelligence over wire at an acceptable rate. 
Morse code consists only of periods of signal and no-signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-20 is the International Morse code used with telegraphy and cw modulation. Each character 
in the code is made up of a series of elements referred to as DOTS or DASHES. These are short (dot) and 
long (dash) bursts of signal separated by intervals of no signal. The dot is the basic time element of the 
code. The dash has three times the duration of a dot interval. The waveforms for both are shown in figure 
1-21. The elements within each character are separated by intervals of no signal with a time duration of 
one dot. The characters are separated by a no-signal interval equal in duration to one dash. Each interval </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Keying Methods 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Keying a transmitter causes an rf signal to be radiated only when the key contacts are closed. When 
the key contacts are open, the transmitter does not radiate energy. Keying is accomplished in either the 
oscillator or amplifier stage of a transmitter. A number of different keying systems are used in Navy 
transmitters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In most Navy transmitters, the hand telegraph key is at a low-voltage potential with respect to 
ground. A keying bar is usually grounded to protect the operator. Generally, a keying relay, with its 
contacts in the center-tap lead of the filament transformer, is used to key the equipment. Because one or 
more stages use the same filament transformer, these stages are also keyed. A class C final amplifier, 
when operated with fixed bias, is usually not keyed. This is because no output occurs when no excitation 
is applied in class C operation. Keying the final amplifier along with the other stages is not necessary in 
this case. 
</p><p class="paragraph">OSCILLATOR KEYING.—Two methods of OSCILLATOR KEYING are shown in figure 1-23. 
In view (A) the grid circuit is closed at all times. The key (K) opens and closes the negative side of the 
plate circuit. This system is called PLATE KEYING. When the key is open, no plate current can flow and 
the circuit does not oscillate. In view (B), the cathode circuit is open when the key is open and neither 
grid current nor plate current can flow. Both circuits are closed when the key is closed. This system is 
called CATHODE KEYING. Although the circuits of figure 1-23 may be used to key amplifiers, other 
keying methods are generally employed because of the high values of plate current and voltage 
encountered.

1-24. The key in view (A) shorts cathode resistor R1 allowing normal plate current to flow. With the key 
open, reduced plate current flows up through resistor R1 making the end connected to grid resistor Rg 
negative. If R1 has a high enough value, the bias developed is sufficient to cause cutoff of plate current. 
Depressing the key short-circuits R1. This increases the bias above cutoff and allows the normal flow of 
plate current. Grid resistor Rg is the usual grid-leak resistor for normal biasing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The blocked-grid keying method in view (B) affords a complete cutoff of plate current. It is one of 
the best methods for keying amplifier stages in transmitters. In the voltage divider with the key open, two-
thirds of 1,000 volts, or 667 volts, is developed across the 200-kilohm resistor; one-third of 1,000 volts, or 
333 volts, is developed across the 100-kilohm resistor. The grid bias is the sum of 100 volts and 333 
volts, or 433 volts. This sum is below cutoff and no plate current flows. The plate voltage is 667 volts. 
With the key closed, the 200-kilohm resistor drops 1,000 volts. The plate voltage becomes 1,000 volts at 
the same time the grid bias becomes 100 volts. Grid bias is reduced enough so that the triode amplifier 
will conduct only on the peaks of the drive signal. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

continuous operation; other transmitter circuits may be keyed. This procedure keeps the oscillator tube at 
a normal operating temperature and offers less chance for frequency variations to occur each time the key 
is closed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">KEYING RELAYS.—In transmitters using a crystal-controlled oscillator, the keying is almost 
always in a circuit stage following the oscillator. In large transmitters (75 watts or higher), the ordinary 
hand key cannot accommodate the plate current without excessive arcing. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WARNING-1-31-">WARNING

KEY IN THE PLATE CIRCUIT IS DANGEROUS. A SLIGHT SLIP OF THE HAND 
BELOW THE KEY KNOB COULD RESULT IN SEVERE SHOCK OR, IN THE 
CASE OF DEFECTIVE RF PLATE CHOKES, A SEVERE RF BURN. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In larger transmitters, some local low-voltage supply, such as a battery, is used with the hand key to 
open and close a circuit through the coils of a KEYING RELAY. The relay contacts open and close the 
keying circuit of the amplifier. A schematic diagram of a typical relay-operated keying system is shown 
in figure 1-25. The hand key closes the circuit from the low-voltage supply through the coil (L) of the 
keying relay. The relay armature closes the relay contacts as a result of the magnetic pull exerted on the 
armature. The armature moves against the tension of a spring. When the hand key is opened, the relay coil 
is deenergized and the spring opens the relay contacts.

</p><p class="paragraph">KEY CLICKS.—Ideally, cw keying a transmitter should instantly start and stop radiation of the 
carrier completely. However, the sudden application and removal of power causes rapid surges of current 
which may cause interference in nearby receivers. Even though such receivers are tuned to frequencies far 
removed from that of the transmitter, interference may be present in the form of "clicks" or "thumps." 
KEY-CLICK FILTERS are used in the keying systems of radio transmitters to prevent such interference. 
Two types of key-click filters are shown in figure 1-26. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the magnetic field of the inductor. The resistor controls the rate of charge of the capacitor and also 
prevents sparking at the key contacts by the sudden discharge of the capacitor when the key is closed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MACHINE KEYING.—The speed with which information can be transmitted using a hand key 
depends on the keying ability of the operator. Early communicators turned to mechanized methods of 
keying the transmitters to speed transmissions. More information could be passed in a given time by 
replacing the hand-operated key with a keying device capable of reading information from punched tape. 
Using this method, several operators could prepare tapes at their normal operating speed. The tapes could 
then be read through the keying device at a higher rate of speed and more information could be 
transmitted in a given amount of time.

Still, it has several advantages. Some of the advantages of cw transmission are a high degree of clarity 
under severe noise conditions, long-range operation, and narrow bandwidth. A highly skilled operator can 
pick out and read a cw signal even though it has a high degree of background noise or interference. Since 
only a single-carrier frequency is being transmitted, all of the transmitter power can be concentrated in the

</h3><p class="paragraph">A simple, single-tube cw transmitter can be made by coupling the output of an oscillator directly to 
an antenna (figure 1-28). The primary purpose of the oscillator is to develop an rf voltage which has a 
constant frequency and is immune to outside factors which may cause its frequency to shift. The output of 
this simple transmitter is controlled by placing a telegraph key at point K in series with the voltage 
supply. Since the plate supply is interrupted when the key is open, the circuit oscillates only as long as the 
key is closed. Although the transmitter shown uses a Colpitts oscillator, any of the oscillators previously 
described in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits can be 
used.

</p><p class="paragraph">Capacitors C2 and C3 can be GANGED (mechanically linked together) to simplify tuning. Capacitor 
C1 is used to tune (resonate) the antenna to the transmitter frequency. CA is the effective capacitance 
existing between the antenna and ground. This antenna-to-ground capacitance is in parallel with the 
tuning capacitors, C2 and C3. Since the antenna has capacitance, any change in its length or position, 
such as that caused by swaying of the antenna, changes the value of CA and causes the oscillator to 
change frequency. Because these frequency changes are undesirable for reliable communications, the 
multistage transmitter was developed to increase reliability. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Multistage Transmitters 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The simple, single-tube transmitter, shown in figure 1-28, is rarely used in practical equipment. Most 
of the transmitters you will see use a number of tubes or stages. The number used depends on the 
frequency, power, and application of the equipment. For your study, the following three categories of cw 
transmitters are discussed: (1) master oscillator power amplifier (mopa) transmitters, (2) multistage, 
high-power transmitters, (3) high- and very-high frequency transmitters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The mopa is both an oscillator and a power amplifier. Power-amplifying stages and frequency-
multiplying stages must be used to increase power and raise the frequency from those achievable in a 
mopa. The main difference between many low- and high-power transmitters is in the number of power-
amplifying stages that are used. Similarly, the main difference between many high- and very-high 
frequency transmitters is in the number of frequency-multiplying stages used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MASTER OSCILLATOR POWER AMPLIFIER.—For a transmitter to be stable, its oscillator 
must not be LOADED DOWN. This means that its antenna (which can present a varying impedance) 
must not be connected directly to the oscillator circuit. The rf oscillations must be sent through another 
circuit before they are fed to the antenna for good frequency stability to be obtained. That additional 
circuit is an rf power amplifier. Its purpose is to raise the amplitude of rf oscillations to the required 
output power level and isolate the oscillator from the antenna. Any transmitter consisting of an oscillator 
and a single-amplifier stage is called a master oscillator power amplifier transmitter (mopa), as shown in 
figure 1-29. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most mopa transmitters have only one tube amplifier in the power-amplifier stage. However, the 
oscillator may not produce sufficient power to drive a power-amplifier tube to the power output level 
required for the antenna. In such cases, the power-amplifier stages are designed to use two or more 
amplifiers which can be driven by the oscillator. Two or more amplifiers can be connected in parallel 
(with similar elements of each tube connected) or in a push-pull arrangement. In a push-pull amplifier, the 
grids are fed equal rf voltages that are 180 degrees out of phase. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The main advantage of a mopa transmitter is that the power-amplifier stage isolates the oscillator 
from the antenna. This prevents changes in antenna-to-ground capacitance from affecting the oscillator </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">frequency. A second advantage is that the rf power amplifier is operated so that a small change in the 
voltage applied to its grid circuit will produce a large change in the power developed in its plate circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Rf power amplifiers require that a specific amount of power be fed into the grid circuit. Only in this 
way can the tube deliver an amplified power output. However, the stable oscillator can produce only 
limited amounts of power. Therefore, the mopa transmitter is limited in the amount of power it can 
develop. This is one of the disadvantages of the mopa transmitter. Another disadvantage is that it often is 
impractical for use at very- and ultra-high frequencies. The reason is that the stability of self-excited 
oscillators decreases rapidly as the operating frequency increases. Circuit tuning capacitances are small at 
high frequencies and stray capacitances adversely affect frequency stability. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MULTISTAGE HIGH-POWER TRANSMITTERS.—The power amplifier of a high-power 
transmitter may require far more driving power than can be supplied by an oscillator. Therefore, one or 
more low-power intermediate amplifiers may be inserted between the oscillator and the final power 
amplifier to boost power to the antenna. In some types of equipment, a VOLTAGE AMPLIFIER, called a 
BUFFER is used between the oscillator and the first intermediate amplifier. The ideal buffer is operated 
class A and is biased negatively to prevent grid current flow during the excitation cycle. Therefore, it does 
not require driving power from, nor does it load down, the oscillator. The purpose of the buffer is to 
isolate the oscillator from the following stages and to minimize changes in oscillator frequency that occur 
with changes in loading. A buffer is required when keying takes place in an intermediate or final amplifier 
operating at comparatively high power. Look at the block diagrams of several medium-frequency 
transmitters in figure 1-30. The input and output powers are given for each stage. You should be able to 
see that the power output rating of a transmitter can be increased by adding amplifier tubes capable of 
delivering the power required.

comparatively low frequencies, sometimes as low as 1/100 of the output frequency. The oscillator 
frequency is raised to the required output frequency by passing it through one or more FREQUENCY 
MULTIPLIERS. Frequency multipliers are special rf power amplifiers which multiply the input 
frequency. In practice, the MULTIPLICATION FACTOR (number of times the input frequency is

being converted. The sensitivity is rated in dB and must be as high as possible. A high microphone output 
requires less gain in the amplifiers used with the microphone. This keeps the effects of thermal noise, 
amplifier hum, and noise pickup at a minimum. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For good quality sound reproduction, the electrical signal from the microphone must correspond in 
frequency content to the original sound waves. The microphone response should be uniform, or flat, 
within its frequency range and free from the electrical or mechanical generation of new frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The impedance of a microphone is important in that it must be matched to the microphone cable and 
to the amplifier input as well as to the amplifier input load. Exact impedance matching is not always 
possible, especially in the case where the impedance of the microphone increases with an increase in 
frequency. A long microphone cable tends to seriously attenuate the high frequencies if the microphone 
impedance is high. This attenuation is caused by the increased capacitive action of the line at higher 
frequencies. If the microphone has a low impedance, a lower voltage is developed in the microphone, and 
more voltage is available at the load. Because many microphone lines used aboard ship are long, low-
impedance microphones must be used to preserve a sufficiently high voltage level- over the required 
frequency range.

the current of the circuit. The varying current in the transformer primary produces an alternating voltage 
in the secondary. The transformer steps up the voltage and matches the low impedance of the microphone 
to the high impedance of the first amplifier. The voltage across the secondary may be as high as 25 volts 
peak. The impedance of this type of microphone varies from 50 to 200 ohms. This effect is caused by the 
pressure of compression and rarefaction of sound waves, discussed in chapter 1 of NEETS, Module 10,

button is positioned on each side of the diaphragm so that an increase in resistance on one side is 
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in resistance on the other. Each button is in series with the 
battery and one-half of the transformer primary. The decreasing current in one-half of the primary and the 
increasing current in the other half produces an output voltage in the secondary winding. The output 
voltage is proportional to the sum of the primary winding signal components. This action is similar to that 
of push-pull amplifiers.

which results from random changes in the resistance between individual carbon granules. Other 
disadvantages are reduced sensitivity and distortion that may result from the granules packing or sticking

requirement for an external voltage source.

largest voltage output for a given mechanical stress, it is the most commonly used crystal in microphones.

</p><p class="paragraph">A crystal microphone has a high impedance and does not require an external voltage source. It can 
be connected directly into the input circuit of a high-gain amplifier. However, because its output is low, 
several stages of high-gain amplification are required. Crystal microphones are delicate and must be 
handled with care. Exposure to temperatures above 52 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit) may 
permanently damage the crystal unit. Crystals are also soluble in water and other liquids and must be 
protected from moisture and excessive humidity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DYNAMIC MICROPHONE.—A cross section of the DYNAMIC or MOVING-COIL 
MICROPHONE is shown in figure 1-35. A coil of fine wire is mounted on the back of the diaphragm and 
located in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. When sound waves strike the diaphragm, the coil 
moves back and forth cutting the magnetic lines of force. This induces a voltage into the coil that is an 
electrical reproduction of the sound waves. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

lightweight and requires no external voltage. The dynamic microphone is rugged and can withstand the 
effects of vibration, temperature, and moisture. This microphone has a uniform response over a frequency 
range that extends from 40 to 15,000 hertz. The impedance is very low (generally 50 ohms or less). A 
transformer is required to match its impedance to that of the input of an af amplifier.

the diaphragm vibrates the armature at the same rate. This varies the magnetic flux in the armature and 
through the coil. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

compression wave strikes the diaphragm, the armature is deflected to the right. Most of the flux continues 
to move in the direction of the arrows. However, some flux now flows from the north pole of the magnet 
across the reduced gap at the upper right, down through the armature, and around to the south pole of the

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-AM-TRANSMITTER-PRINCIPLES-1-42-">AM TRANSMITTER PRINCIPLES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In this section we will describe the methods used to apply voice signals (intelligence) to a carrier 
wave by the process of amplitude modulation (AM). 
</p><p class="paragraph">An AM transmitter can be divided into two major sections according to the frequencies at which they 
operate, radio-frequency (rf) and audio-frequency (af) units. The rf unit is the section of the transmitter 
used to generate the rf carrier wave. As illustrated in figure 1-37, the carrier originates in the master 
oscillator stage where it is generated as a constant-amplitude, constant-frequency sine wave. The carrier is 
not of sufficient amplitude and must be amplified in one or more stages before it attains the high power 
required by the antenna. With the exception of the last stage, the amplifiers between the oscillator and the 
antenna are called INTERMEDIATE POWER AMPLIFIERS (ipa). The final stage, which connects to the 
antenna, is called the FINAL POWER AMPLIFIER (fpa). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The second section of the transmitter contains the audio circuitry. This section of the transmitter 
takes the small signal from the microphone and increases its amplitude to the amount necessary to fully 
modulate the carrier. The last audio stage is the MODULATOR. It applies its signal to the carrier in the 
final power amplifier. In this way, intelligence is included in the radiated rf waveform. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Modulated Wave 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The frequencies present in a signal can be conveniently represented by a graph of the frequency 
spectrum, shown in figure 1-38. In this graph, each individual frequency is portrayed as a vertical line. 
The position of the line along the horizontal axis indicates the frequency of the signal. The height of the 
frequency line is proportional to the amplitude of the signal. The rf spectrum in figure 1-38 shows the 
frequencies present when heterodyning occurs between frequencies of 5 and 100 kilohertz. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radiating energy at audio frequencies (discussed earlier in this chapter) is not practical. The 
heterodyning principle, however, makes possible the conversion of an af signal (intelligence) to an rf 
signal (with af intelligence) which can be radiated or transmitted through space. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Look again at figure 1-38. The sum and difference frequencies are located very near the rf signal 
(100 kilohertz), while the audio signal (5 kilohertz) is spaced a considerable distance away. Because of 
this frequency separation, the audio frequency can be easily removed by filter circuits, leaving just three 
radio frequencies of 95, 100, and 105 kilohertz. These three radio frequencies are radiated through space 
to the receiving station. At the receiver, the process is reversed. The frequency of 95 kilohertz, for 
example, is heterodyned with the frequency of 100 kilohertz and the sum and difference frequencies are 
again produced. (A similar process occurs between the frequencies of 100 and 105 kilohertz.) Of the 
resultant frequencies (95, 100, 105, and 5 kilohertz), all are filtered out except the 5 kilohertz difference 
frequency. This frequency, which is identical to the original 5 kilohertz audio applied at the transmitter, is 
retained and amplified. Thus, the 5 kilohertz audio tone appears  to have been radiated through space 
from the transmitter to the receiver. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the process just described, the 100 kilohertz frequency is referred to as the CARRIER 
FREQUENCY, and the sum and difference frequencies are referred to as SIDE FREQUENCIES. Since 
the sum frequency appears above the carrier frequency, it is referred to as the UPPER SIDE 
FREQUENCY. The difference frequency appears below the carrier and is referred to as the LOWER 
SIDE FREQUENCY. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When a carrier is modulated by voice or music signals, a large number of sum and difference 
frequencies are produced. All of the sum frequencies above the carrier are spoken of collectively as the 
UPPER SIDEBAND. All the difference frequencies below the carrier, also considered as a group, are 
called the LOWER SIDEBAND. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the carrier and the modulating signal are constant in amplitude, the sum and difference frequencies 
will also be constant in amplitude. However, when the carrier and sidebands are combined in a single 
impedance and viewed simultaneously with an oscilloscope, the resultant waveform appears as shown in 
figure 1-39. This resultant wave is called the MODULATION ENVELOPE. The modulation envelope 
has the same frequency as the carrier. However, it rises and falls in amplitude with the continual phase 
shift between the carrier and sidebands. This causes these signals to first aid and then oppose one another. 
These cyclic variations in the amplitude of the envelope have the same frequency as the audio-modulating </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

sideband frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">BANDWIDTH OF AN AM WAVE.—An ideal carrier wave contains a single frequency and 
occupies very little of the frequency spectrum. When the carrier is amplitude modulated, sideband 
frequencies are created both above and below the carrier frequency. This causes the signal to use up a 
greater portion of the frequency spectrum. The amount of space in the frequency spectrum required by the 
signal is called the BANDWIDTH of the signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The bandwidth of a modulated wave is a function of the frequencies contained in the modulating 
signal. For example, when a 100-kilohertz carrier is modulated by a 5-kilohertz audio tone, sideband 
frequencies are created at 95 and 105 kilohertz. This signal requires 10 kilohertz of space in the spectrum. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the same 100-kilohertz carrier is modulated by a 10-kilohertz audio tone, sideband frequencies will 
appear at 90 and 110 kilohertz and the signal will have a bandwidth of 20 kilohertz. Notice that as the 
modulating signal becomes higher in frequency, the bandwidth required also becomes greater. As 
illustrated by the above examples, the bandwidth of an amplitude-modulated wave at any instant is two 
times the highest modulating frequency applied at that time. Thus, if a 400-kilohertz carrier is modulated 
with 3, 5, and 8 kilohertz simultaneously, sideband frequencies will appear at 392, 395, 397, 403, 405, 
and 408 kilohertz. This signal extends from 392 to 408 kilohertz and has a bandwidth of 16 kilohertz, 
twice the highest modulating frequency of 8 kilohertz. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Musical instruments produce complex sound waves containing a great number of frequencies. The 
frequencies produced by a piano, for example, range from approximately 27 to 4,200 hertz with harmonic 
frequencies extending beyond 10 kilohertz. Modulating frequencies of up to 15 kilohertz must be 
included in the signal to transmit a musical passage with a high degree of fidelity. This requires a 
bandwidth of at least 30 kilohertz to prevent attenuation of higher-order harmonic frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the signal to be transmitted contains voice frequencies only, and fidelity is of minor importance, 
the bandwidth requirement is much smaller. A baritone voice includes frequencies of approximately 100 
to 350 hertz, or 250 hertz. Intelligible voice communications can be carried out as long as the 
communications system retains audio frequencies up to several thousand hertz. Comparing the conditions </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

required for voice communications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radio stations in the standard broadcast band are assigned carrier frequencies by the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC). When two stations are located near each other, their carriers must 
be spaced some minimum distance apart in the radio spectrum. Otherwise, the sideband frequencies of 
one station will interfere with sideband frequencies of the other station. The standard AM broadcast band 
starts at 535 kilohertz and ends at 1,605 kilohertz. Carrier assignments start at 540 kilohertz and continue 
in a succession of 10-kilohertz increments until the upper limit of the broadcast band is reached. This adds 
up to a total of 107 carrier assignments, or CHANNELS, over the entire broadcast band. If stations were 
assigned to all 107 channels (in a given geographical area), each station would be allotted a channel width 
of 10 kilohertz. This leaves 5 kilohertz on each side of each carrier for sidebands. Since interference 
between such closely spaced stations would be nearly impossible to prevent, the FCC avoids assigning 
adjacent channels to stations in the same area. As a consequence of this policy, one or more vacant 
channels normally exist between stations in the broadcast band. In the interest of better fidelity, the 
stations are permitted to use modulating frequencies higher than 5 kilohertz as long as no interference 
with other stations is produced.

principles of amplitude modulation can be obtained from a study of the properties of the modulation 
envelope. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A carrier wave which has been modulated by voice or music signals is accompanied by two 
sidebands; each sideband contains individual frequencies that vary continuously. Since a wave of this 
nature is nearly impossible to analyze, you can assume in the following sections that the modulating 
signal, unless otherwise qualified, is a single-frequency, constant-amplitude sine wave. 
</p><p class="paragraph">PERCENT OF MODULATION IN AN AM WAVE.—The degree of modulation is defined in 
terms of the maximum permissible amount of modulation. Thus, a fully modulated wave is said to be 
100-PERCENT MODULATED. The modulation envelope in figure 1-40, view (A), shows the conditions 
for 100-percent sine-wave modulation. For this degree of modulation, the peak audio voltage must be 
equal to the dc supply voltage to the final power amplifier. Under these conditions, the rf output voltage 
will reach 0 on the negative peak of the modulating signal; on the positive peak, it will rise to twice the 
amplitude of the unmodulated carrier. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When analyzed, the modulation envelope consists of the unmodulated rf carrier voltage plus the 
combined voltage of the two sidebands. The combined sideband voltages are approximately equal to the 
rf carrier voltage since each sideband frequency contains one-half the carrier voltage, as shown in view 
(B). This condition is known as 100-percent modulation and the maximum modulated rf voltage is twice 
the carrier voltage. The audio-modulating voltage can be increased beyond the amount required to 
produce 100-percent modulation. When this happens, the negative peak of the modulating signal becomes 
larger in amplitude than the dc plate-supply voltage to the final power amplifier. This causes the final 
plate voltage to be negative for a short period of time near the negative peak of the modulating signal. For 
the duration of the negative plate voltage, no rf energy is developed across the plate tank circuit and the rf 
output voltage remains at 0, as shown in figure 1-41, view (A).

</p><p class="paragraph">Look carefully at the modulation envelope in view (A). It shows that the negative peak of the 
modulating signal has effectively been limited. If the signal were demodulated (detected in the receiver), 
it would have an appearance somewhat similar to a square wave. This condition, known as 
OVERMODULATION, causes the signal to sound severely distorted (although this will depend on the 
degree of overmodulation). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Overmodulation will generate unwanted (SPURIOUS) sideband frequencies. This effect can easily 
be detected by tuning a receiver near, but somewhat outside the desired frequency. You would likely be 
able to tune to one or more of these undesired sideband frequencies, but the reception would be severely 
distorted, possibly unintelligible. (Without overmodulation, no such unwanted sideband frequencies 
would exist and you would be able to tune only to the desired frequency.) These unwanted frequencies 
will appear for a considerable range both above and below the desired channel. This effect is sometimes 
called SPLATTER. These spurious frequencies, shown in view (B), cause interference with other stations 
operating on adjacent channels. You should clearly understand that overmodulation, and its attendant 
distortion and interference is to be avoided.

</p><p class="paragraph">Ideally, you will want to operate a transmitter at 100-percent modulation so that you can provide the 
maximum amount of energy in the sideband. However, because of the large and rapid fluctuations in 
amplitude that these signals normally contain, this ideal condition is seldom possible. When the 
modulator is properly adjusted, the loudest parts of the transmission will produce 100-percent modulation. 
The quieter parts of the signal then produce lesser degrees of modulation.

pattern on the screen of an oscilloscope. For example, assume that your oscilloscope is connected to the 
output of a modulator circuit and produces the screen pattern shown in figure 1-42. According to the 
setting of the calibration control, each large division on the vertical scale is equal to 200 volts. By using

</p><p class="paragraph">During the first 1/8 of a second (T1 to T2), the carrier wave completes exactly 1 cycle, or 360 
degrees, as shown in view (C). The upper sideband, which has a frequency of 9 hertz, will complete each 
cycle in less than 1/8 of a second. Therefore, during the time required for the carrier to complete 1 cycle 
of 360 degrees, the upper sideband [view (B)] is able to complete 1 cycle of 360 degrees plus an 
additional 45 degrees of the next cycle, for a total of 405 degrees. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The lower sideband [view (D)] has a frequency of 7 hertz and cannot complete an entire cycle in 1/8 
of a second. During the time interval required for the carrier wave to progress through 360 degrees, the 
lower sideband frequency of 7 hertz can complete only 315 degrees, 45 degrees short of a full cycle. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Keeping these factors in mind, you should be able to see that the phase angles between the two 
sideband frequencies, and between each sideband frequency and the carrier frequency, will continually 
shift. At an instant in time (T3), the carrier and sidebands will be in phase [view (E)], causing the 
envelope amplitude [view (F)] to be twice the amplitude of the carrier. At another instant in time (T7), the 
sidebands are out of phase with the carrier [view (E)], causing complete cancellation of the rf voltage. 
The envelope amplitude will become 0 at this point. You should see that, although the carrier and 
sideband frequencies have constant amplitudes, the ever-changing phase differences between them causes 
the modulation envelope to vary continuously in amplitude. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The vector analysis of the modulation envelope will be developed with the aid of figure 1-44. In 
figure 1-44, view (A), a vertical vector (C) has been drawn to represent the carrier wave in figure 1-43. At 
T1 in figure 1-43, the upper and lower sideband frequencies are of opposite phase with respect to each 
other, and 90 degrees out of phase with respect to the carrier. This condition is illustrated in figure 1-44, 
view (A), by sideband vectors U and L drawn in opposite directions along the horizontal axis. Since the 
upper sideband U is equal in amplitude but opposite in phase to lower sideband L, the two sideband 
voltages cancel one another; the amplitude of the envelope at T1 is equal to the amplitude of the carrier. 
The same vector diagram is shown on a smaller scale in figure 1-43, view (E).

original position, as shown in figure 1-44, view (B). The upper sideband frequency, however, will

carrier or the upper sideband. In 1/8 of a second, vector L completes only 315 degrees, which is 45 
degrees short of one complete rotation. At the end of 1/8 of a second, the three vectors have advanced to 
the positions shown in view (B). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The resultant vector in view (B) is obtained by adding vector U to vector L. Since each sideband has 
one-half the amplitude of the carrier, and the two sidebands differ in phase by 90 degrees, the amplitude 
of the resultant vector can be computed. This computation (not shown) would show the resultant vector to 
have an amplitude that is approximately 70 percent that of the carrier. Thus, at T2 the amplitude of the 
modulation envelope is about 1.7 times the amplitude of the carrier. This condition is shown in figure 
1-43, view (F). 
</p><p class="paragraph">By a similar procedure, vector diagrams can be constructed for time intervals T3 through T9. This 
has been done in figure 1-43, view (E). From these nine individual vector diagrams, the complete 
modulation envelope in figure 1-43, view (F), can be constructed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice in particular the vector diagrams for T3 and T7. At T3, all three waves, and therefore all three 
vectors, are in phase. The modulation envelope at this instant must, therefore, be equal to twice the 
amplitude of the carrier since each sideband frequency has one-half the amplitude of the carrier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At T7, the two sideband frequencies are in phase with each other but 180 degrees out of phase with 
the carrier. This causes the combined sideband voltage to cancel the carrier voltage, and the modulation 
envelope becomes 0 at that instant. Note that for the transmitter output to be 0 at T7, both the carrier and 
sideband frequencies must be present. If any one of these three frequencies were missing, complete 
cancellation would not occur and rf energy would be present in the output. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Although this vector analysis was made for frequencies of 7, 8, and 9 hertz, the same description 
could be applied to the frequencies actually present at the output of a transmitter.

proper operation. The modulator is coupled to the plate circuit of the final rf amplifier through the 
modulation transformer. For 100-percent modulation, the modulator must supply enough power to cause 
the plate voltage of the final rf amplifier to vary between 0 and twice the dc operating plate voltage. The 
modulator tube (V2) is a power amplifier biased so that it operates class A. The final rf power amplifier 
(V1) is biased in the nonlinear portion of its operating range (class C). This provides for efficient 
operation of V1 and produces the necessary heterodyning action between the rf carrier and the af 
modulating frequencies. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

view (C). The plate tank output circuit (T3) is shocked into oscillation by these current pulses and the rf 
output waveform shown in view (E) is developed. The rf plate voltage waveform is shown in view (D). 
</p><p class="paragraph">An audio-modulating voltage applied to the grid of V2 is amplified by the modulator and coupled to 
the plate of V1 by modulation transformer T2. The secondary of T2 is in series with the plate-supply 
voltage (E) of V1. The modulating voltage will either add to or subtract from the plate voltage of V1. This 
is shown in view (A) at time 2 and time 3. At time 2 in view (A), the plate supply voltage for V1 
increases to twice its normal value and the rf plate current pulses double, as shown in view (C). At time 3 
in view (A), the supply voltage is reduced to 0 and the rf plate current decreases to 0, as shown in view 
(C). These changes in rf plate current cause rf tank T3 voltage to double at time 2 and to decrease to 0 at 
time 3, as shown in view (E). This action results in the modulation envelope shown in view (E) that 
represents 100-percent modulation. This is transformer-coupled out of tank circuit T3 to an antenna. 
Because of the oscillating action of tank circuit T3, V1 has to be rated to handle at least four times its 
normal plate supply voltage (Eb), as shown by the plate voltage waveform in view (D). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Heterodyning the audio frequency intelligence from the modulator (V2) with the carrier in the plate 
circuit of the final power amplifier (V1) requires a large amount of audio power. All of the power or 
voltage that contains the intelligence must come from the modulator stage. This is why plate modulation 
is called high-level modulation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The heterodyning action in the plate modulator effectively changes an audio frequency to a different 
part of the frequency spectrum. This action allows antennas and equipment of practical sizes to be used to 
transmit the intelligence. Now, let's look at several other typical modulators. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Collector-Injection Modulator

plate modulator. This transistor modulator can be used for low-level or relatively high-level modulation. 
It is referred to as relatively high-level modulation because, at the present time, transistors are limited in 
their power-handling capability. As illustrated in figure 1-47, the circuit design for a transistor collector-
injection modulator is very similar to that of a plate modulator. The collector-injection modulator is

</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 1-47, the rf carrier is applied to the base of modulator Q1. The modulating signal is applied 
to the collector in series with the collector supply voltage through T3. The output is then taken from the 
secondary of T2. With no modulating signal, Q1 acts as an rf amplifier for the carrier frequency. When 
the modulation signal is applied, it adds to or subtracts from the collector supply voltage. This causes the 
rf current pulses of the collector to vary in amplitude with the collector supply voltage. These collector 
current pulses cause oscillations in the tank circuit (C4 and the primary of T2). The tank circuit is tuned to 
the carrier frequency. During periods when the collector current is high, the tank circuit oscillates 
strongly. At times when the collector current is small, or entirely absent, little or no energy is supplied to 
the tank and oscillations become weak or die out. Thus, the modulation envelope is developed as it was in 
a plate modulator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As transistor technology continues to develop, higher power applications of transistor collector-
injection modulation will be employed. Plate and collector-injection modulation are the most commonly 
used types of modulation because the modulating signal can be applied in the final stages of rf 
amplification. This allows the majority of the rf amplifier stages to be operated class C for maximum 
efficiency. The plate and collector-injection modulators also require large amounts of af modulating

modulation is necessary. The CONTROL-GRID MODULATOR is used widely in portable and mobile 
equipment to reduce size and power requirements. It is also used in extremely high-power, wideband 
equipment such as television transmitters where high-level or plate modulation is difficult and costly to 
achieve. Figure 1-48 is a basic schematic for a typical control-grid modulator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

</p><p class="paragraph">The control-grid modulator uses a variation of grid bias (at the frequency of the modulating signal) 
to vary the instantaneous plate voltage and current. These variations cause modulation of the carrier 
frequency. The carrier frequency is introduced through coupling capacitor Cc. The modulating frequency 
is introduced in series with the grid bias through T1. As the modulating signal increases and decreases 
(positive and negative), it will add to or subtract from the bias on rf amplifier V1. This change in bias 
causes a corresponding change in plate voltage and current. These changes in plate voltage and current 
add vectorially to the carrier frequency and provide a modulation envelope in the same fashion as does 
the plate modulator. Since changes in the plate circuit of the rf amplifier are controlled by changes in the 
grid bias, the gain of the tube requires only a low-level modulating signal. Even when the input signals 
are at these low levels, occasional modulation voltage peaks will occur that will cause V1 to saturate. This 
creates distortion in the output. Care must be taken to bias the rf amplifier tube for maximum power out </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

is necessary during nonmodulated periods to provide the tube with the power to develop the sidebands. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Compared to plate modulation, grid modulation is less efficient, produces more distortion, and

signal is injected through C1, it develops a voltage across R1 that adds to or subtracts from the bias on 
Q1. This change in bias changes the gain of Q1, causing more or less energy to be supplied to the 
collector tank circuit. The tank circuit develops the modulation envelope as the rf frequency and af 
modulating frequency are mixed in the collector circuit. Again, this action is identical to that in the plate 
modulator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

modulator is well suited for use in small, portable equipment, such as "walkie-talkies," and test

series with the grid and plate circuits, you should be able see that changing the cathode voltage will 
effectively change the voltage of the other tube elements. By properly controlling the voltages on the 
tube, you can cause the cathode modulator to operate in a form of plate modulation with high efficiency. 
Usually, the cathode modulator is designed to perform about midway between plate and grid modulator 
levels, using the advantages of each type. When operated between the two levels, the modulator provides 
a more linear output with moderate efficiency and a modest audio power requirement. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 1-50, the rf carrier is applied to the grid of V1 and the modulating signal is applied in series 
with the cathode through T1. Since the modulating signal is effectively in series with the grid and plate 
voltage, the level of modulating voltage required will be determined by the relationships of the three 
voltages. The modulation takes place in the plate circuit with the plate tank developing the modulation 
envelope, just as it did in the plate modulator.

</p><p class="paragraph">extremely low-level modulator that is useful in portable equipment. In emitter-injection modulation, the 
gain of the rf amplifier is varied by the changing voltage on the emitter. The changing voltage is caused 
by the injection of the modulating signal into the emitter circuitry of Q1, as shown in figure 1-51. Here 
the modulating voltage adds to or subtracts from transistor biasing. The change in bias causes a change in 
collector current and results in a heterodyning action. The modulation envelope is developed across the 
collector-tank circuit.

</p><p class="paragraph">You have studied six methods of amplitude modulation. These are not the only methods available, 
but they are the most common. All methods of AM modulation use the same theory of heterodyning 
across a nonlinear device. AM modulation is one of the easiest and least expensive types of modulation to 
achieve. The primary disadvantages of AM modulation are susceptibility to noise interference and the 
inefficiency of the transmitter. Power is wasted in the transmission of the carrier frequency because it 
contains no AM intelligence. In the next chapter, you will study other forms of modulation that have been 
developed to overcome these disadvantages.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ANGLE-MODULATION-2-2-">ANGLE MODULATION
</h2><p class="paragraph">ANGLE MODULATION is modulation in which the angle of a sine-wave carrier is varied by a
modulating wave. FREQUENCY MODULATION (fm) and PHASE MODULATION (pm) are two types
of angle modulation. In frequency modulation the modulating signal causes the carrier frequency to vary.
These variations are controlled by both the frequency and the amplitude of the modulating wave. In phase
modulation the phase of the carrier is controlled by the modulating waveform. Let’s study these
modulation methods for an understanding of their similarities and differences.
</p><h3 class="subsection">FREQUENCY-MODULATION SYSTEMS
In frequency modulation an audio signal is used to shift the frequency of an oscillator at an audio
</h3><p class="paragraph">rate. The simplest form of this is seen in FREQUENCY-SHIFT KEYING (fsk). Frequency-shift keying is
somewhat similar to continuous-wave keying (cw) in AM transmissions.
Frequency-Shift Keying
</p><p class="paragraph">Consider figure 2-1, views (A) through (D). View (A) is a radio frequency (rf) carrier which is
actually several thousand or million hertz. View (B) represents the intelligence to be transmitted as
MARKS and SPACES. Recall that in cw transmission, this intelligence was applied to the rf carrier by
interrupting the signal, as shown in view (C). The amplitude of the rf alternated between maximum and 0
volts. By comparing views (B) and (C), you can see the mark/space intelligence of the Morse code
character on the rf. The spacing of the waveform in view (D) is an example of the same intelligence as it
is applied to the frequency instead of the amplitude of the rf. This is simple frequency-shift keying of the
same Morse code character.

key. This is shown in view (D). For illustrative purposes, the spacing frequency in view (D) is shown as
double the marking frequency. However, in practice the difference is usually less than 1,000 hertz, even
when operating at several megahertz. You should also note that the limit of frequency shift is determined
without reference to the amplitude of the keying signal in the fsk system. The frequency shift may be set
at plus or minus 425 hertz from the allocated channel frequency. The total shift between mark and space
would be 850 hertz. Either the mark or space may use the higher of the two frequencies. The upper
frequency of the transmitted signal is usually the spacing interval and the lower frequency is the marking
interval.

the frequency axis in view (A) of figure 2-2. The complete intelligence is carried as variations in the
amplitude of the signal. To receive the intelligence carried by such a signal, the receiving equipment must
be able to scan the signal along the time and amplitude axes, which carry the information. When scanned
along the time and amplitude axes [shown in view (B)], the intelligence appears as large changes in
amplitude. If the circuit were perfect, these variations would be from 0 amplitude to some maximum

</p><p class="paragraph">electrical machinery appear as additional variations along the amplitude axis. When these amplitude
variations approach or exceed the variation caused by the keyed intelligence, the signal is blanked out by
interference. We have all heard this happen on our AM radios during storms or when near operating
machinery.
</p><p class="paragraph">View (C) of figure 2-2 represents the same signal when scanned along the time and frequency axes
as it would be in an fm receiver. Variations in signal amplitude have no effect on the frequency and no
intelligence can be received. Note that the noise and interference components have also been suppressed
so that they have little effect on the received signal. Thus, if the intelligence variations were impressed as
changes along the frequency axis, and the receiving equipment were designed to respond to this type of
signal, then the effects of noise and interference would be practically eliminated. Frequency-shift keyed
circuits fulfill these conditions.
</p><p class="paragraph">FSK SIGNALS.—In fsk the rf signal is shifted in frequency (not amplitude) between "key-open"
and "key-closed" conditions. The signal amplitude remains essentially constant. View (A) of figure 2-3
represents the letter "F" keyed as a shift in frequency between mark and space. The normal frequency
condition with the key open is a space. Recall that this may be either the lower or higher frequency. When
the key is closed, the frequency instantly changes to the mark value and remains constant during the
marking interval. Opening the key again returns the frequency to the space frequency. Midway between
the mark and space frequencies is the assigned channel frequency.
</p><p class="paragraph">Also shown in view (A) is the variation along the amplitude axis caused by the same noise and
interference mentioned earlier. The right-hand portion of view (A) illustrates the elimination of this noise
by the receiving equipment. View (B) clearly shows that scanning the signal along the amplitude and time
axes reproduces no amplitude variations from signal interference. However, if the scanning is
accomplished along the frequency and time axes, the intelligence is reproduced, as shown in view (C). By
this system, the intelligence can be recovered at the receiving station in its original form; it will be nearly
unaffected by conditions in the radio path other than fading. As a matter of fact, fsk resists the effects of
fading better than cw.
</p><p class="paragraph">FREQUENCY-SHIFT KEYING.—In its simplest form, frequency-shift keying of a transmitter
can be accomplished by shunting a capacitor (or an inductor) and key (in series) across the oscillator
circuit. By locking the normal key of the transmitter and operating only the oscillator circuit key, you can
change the oscillator frequency. The shift in frequency between mark (key-closed) and space (key-open)
conditions is determined by the effect of the additional capacitance (or inductance) on the oscillator
frequency. The frequency multiplication factor in the transmitter amplifiers must be taken into
consideration when determining the oscillator frequency shift. Thus, if the desired shift is the
conventional 850 hertz at the transmission frequency, and this frequency is four times the oscillator
frequency (that is, doubled in two stages), then the effect of the additional capacitance (or inductance) on
the oscillator must be limited to 212.5 hertz as shown below:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Frequency-shift keyers are, of course, more complicated than this simple illustration would seem to
show, but the basic principles are the same. Still, the keyer does change the oscillator frequency by a
certain number of cycles. Further, this change must be correlated with the multiplication factor of the
transmitter to cause the desired shift between mark and space frequencies.
</p><p class="paragraph">METHODS OF FREQUENCY SHIFTING.—Frequency-shift keyers operate on either of two
general principles. First, the keyer may take the output of the transmitter's master oscillator and modulate
it with the output of another oscillator that is frequency-shift keyed. This action will result in two
frequencies that are used to excite the first amplifier stage of the transmitter. This system is illustrated in
view (A) of figure 2-4. View (B) illustrates the second method of frequency-shift keyer operation. In this
method the transmitter's master oscillator is itself shifted in frequency by the mark and space impulses
from the keyer unit.

</p><p class="paragraph">ADVANTAGES OF FSK OVER AM.—Frequency-shift keying is used in all single-channel,
radiotelegraph systems that use automatic printing systems. The advantage of fsk over on-off keyed cw is
that it rejects unwanted signals (noise) that are weaker than the desired signal. This is true of all fm
systems. Also, since a signal is always present in the fsk receiver, automatic volume control methods may
be used to minimize the effects of signal fading caused by ionospheric variations. The amount of inherent
signal-to-noise ratio improvement of fsk over AM is approximately 3 to 4 dB. This improvement is
because the signal energy of fsk is always present while signal energy is present for only one-half the time
in AM systems. Noise is continuously present in both fsk and AM, but is eliminated in fsk reception.
Under the rapid fading and high-noise conditions that commonly exist in the high frequency (hf) region,
fsk shows a marked advantage over AM. Overall improvement is sometimes expressed as the RATIO OF
TRANSMITTED POWERS required to give equivalent transmission results over the two systems. Such a
ratio varies widely, depending on the prevailing conditions. With little fading, the ratio may be entirely
the result of the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and may be under 5 dB. However, under severe
fading conditions, large amounts of power often fail to give good results for AM transmission. At the
same time, fsk may be satisfactory at nominal power. The power ratio (fsk versus AM) would become
infinite in such a case.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another application of fsk is at low and very low frequencies (below 300 kilohertz). At these
frequencies, keying speeds are limited by the "flywheel" effect of the extremely large capacitance and
inductance of the antenna circuits. These circuits tend to oscillate at their resonant frequencies.
Frequency-shifting the transmitter and changing the antenna resonance by the same keying impulses will
result in much greater keying speeds. As a result, the use of these expensive channels is much more
efficient.

controlled by the frequency of the modulating signal. The amount by which the frequency departs from
the average is controlled by the amplitude of the modulating signal. This variation is referred to as the
FREQUENCY DEVIATION of the frequency-modulated wave. We can now establish two clear-cut rules
for frequency deviation rate and amplitude in frequency modulation:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• AMOUNT OF FREQUENCY SHIFT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE AMPLITUDE OF THE
MODULATING SIGNAL
</h3><p class="paragraph">(This rule simply means that if a 10-volt signal causes a frequency shift of 20 kilohertz, then a

</p><h3 class="subsection">• RATE OF FREQUENCY SHIFT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FREQUENCY OF THE

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-6 illustrates a simple oscillator circuit with the addition of a condenser microphone (M) in
shunt with the oscillator tank circuit. Although the condenser microphone capacitance is actually very
low, the capacitance of this microphone will be considered near that of the tuning capacitor (C). The
frequency of oscillation in this circuit is, of course, determined by the LC product of all elements of the
circuit; but, the product of the inductance (L) and the combined capacitance of C and M are the primary
frequency components. When no sound waves strike M, the frequency is the rf carrier frequency. Any
excitation of M will alter its capacitance and, therefore, the frequency of the oscillator circuit. Figure 2-7
illustrates what happens to the capacitance of the microphone during excitation. In view (A), the audio-
frequency wave has three levels of intensity, shown as X, a whisper; Y, a normal voice; and Z, a loud
voice. In view (B), the same conditions of intensity are repeated, but this time at a frequency twice that of
view (A). Note in each case that the capacitance changes both positively and negatively; thus the
frequency of oscillation alternates both above and below the resting frequency. The amount of change is
determined by the change in capacitance of the microphone. The change is caused by the amplitude of the
sound wave exciting the microphone. The rate at which the change in frequency occurs is determined by</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

frequency of the sound wave. For example, suppose a 1,000-hertz tone of a certain loudness strikes the
microphone. The frequency of the carrier will then shift by a certain amount, say plus and minus 40
kilohertz. The carrier will be shifted 1,000 times per second. Now assume that with its loudness
unchanged, the frequency of the tone is changed to 4,000 hertz. The carrier frequency will still shift plus
and minus 40 kilohertz; but now it will shift at a rate of 4,000 times per second. Likewise, assume that at
the same loudness, the tone is reduced to 200 hertz. The carrier will continue to shift plus and minus 40
kilohertz, but now at a rate of 200 times per second. If the loudness of any of these modulating tones is
reduced by one-half, the frequency of the carrier will be shifted plus and minus 20 kilohertz. The carrier
will then shift at the same rate as before. This fulfills all requirements for frequency modulation. Both the
frequency and the amplitude of the modulating signal are translated into variations in the frequency of the
rf carrier.

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-8 shows how the frequency shift of an fm signal goes through the same variations as does
the modulating signal. In this figure the dimension of the constant amplitude is omitted. (As these
remaining waveforms are presented, be sure you take plenty of time to study and digest what the figures
tell you. Look each one over carefully, noting everything you can about them. Doing this will help you
understand this material.) If the maximum frequency deviation is set at 75 kilohertz above and below the
carrier, the audio amplitude of the modulating wave must be so adjusted that its peaks drive the frequency
only between these limits. This can then be referred to as 100-PERCENT MODULATION, although the
term is only remotely applicable to fm. Projections along the vertical axis represent deviations in
frequency from the resting frequency (carrier) in terms of audio amplitude. Projections along the
horizontal axis represent time. The distance between A and B represents 0.001 second. This means that
carrier deviations from the resting frequency to plus 75 kilohertz, then to minus 75 kilohertz, and finally
back to rest would occur 1,000 times per second. This would equate to an audio frequency of 1,000 hertz.
Since the carrier deviation for this period (A to B) extends to the full allowable limits of plus and minus
75 kilohertz, the wave is fully modulated. The distance from C to D is the same as that from A to B, so
the time interval and frequency are the same as before. Notice, however, that the amplitude of the
modulating wave has been decreased so that the carrier is driven to only plus and minus 37.5 kilohertz,
one-half the allowable deviation. This would correspond to only 50-percent modulation if the system
were AM instead of fm. Between E and F, the interval is reduced to 0.0005 second. This indicates an
increase in frequency of the modulating signal to 2,000 hertz. The amplitude has returned to its maximum
allowable value, as indicated by the deviation of the carrier to plus and minus 75 kilohertz. Interval G to
H represents the same frequency at a lower modulation amplitude (66 percent). Notice the GUARD
BANDS between plus and minus 75 kilohertz and plus and minus 100 kilohertz. These bands isolate the
modulation extremes of this particular channel from that of adjacent channels.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">PERCENT OF MODULATION.—Before we explain 100-percent modulation in an fm system,
let's review the conditions for 100-percent modulation of an AM wave. Recall that 100-percent
modulation for AM exists when the amplitude of the modulation envelope varies between 0 volts and
twice its normal unmodulated value. At 100-percent modulation there is a power increase of 50 percent.
Because the modulating wave is not constant in voice signals, the degree of modulation constantly varies.
In this case the vacuum tubes in an AM system cannot be operated at maximum efficiency because of
varying power requirements.
</p><p class="paragraph">In frequency modulation, 100-percent modulation has a meaning different from that of AM. The
modulating signal varies only the frequency of the carrier. Therefore, tubes do not have varying power
requirements and can be operated at maximum efficiency and the fm signal has a constant power output.
In fm a modulation of 100 percent simply means that the carrier is deviated in frequency by the full
permissible amount. For example, an 88.5-megahertz fm station operates at 100-percent modulation when
the modulating signal deviation frequency band is from 75 kilohertz above to 75 kilohertz below the
carrier (the maximum allowable limits). This maximum deviation frequency is set arbitrarily and will
vary according to the applications of a given fm transmitter. In the case given above, 50-percent
modulation would mean that the carrier was deviated 37.5 kilohertz above and below the resting
frequency (50 percent of the 150-kilohertz band divided by 2). Other assignments for fm service may
limit the allowable deviation to 50 kilohertz, or even 10 kilohertz. Since there is no fixed value for
comparison, the term "percent of modulation" has little meaning for fm. The term MODULATION
INDEX is more useful in fm modulation discussions. Modulation index is frequency deviation divided by
the frequency of the modulating signal.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

carrier frequency. Actually, an infinite number of sidebands are produced, but only a small portion of
them are of sufficient amplitude to be important. For example, for a modulation index of 0.5 [top
spectrums of both views (A) and (B)], the number of significant sidebands counted is 4. For the next
spectrums down, the modulation index is 1.0 and the number of sidebands is 6, and so forth. This holds
true for any combination of deviating and modulating frequencies that yield identical modulating indexes.

</p><p class="paragraph">METHODS OF FREQUENCY MODULATION.—The circuit shown earlier in figure 2-6 and the
discussion in previous paragraphs were for illustrative purposes only. In reality, such a circuit would not
be practical. However, the basic principle involved (the change in reactance of an oscillator circuit in
accordance with the modulating voltage) constitutes one of the methods of developing a frequency-
modulated wave.
</p><p class="paragraph">Reactance-Tube Modulation.—In direct modulation, an oscillator is frequency modulated by a
REACTANCE TUBE that is in parallel (SHUNT) with the oscillator tank circuit. (The terms "shunt" or
"shunting" will be used in this module to mean the same as "parallel" or "to place in parallel with"
components.) This is illustrated in figure 2-11. The oscillator is a conventional Hartley circuit with the
reactance-tube circuit in parallel with the tank circuit of the oscillator tube. The reactance tube is an
ordinary pentode. It is made to act either capacitively or inductively; that is, its grid is excited with a
voltage which either leads or lags the oscillator voltage by 90 degrees.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the reactance tube is connected across the tank circuit with no modulating voltage applied, it
will affect the frequency of the oscillator. The voltage across the oscillator tank circuit (L1 and C1) is also
in parallel with the series network of R1 and C7. This voltage causes a current flow through R1 and C7. If
R1 is at least five times larger than the capacitive reactance of C7, this branch of the circuit will be
essentially resistive. Voltage E
</p><p class="paragraph"> 1, which is across C7, will lag current by 90 degrees. E 1 is applied to the
control grid of reactance tube V1. This changes plate current (Ip), which essentially flows only through
the LC tank circuit. This is because the value of R1 is high compared to the impedance of the tank circuit.
Since current is inversely proportional to impedance, most of the plate current coupled through C3 flows
through the tank circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">At resonance, the voltage and current in the tank circuit are in phase. Because E1 lags E by 90
degrees and I
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">is in phase with grid voltage E1, the superimposed current through the tank circuit lags the
original tank current by 90 degrees. Both the resultant current (caused by Ip) and the tank current lag tank
voltage and current by some angle depending on the relative amplitudes of the two currents. Because this
resultant current is a lagging current, the impedance across the tank circuit cannot be at its maximum
unless something happens within the tank to bring current and voltage into phase. Therefore, this situation
continues until the frequency of oscillations in the tank circuit changes sufficiently so that the voltages
across the tank and the current flowing into it are again in phase. This action is the same as would be
produced by adding a reactance in parallel with the L1C1 tank. Because the superimposed current lags
voltage E by 90 degrees, the introduced reactance is inductive. In NEETS, Module 2, Introduction to</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Alternating Current and Transformers, you learned that total inductance decreases as additional inductors
are added in parallel. Because this introduced reactance effectively reduces inductance, the frequency of
the oscillator increases to a new fixed value.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now let’s see what happens when a modulating signal is applied. The magnitude of the introduced
reactance is determined by the magnitude of the superimposed current through the tank. The magnitude of
Ip for a given E1 is determined by the transconductance of V1. (Transconductance was covered in NEETS,
Module 6, Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies.) Therefore, the value of
reactance introduced into the tuned circuit varies directly with the transconductance of the reactance tube.
When a modulating signal is applied to the grid of V1, both E1 and I change, causing transconductance to
vary with the modulating signal. This causes a variable reactance to be introduced into the tuned circuit.
This variable reactance either adds to or subtracts from the fixed value of reactance that is introduced in
the absence of the modulating signal. This action varies the reactance across the oscillator which, in turn,
varies the instantaneous frequency of the oscillator. These variations in the oscillator frequency are
proportional to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating voltage. Reactance-tube modulators are
usually operated at low power levels. The required output power is developed in power amplifier stages
that follow the modulators.
</p><p class="paragraph">The output of a reactance-tube modulated oscillator also contains some unwanted amplitude
modulation. This unwanted modulation is caused by stray capacitance and the resistive component of the
RC phase splitter. The resistance is much less significant than the desired XC, but the resistance does
allow some plate current to flow which is not of the proper phase relationship for good tube operation.
The small amplitude modulation that this produces is easily removed by passing the oscillator output
through a limiter-amplifier circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor Reactance Modulator.—The SEMICONDUCTOR-REACTANCE MODULATOR
is used to frequency modulate low-power semiconductor transmitters. Figure 2-12 shows a typical
frequency-modulated oscillator stage operated as a reactance modulator. Q1, along with its associated
circuitry, is the oscillator. Q2 is the modulator and is connected to the circuit so that its collector-to-
emitter capacitance (CCE) is in parallel with a portion of the rf oscillator coil, L1. As the modulator
operates, the output capacitance of Q2 is varied. Thus, the frequency of the oscillator is shifted in
accordance with the modulation the same as if C1 were varied.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When the modulating signal is applied to the base of Q2, the emitter-to-base bias varies at the
modulation rate. This causes the collector voltage of Q2 to vary at the same modulating rate. When the
collector voltage increases, output capacitance CCE decreases; when the collector voltage decreases, CCE
increases. An increase in collector voltage has the effect of spreading the plates of CCE farther apart by
increasing the width of the barrier. A decrease of collector voltage reduces the width of the pn junction
and has the same effect as pushing the capacitor plates together to provide more capacitance.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the output capacitance decreases, the instantaneous frequency of the oscillator tank circuit
increases (acts the same as if C1 were decreased). When the output capacitance increases, the
instantaneous frequency of the oscillator tank circuit decreases. This decrease in frequency produces a
lower frequency in the output because of the shunting effect of CCE. Thus, the frequency of the oscillator
tank circuit increases and decreases at an audio frequency (af) modulating rate. The output of the
oscillator, therefore, is a frequency modulated rf signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the audio modulation causes the collector voltage to increase and decrease, an AM component
is induced into the output. This produces both an fm and AM output. The amplitude variations are then
removed by placing a limiter stage after the reactance modulator and only the frequency modulation
remains.
</p><p class="paragraph">Frequency multipliers or mixers (discussed in chapter 1) are used to increase the oscillator frequency
to the desired output frequency. For high-power applications, linear rf amplifiers are used to increase the
steady-amplitude signal to a higher power output. With the initial modulation occurring at low levels, fm
represents a savings of power when compared to conventional AM. This is because fm noise-reducing
properties provide a better signal-to-noise ratio than is possible with AM.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Multivibrator Modulator.—Another type of frequency modulator is the astable multivibrator
illustrated in figure 2-13. Inserting the modulating af voltage in series with the base-return of the
multivibrator transistors causes the gate length, and thus the fundamental frequency of the multivibrator,
to vary. The amount of variation will be in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating voltage. One
requirement of this method is that the fundamental frequency of the multivibrator be high in relation to
the highest modulating frequencies. A factor of at least 100 provides the best results.
</p><p class="paragraph">Recall that a multivibrator output consists of the fundamental frequency and all of its harmonics.
Unwanted even harmonics are eliminated by using a SYMMETRICAL MULTIVIBRATOR circuit, as
shown in figure 2-13. The desired fundamental frequency, or desired odd harmonics, can be amplified
after all other odd harmonics are eliminated in the LCR filter section of figure 2-13. A single frequency-
modulated carrier is then made available for further amplification and transmission.
</p><p class="paragraph">Proper design of the multivibrator will cause the frequency deviation of the carrier to faithfully
follow (referred to as a "linear" function) the modulating voltage. This is true up to frequency deviations
which are considerable fractions of the fundamental frequency of the multivibrator. The principal design
consideration is that the RC coupling from one multivibrator transistor base to the collector of the other
has a time constant which is greater than the actual gate length by a factor of 10 or more. Under these
conditions, a rise in base voltage in each transistor is essentially linear from cutoff to the bias at which the
transistor is switched on. Since this rise in base voltage is a linear function of time, the gate length will
change as an inverse function of the modulating voltage. This action will cause the frequency to change as
a linear function of the modulating voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">The multivibrator frequency modulator has the advantage over the reactance-type modulator of a
greater linear frequency deviation from a given carrier frequency. However, multivibrators are limited to
frequencies below about 1 megahertz. Both systems are subject to drift of the carrier frequency and must,
therefore, be stabilized. Stabilization may be accomplished by modulating at a relatively low frequency
and translating by heterodyne action to the desired output frequency, as shown in figure 2-14. A
1-megahertz signal is heterodyned with 49 megahertz from the crystal-controlled oscillator to provide a
stable 50-megahertz output from the mixer. If a suitably stable heterodyning oscillator is used, the
frequency stability can be greatly improved. For instance, at the frequencies shown in figure 2-14, the</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Varactor FM Modulator.—Another fm modulator which is widely used in transistorized circuitry
uses a voltage-variable capacitor (VARACTOR). The varactor is simply a diode, or pn junction, that is
designed to have a certain amount of capacitance between junctions. View (A) of figure 2-15 shows the
varactor schematic symbol. A diagram of a varactor in a simple oscillator circuit is shown in view (B).
This is not a working circuit, but merely a simplified illustration. The capacitance of a varactor, as with
regular capacitors, is determined by the area of the capacitor plates and the distance between the plates.
The depletion region in the varactor is the dielectric and is located between the p and n elements, which
serve as the plates. Capacitance is varied in the varactor by varying the reverse bias which controls the
thickness of the depletion region. The varactor is so designed that the change in capacitance is linear with
the change in the applied voltage. This is a special design characteristic of the varactor diode. The
varactor must not be forward biased because it cannot tolerate much current flow. Proper circuit design
prevents the application of forward bias.

the oscillator. (2) On the negative alternation, the reverse bias decreases, which results in a decrease in
oscillator frequency.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PHASE-MODULATION-2-22-">PHASE MODULATION
</h2><p class="paragraph">Frequency modulation requires the oscillator frequency to deviate both above and below the carrier
frequency. During the process of frequency modulation, the peaks of each successive cycle in the
modulated waveform occur at times other than they would if the carrier were unmodulated. This is
actually an incidental phase shift that takes place along with the frequency shift in fm. Just the opposite
action takes place in phase modulation. The af signal is applied to a PHASE MODULATOR in pm. The
resultant wave from the phase modulator shifts in phase, as illustrated in figure 2-17. Notice that the time
period of each successive cycle varies in the modulated wave according to the audio-wave variation.
Since frequency is a function of time period per cycle, we can see that such a phase shift in the carrier will
cause its frequency to change. The frequency change in fm is vital, but in pm it is merely incidental. The
amount of frequency change has nothing to do with the resultant modulated wave shape in pm. At this
point the comparison of fm to pm may seem a little hazy, but it will clear up as we progress.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s review some voltage phase relationships. Look at figure 2-18 and compare the three voltages
(A, B, and C). Since voltage A begins its cycle and reaches its peak before voltage B, it is said to lead
voltage B. Voltage C, on the other hand, lags voltage B by 30 degrees. In phase modulation the phase of
the carrier is caused to shift at the rate of the af modulating signal. In figure 2-19, note that the
unmodulated carrier has constant phase, amplitude, and frequency. The dotted wave shape represents the
modulated carrier. Notice that the phase on the second peak leads the phase of the unmodulated carrier.
On the third peak the shift is even greater; however, on-the fourth peak, the peaks begin to realign phase
with each other. These relationships represent the effect of 1/2 cycle of an af modulating signal. On the
negative alternation of the af intelligence, the phase of the carrier would lag and the peaks would occur at
times later than they would in the unmodulated carrier.

together with an unmodulated carrier. The two waveforms were drawn together only to show how a
modulated wave looks when compared to an unmodulated wave.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now that you have seen the phase and frequency shifts in both fm and pm, let’s find out exactly how
they differ. First, only the phase shift is important in pm. It is proportional to the af modulating signal. To
visualize this relationship, refer to the wave shapes shown in figure 2-20. Study the composition of the fm
and pm waves carefully as they are modulated with the modulating wave shape. Notice that in fm, the
carrier frequency deviates when the modulating wave changes polarity. With each alternation of the
modulating wave, the carrier advances or retards in frequency and remains at the new frequency for the
duration of that cycle. In pm you can see that between one alternation and the next, the carrier phase must
change, and the frequency shift that occurs does so only during the transition time; the frequency then
returns to its normal rate. Note in the pm wave that the frequency shift occurs only when the modulating
wave is changing polarity. The frequency during the constant amplitude portion of each alternation is the
REST FREQUENCY.
</p><p class="paragraph">The relationship, in pm, of the modulating af to the change in the phase shift is easy to see once you
understand AM and fm principles. Again, we can establish two clear-cut rules of phase modulation:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Phase modulation is also similar to frequency modulation in the number of sidebands that exist
within the modulated wave and the spacing between sidebands. Phase modulation will also produce an
infinite number of sideband frequencies. The spacing between these sidebands will be equal to the
frequency of the modulating signal. However, one factor is very different in phase modulation; that is, the
distribution of power in pm sidebands is not similar to that in fm sidebands, as will be explained in the
next section.

</h3><p class="paragraph">Recall from frequency modulation that modulation index is used to calculate the number of
significant sidebands existing in the waveform. The higher the modulation index, the greater the number

frequency of the modulating signal:

the deviation remained constant) the number of significant sideband pairs decreased. This is shown in

kilohertz, used to modulate a carrier would have the same sideband power distribution. However, the
10-kilohertz sidebands would be farther apart, as shown in views (C) and (D) of figure 2-21. When
compared to fm, the bandwidth of the pm transmitted signal is greatly increased as the frequency of the
modulating signal is increased.
</p><p class="paragraph">As we pointed out earlier, phase modulation cannot occur without an incidental change in frequency,
nor can frequency modulation occur without an incidental change in phase. The term fm is loosely used
when referring to any type of angle modulation, and phase modulation is sometimes incorrectly referred
to as "indirect fm." This is a definition that you should disregard to avoid confusion. Phase modulation is
just what the words imply — phase modulation of a carrier by an af modulating signal. You will develop

</p><p class="paragraph"> C = R.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, let’s vary the resistance and observe how the output is affected in figure 2-23. As the resistance
reaches a value greater than 10 times XC, the phase difference between input and output is nearly 0
degrees. For all practical purposes, the circuit is resistive. As the resistance is decreased to 1/10 the value
of X
</p><p class="paragraph"> C, the phase difference approaches 90 degrees. The circuit is now almost completely capacitive. By
replacing the resistor with a vacuum tube, as shown in view (A) of figure 2-24, we can vary the resistance
(vacuum-tube impedance) by varying the voltage applied to the grid of the tube. The frequency applied to
the circuit (from a crystal-controlled master oscillator) will be shifted in phase by 45 degrees with no
audio input [view (B)]. With the application of an audio signal, the phase will shift as the impedance of
the tube is varied.

the output. Several of these circuits are arranged in cascade to provide the desired amount of phase shift.
Also, since the output of this circuit will vary in amplitude, the signal is fed to a limiter to remove
amplitude variations.
</p><p class="paragraph">The major advantage of this type modulation circuit over frequency modulation is that this circuit
uses a crystal-controlled oscillator to maintain a stable carrier frequency. In fm the oscillator cannot be
crystal controlled because it is actually required to vary in frequency. That means that an fm oscillator
will require a complex automatic frequency control (afc) system. An afc system ensures that the oscillator
stays on the same carrier frequency and achieves a high degree of stability. The afc circuit will be covered
in a later module.

pulses are varied by the modulation frequency. In its simplest form, psk operates on the principle of phase
reversal of the carrier. Each time a mark is received, the phase is reversed. No phase reversal takes place
when a space is received. In binary systems, marks and spaces are called ONES and ZEROS,
respectively, so that a ONE causes a 180-degree phase shift, and a ZERO has no effect on the incoming
signal. Figure 2-25 shows the application of phase-shift keying to an unmodulated carrier [view (A)] in

odd harmonics in addition to its fundamental frequency. Assume that a carrier has a frequency of 1
megahertz. The fundamental frequency of the modulating square wave is 1 kilohertz. When these signals
heterodyne, two new frequencies will be produced: a sum frequency of 1.001 megahertz and a difference
frequency of 0.999 megahertz. The fundamental frequency heterodynes with the carrier. This is also true
of all harmonics contained in the square wave. Side frequencies associated with those harmonics will be
produced as a result of this process. For example, the third harmonic of the square wave heterodynes with
the carrier and produces sideband frequencies at 1.003 and 0.997 megahertz. Another set will be produced

content of the square wave and is 1/3 the amplitude of the first set. The third set is related to the amplitude
of the first set of sidebands and is 115 the amplitude of the first set. This relationship will apply to each

</p><p class="paragraph">Note the frequency spectrum associated with each of these conditions. The carrier amplitude remains
constant, but the sidebands increase in amplitude in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating
square wave.
</p><p class="paragraph">So far in pulse modulation, the same general rules apply as in AM. In view (C) the amplitude of the
square wave of voltage is equal to the peak voltage of the unmodulated carrier wave. This is 100-percent
modulation, just as in conventional AM. Note in the frequency spectrum that the sideband distribution is
also the same as in AM. Keep in mind that the total sideband power is 1/2 of the total power when the
modulator signal is a square wave. This is in contrast to 1/3 the total power with sine-wave modulation.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now refer to view (D). The increase of the square-wave modulating voltage is greater in amplitude
than the unmodulated carrier. Notice that the sideband distribution does not change; but, as the sidebands
take on more of the transmitted power, so will the carrier.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Pulse Timing
</h3><p class="paragraph">Thus far, we have established a carrier and have caused its peaks to increase and decrease as a
modulating square wave is applied. Some pulse-modulation systems modulate a carrier in this manner.
Others produce no rf until pulsed; that is, rf occurs only during the actual pulse as shown in view (A) of
figure 2-30. For example, let’s start with an rf carrier frequency of 1 megahertz. Each cycle of the rf
requires a certain amount of time to complete. If we allow oscillations to occur for a given period of time
only during selected intervals, as in view (B), we are PULSING the system. Note that the pulse
transmitter does not produce an rf signal until one of the positive-going modulating pulses is applied. The
transmitter then produces the rf carrier until the positive input pulse ends and the input waveform again
becomes a negative potential.
</p><p class="paragraph">Refer back to figure 1-41 and the over-modulation discussion in chapter 1. You will notice that the
overmodulation wave shape of view (D) in figure 2-29 and the pulse-modulation wave shape of figure
2-30, view (B), are very similar to figure 1-41.
</p><p class="paragraph">Actually, both figure 1-41 and view (D) of figure 2-29 result from overmodulation. Even though the
output of the pulse transmitter in figure 2-30 looks like overmodulation, it is not; rather, it is pulsed.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the pulse transmitter in figure 2-30 is gated on and off instead of being modulated by a square wave as
was the case in view (D) of figure 2-29.
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember, in pulse modulation the sidebands produced to accompany the carrier during
transmission are directly related to the harmonic content of the modulating wave shape. In figure 2-31,

We must also be concerned with the frequency that is associated with the repetition rate of groups of

TIME (rt). The duration of this rest time will determine certain capabilities of the pulse-modulation
system. The pulse width is the time that the transmitter produces rf oscillations and is the actual pulse
transmission time. During the nonpulse time, shown in figure 2-36, the transmitter produces no
oscillations and the oscillator is cut off.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some pulse transmitter-receiver systems transmit the pulse and then rest, awaiting the return of an
echo. Rest time provides the system time for the receive cycle of operation.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Power in a Pulse System
</h3><p class="paragraph">When discussing power in a pulse-modulation system, we have to consider PEAK POWER and
AVERAGE POWER. Peak power is the maximum value of the transmitted pulse; average power is the
peak power value averaged over the pulse-repetition time. Peak power is very easy to see in a pulse
system. In figure 2-37, all pulsed wave shapes have a peak power of 100 watts. Also note that in views
(A), (B), and (C) the pulse width is the same, even though the carrier frequency is different. In these three
cases average power would be the same. This is because average power is actually equal to the peak
power of a pulse averaged over 1 operating cycle. However, the pulse width is increased in view (D) and
we have a greater average power with the same prt. In view (E) the decreased pulse width has decreased
average power over the same prt.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Duty Cycle
</h3><p class="paragraph">In pulse modulation you will need to know the percentage of time the system is actually producing
rf. For example, let’s say that a pulse system is transmitting 25 percent of the time. This would mean that
the pw is 1/4 the prt. For every 60 minutes we operate the pulse system, we actually transmit a total of
only 15 minutes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The DUTY CYCLE is the ratio of working time to total time for intermittently operated devices.
Thus, duty cycle represents a ratio of actual transmitting time to transmitting time plus rest time. To
establish the duty cycle, divide the pw by the prt of the system. This yields the duty cycle and is
expressed as a decimal figure. With this information, we can figure percentage of transmitting time by
multiplying the duty cycle by 100.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Applications of Pulse Modulation
</h3><p class="paragraph">Pulse modulation has many applications in the transmission of intelligence information. In telemetry,
for example, the width of successive pulses may tell us humidity; the changing of the rest time may tell us
pressure. In other applications, as you will see later in this text, the changing of the average power can
provide us with intelligence information.
</p><p class="paragraph">In radar a pulse is transmitted and travels some distance to a target where it is then reflected back to
the system. The amount of time it takes provides us with information that can be converted to distance.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Radio frequency energy in radar is transmitted in short pulses with time durations that may vary
from 1 to 50 microseconds or more. If the transmitter is cut off before any reflected energy returns from a
target, the receiver can distinguish between the transmitted pulse and the reflected pulse. After all
reflections have returned, the transmitter can again be cut on and the process repeated. The receiver
output is applied to an indicator which measures the time interval between the transmission of energy and
its return as a reflection. Since the energy travels at a constant velocity, the time interval becomes a
measure of the distance traveled (RANGE). Since this method does not depend on the relative frequency
of the returned signal, or on the motion of the target, difficulties experienced in cw or fm methods are not
encountered. The pulse modulation method is used in many military radar applications.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most radar oscillators operate at pulse voltages between 5 and 20 kilovolts. They require currents of
several amperes during the actual pulse which places severe requirements on the modulator. The function
of the high-vacuum tube modulator is to act as a switch to turn a pulse ON and OFF at the transmitter in
response to a control signal. The best device for this purpose is one which requires the least signal power
for control and allows the transfer of power from the transmitter power source to the oscillator with the
least loss. The pulse modulator circuits discussed in this section are typical pulse modulators used in radar

</h3><p class="paragraph">The SPARK-GAP MODULATOR consists of a circuit for storing energy, a circuit for rapidly
discharging the storage circuit (spark gap), a pulse transformer, and an ac power source. The circuit for
storing energy is essentially a short section of artificial transmission line which is known as the
PULSE-FORMING NETWORK (pfn). The pulse-forming network is discharged by a spark gap. Two
types of spark gaps are used: FIXED GAPS and ROTARY GAPS. The fixed gap, discussed in this
section, uses a trigger pulse to ionize the air between the contacts of the spark gap and to initiate the
discharge of the pulse-forming network. The rotary gap is similar to a mechanically driven switch.
</p><p class="paragraph">A typical fixed, spark-gap modulator circuit is shown in figure 2-38. Between trigger pulses the
spark gap is an open circuit. Current flows through the pulse transformer (T1), the pulse-forming network
(C1, C2, C3, C4, and L2), the diode (V1), and the inductor (L1) to the plate supply voltage (Eb). These
components form the charging circuit for the pulse-forming network.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The spark gap is actually triggered (ionized) by the combined action of the charging voltage across
the pulse-forming network and the trigger pulse. (Ionization was discussed in NEETS, Module 6,
Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes and Power Supplies.) The air between the trigger pulse
injection point and ground is ionized by the trigger voltage. This, in turn, initiates the ionization of the
complete gap by the charging voltage. This ionization allows conduction from the charged pulse-forming
network through pulse transformer T1. The output pulse is then applied to an oscillating device, such as a
magnetron.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Thyratron Modulator
</h3><p class="paragraph">The hydrogen THYRATRON MODULATOR is an electronic switch which requires a positive
trigger of only 150 volts. The trigger potential must rise at the rate of 100 volts per microsecond to cause
the modulator to conduct. In contrast to spark gap devices, the hydrogen thyratron (figure 2-39) operates
over a wide range of anode voltages and pulse-repetition rates. The grid has complete control over the
initiation of cathode emission for a wide range of voltages. The anode is completely shielded from the
cathode by the grid. Thus, effective grid action results in very smooth firing over a wide range of anode
voltages and repetition frequencies. Unlike most other thyratrons, the positive grid-control characteristic
ensures stable operation. In addition, deionization time is reduced by using the hydrogen-filled tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">The hydrogen thyratron modulator provides improved timing because the synchronized trigger pulse
is applied to the control grid of the thyratron (V2) and instantaneous firing is obtained. In addition, only</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">one gas tube is required to discharge the pulse-forming network, and a low amplitude trigger pulse is
sufficient to initiate discharge. A damping diode is used to prevent breakdown of the thyratron by
reverse-voltage transients. The thyratron requires a sharp leading edge for a trigger pulse and depends on
a sudden drop in anode voltage (controlled by the pulse-forming network) to terminate the pulse and cut
off the tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">As shown in figure 2-39, the typical thyratron modulator is very similar to the spark-gap modulator.
It consists of a power source (Eb), a circuit for storing energy (L2, C2, C3, C4, and C5), a circuit for
discharging the storage circuit (V2), and a pulse transformer (T1). In addition this circuit has a damping
diode (V1) to prevent reverse-polarity signals from being applied to the plate of V2 which could cause V2
to breakdown.
</p><p class="paragraph">With no trigger pulse applied, the pfn charges through T1, the pfn, and the charging coil L1 to the
potential of Eb. When a trigger pulse is applied to the grid of V2, the tube ionizes causing the pulse-
forming network to discharge through V2 and the primary of T1. As the voltage across the pfn falls below
the ionization point of V2, the tube shuts off. Because of the inductive properties of the pfn, the positive
discharge voltage has a tendency to swing negative. This negative overshoot is prevented from damaging
the thyratron and affecting the output of the circuit by V1, R1, R2, and C1. This is a damping circuit and
provides a path for the overshoot transient through V1. It is dissipated by R1 and R2 with C1 acting as a
high-frequency bypass to ground, preserving the sharp leading and trailing edges of the pulse. The
hydrogen thyratron modulator is the most common radar modulator.
</p><p class="paragraph">Pulse modulation is also useful in communications systems. The intelligence-carrying capability and
power requirements for communications systems differ from those of radar. Therefore, other methods of
achieving pulse modulation that are more suitable for communications systems will now be studied.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMMUNICATIONS-PULSE-MODULATORS-2-41-">COMMUNICATIONS PULSE MODULATORS
</h2><p class="paragraph">To transmit intelligence using pulse modulation, you must provide a method to vary some
characteristic of the pulse train in accordance with the modulating signal. Figure 2-40 illustrates a simple
pulse train. The characteristics of these pulses that can be varied are amplitude, pulse width,
pulse-repetition time, and the pulse position as compared to a reference. In addition to these three
characteristics, pulses may be transmitted according to a code to represent the different levels of the
modulating signal. To ensure maximum fidelity (accuracy in reproducing a modulating wave), the
modulating signal has to be represented by enough pulses to restore the original wave shape. Logically,
the higher the sampling rate (the more often sampled) of the pulse modulator, the more accurately the
original modulating wave can be reproduced. Figure 2-41 illustrates the effectiveness of three
pulse-sampling rates. View (A) shows a sampling rate of more than two times the modulating frequency.
As you can see, this reproduces the modulating signal very accurately. However, the high sampling rate
requires a wide bandwidth and increases the average power required of the transmitter. If less than two
samples per cycle are made, you are not able to reproduce the original modulating signal, as shown in
view (B). View (C) shows a sampling rate that is two times the highest modulating frequency. This is the
minimum sampling rate that will give a sufficiently accurate reproduction of the modulating wave. The
standard sampling rate is 2.5 times the highest frequency that is to be transmitted. This ensures the ability
to accurately reproduce the modulating waveform. In military voice systems the bandwidth for voice
signals is limited to 300 to 3,000 hertz, requiring a sampling frequency of 8 kilohertz. Although the pulse
characteristic that is changed may vary for each type of pulse modulation, the sampling frequency will
remain constant. We will now briefly discuss common types of pulse modulation.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Pulse-Amplitude Modulation
</h3><p class="paragraph">Some characteristic of the sampling pulses must be varied by the modulating signal for the
intelligence of the signal to be present in the pulsed wave. Figure 2-42 shows three typical waveforms in
which the pulse amplitude is varied by the amplitude of the modulating signal. View (A) represents a sine
wave of intelligence to be modulated on a transmitted carrier wave. View (B) shows the timing pulses
which determine the sampling interval. View (C) shows PULSE-AMPLITUDE MODULATION (pam) in
which the amplitude of each pulse is controlled by the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal at
the time of each pulse.
</p><p class="paragraph">Pulse-amplitude modulation is the simplest form of pulse modulation. It is generated in much the
same manner as analog-amplitude modulation. The timing pulses are applied to a pulse amplifier in which
the gain is controlled by the modulating waveform. Since these variations in amplitude actually represent
the signal, this type of modulation is basically a form of AM. The only difference is that the signal is now
in the form of pulses. This means that pam has the same built-in weaknesses as any other AM signal -
high susceptibility to noise and interference. The reason for susceptibility to noise is that any interference
in the transmission path will either add to or subtract from any voltage already in the circuit (signal
voltage). Thus, the amplitude of the signal will be changed. Since the amplitude of the voltage represents
the signal, any unwanted change to the signal is considered a SIGNAL DISTORTION. For this reason,
pam is not often used. When pam is used, the pulse train is used to frequency modulate a carrier for
transmission. Techniques of pulse modulation other than pam have been developed to overcome problems
of noise interference. The following sections will discuss other types of pulse modulation.

by varying any of its characteristics. In the preceding paragraphs the method of modulating a pulse train
by varying its amplitude was discussed. Time characteristics of pulses may also be modulated with
intelligence information. Two time characteristics may be affected: (1) the time duration of the pulses,
referred to as PULSE-DURATION MODULATION (pdm) or PULSE-WIDTH MODULATION (pwm);
and (2) the time of occurrence of the pulses, referred to as PULSE-POSITION MODULATION (ppm),
and a special type of PULSE-TIME MODULATION (ptm) referred to as PULSE-FREQUENCY
MODULATION (pfm). Figure 2-43 shows these types of ptm in views (C), (D), and (E). Views (A) and

modulation. The width of each pulse in a train is made proportional to the instantaneous value of the

the pulses may be modulated to produce the variation in pulse width. Pdm can be obtained in a number of
ways, one of which is illustrated in views (A) through (D) in figure 2-44. A circuit to produce pdm is
shown in figure 2-45. Adding the modulating signal [figure 2-44, view (A)] to a repetitive sawtooth [view

changes state when the input signal exceeds a specific threshold level. This action produces pulses with
widths that are determined by the length of time that the input waveform exceeds the threshold level. The
resulting waveform is shown in view (D).

</p><p class="paragraph">In the circuit of figure 2-45, a series of sawtooth pulses, occurring at the sampling rate, is applied to
a one-shot multivibrator. The multivibrator has the signal voltage Essuperimposed on the bias voltage Ein.
Each pulse triggers a cycle of multivibrator operation which terminates after a time interval and varies
linearly with the voltage Es. The pulse of plate voltage produced by the multivibrator will have a leading
edge at T1. The leading edge will vary in position with the signal voltage, while the trailing edge at T2 is
fixed by the termination of the sawtooth pulse. The length of the output pulse is thus duration or width
modulated. If the sawtooth has an instantaneous buildup and a sloping trailing edge, then the leading edge
(T1) is fixed and the trailing edge (T2) varies. If the sawtooth generator produces a slope on both leading
and trailing edges, both T1 and T2 are variable in position, but the result is still pdm. Pdm is often used
because it is of a constant amplitude and is, therefore, less susceptible to noise. When compared with
ppm, pdm has the disadvantage of a varying pulse, width and, therefore, of varying power content. This
means that the transmitter must be powerful enough to handle the maximum-width pulses, although the
average power transmitted is much less than peak power. On the other hand, pdm will still work if the
synchronization between the transmitter and receiver fails; in ppm it will not, as will be seen in the next
section.
</p><p class="paragraph">PULSE-POSITION MODULATION.—The amplitude and width of the pulse is kept constant in
the system. The position of each pulse, in relation to the position of a recurrent reference pulse, is varied
by each instantaneous sampled value of the modulating wave. Ppm has the advantage of requiring
constant transmitter power since the pulses are of constant amplitude and duration. It is widely used but
has the disadvantage of depending on transmitter-receiver synchronization.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Ppm can be generated in several ways, but we will discuss one of the simplest. Figure 2-46 shows
three waveforms associated with developing ppm from pdm. The pdm pulse train is applied to a
differentiating circuit. (Differentiation was presented in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to
Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits.) This provides positive- and negative-polarity pulses that
correspond to the leading and trailing edges of the pdm pulses. Considering pdm and its generation, you
can see that each pulse has a leading and trailing edge. In this case the position of the leading edge is
fixed, whereas the trailing edge is not, as shown in view (A) of figure 2-46. The resultant pulses after the
differentiation are shown in view (B). The negative pulses are position-modulated in accordance with the
modulating waveform. Both the negative and positive pulse are then applied to a rectification circuit. This
application eliminates the positive, non-modulated pulses and develops a ppm pulse train, as shown in
view (C).
</p><p class="paragraph">PULSE-FREQUENCY MODULATION.—Pfm is a method of pulse modulation in which the
modulating wave is used to frequency modulate a pulse-generating circuit. For example, the pulse rate
may be 8,000 pulses per second (pps) when the signal voltage is 0. The pulse rate may step up to 9,000
pps for maximum positive signal voltage, and down to 7,000 pps for maximum negative signal voltage.
Figure 2-47, views (A), (B), and (C) show three typical waveforms for pfm. This method of modulation is
not used extensively because of complicated pfm generation methods. It requires a stable oscillator that is
frequency modulated to drive a pulse generator. Since the other forms of ptm are easier to achieve, they
are commonly used.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Pulse-Code Modulation
</h3><p class="paragraph">PULSE-CODE MODULATION (pcm) refers to a system in which the standard values of a
QUANTIZED WAVE (explained in the following paragraphs) are indicated by a series of coded pulses.
When these pulses are decoded, they indicate the standard values of the original quantized wave. These
codes may be binary, in which the symbol for each quantized element will consist of pulses and spaces:
ternary, where the code for each element consists of any one of three distinct kinds of values (such as
positive pulses, negative pulses, and spaces); or n-ary, in which the code for each element consists of nay
number (n) of distinct values. This discussion will be based on the binary pcm system.
</p><p class="paragraph">All of the pulse-modulation systems discussed previously provide methods of converting analog
wave shapes to digital wave shapes (pulses occurring at discrete intervals, some characteristic of which is
varied as a continuous function of the analog wave). The entire range of amplitude (frequency or phase)
values of the analog wave can be arbitrarily divided into a series of standard values. Each pulse of a pulse
train [figure 2-48, view (B)] takes the standard value nearest its actual value when modulated. The
modulating wave can be faithfully reproduced, as shown in views (C) and (D). The amplitude range has
been divided into 5 standard values in view (C). Each pulse is given whatever standard value is nearest its
actual instantaneous value. In view (D), the same amplitude range has been divided into 10 standard
levels. The curve of view (D) is a much closer approximation of the modulating wave, view (A), than is
the 5-level quantized curve in view (C). From this you should see that the greater the number of standard
levels used, the more closely the quantized wave approximates the original. This is also made evident by
the fact that an infinite number of standard levels exactly duplicates the conditions of nonquantization
(the original analog waveform).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

32(25) . . . N(2n). The reason for selecting levels at exponential values of 2 will become evident in the
discussion of pcm. Quantized fm is similar in every way to quantized AM. That is, the range of frequency
deviation is divided into a finite number of standard values of deviation. Each sampling pulse results in a
deviation equal to the standard value nearest the actual deviation at the sampling instant. Similarly, for
phase modulation, quantization establishes a set of standard values. Quantization is used mostly in
amplitude- and frequency-modulated pulse systems.

are important. The next step up would be a 32-level code, with each decimal number represented by a
series of five binary digits, rather than the four digits of figure 2-49. Six-digit groups would provide a

</p><p class="paragraph">As a matter of convenience, especially to simplify the demodulation of pcm, the pulse trains actually
transmitted are reversed from those shown in figures 2-49, 2-50, and 2-51; that is, the pulse with the
lowest binary value (least significant digit) is transmitted first and the succeeding pulses have increasing
binary values up to the code limit (most significant digit). Pulse coding can be performed in a number of
ways using conventional circuitry or by means of special cathode ray coding tubes. One form of coding
circuit is shown in figure 2-52. In this case, the pulse samples are applied to a holding circuit (a capacitor
which stores pulse amplitude information) and the modulator converts pam to pdm. The pdm pulses are
then used to gate the output of a precision pulse generator that controls the number of pulses applied to a
binary counter. The duration of the gate pulse is not necessarily an integral number of the repetition
pulses from the precisely timed clock-pulse generator. Therefore, the clock pulses gated into the binary
counter by the pdm pulse may be a number of pulses plus the leading edge of an additional pulse. This
"partial" pulse may have sufficient duration to trigger the counter, or it may not. The counter thus
responds only to integral numbers, effectively quantizing the signal while, at the same time, encoding it.
Each bistable stage of the counter stores ZERO or a ONE for each binary digit it represents (binary 1110
or decimal 14 is shown in figure 2-52). An electronic commutator samples the 20, 21, 22, and 23 digit
positions in sequence and transmits a mark or space bit (pulse or no pulse) in accordance with the state of
each counter stage. The holding circuit is always discharged and reset to zero before initiation of the
sequence for the next pulse sample.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The pcm demodulator will reproduce the correct standard amplitude represented by the pulse-code
group. However, it will reproduce the correct standard only if it is able to recognize correctly the presence
or absence of pulses in each position. For this reason, noise introduces no error at all if the signal-to-noise
ration is such that the largest peaks of noise are not mistaken for pulses. When the noise is random (circuit
and tube noise), the probability of the appearance of a noise peak comparable in amplitude to the pulses
can be determined. This probability can be determined mathematically for any ration of signal-to-average-
noise power. When this is done for 10 5 pulses per second, the approximate error rate for three values of
signal power to average noise power is:
</p><h3 class="subsection">17 dB — 10 errors per second
</h3><h3 class="subsection">20 dB — 1 error every 20 minutes
</h3><h3 class="subsection">22 dB — 1 error every 2,000 hours
</h3><p class="paragraph">Above a threshold of signal-to-noise ration of approximately 20 dB, virtually no errors occur. In all
other systems of modulation, even with signal-to-noise ratios as high as 60 dB, the noise will have some
effect. Moreover, the pcm signal can be retransmitted, as in a multiple relay link system, as many times as
desired, without the introduction of additional noise effects; that is, noise is not cumulative at relay
stations as it is with other modulation systems.
</p><p class="paragraph">The system does, of course, have some distortion introduced by quantizing the signal. Both the
standard values selected and the sampling interval tend to make the reconstructed wave depart from the
original. This distortion, called QUANTIZING NOISE, is initially introduced at the quantizing and
coding modulator and remains fixed throughout the transmission and retransmission processes. Its
magnitude can be reduced by making the standard quantizing levels closer together. The relationship of
the quantizing noise to the number of digits in the binary code is given by the following standard
relationship:
</p><p class="paragraph">Where:
</p><h3 class="subsection">n is the number of digits in the binary code</h3><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Thus, with the 4-digit code of figure 2-50 and 2-51, the quantizing noise will be about 35 dB weaker
than the peak signal which the channel will accommodate.
</p><p class="paragraph">The advantages of pcm are two-fold. First, noise interference is almost completely eliminated when
the pulse signals exceed noise levels by a value of 20 dB or more. Second, the signal may be received and
retransmitted as many times as may be desired without introducing distortion into the signal.

</h2><p class="paragraph">In chapters 1 and 2 you studied how to apply intelligence (modulation) to an rf-carrier wave. Carrier
modulation allows the transmission of modulating frequencies without the use of transmission wire as a
medium. However, for the communication process to be completed or to be useful, the intelligence must
be recovered in its original form at the receiving site. The process of re-creating original modulating
frequencies (intelligence) from the rf carrier is referred to as DEMODULATION or DETECTION. Each
type of modulation is different and requires different techniques to recover (demodulate) the intelligence.
In this chapter we will discuss ways of demodulating AM, cw, fm, phase, and pulse modulation.
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit in which restoration is achieved is called the DETECTOR or DEMODULATOR (both of
these terms are used in NEETS). The term demodulator is used because the demodulation process is
considered to be the opposite of modulation. The output of an ideal detector must be an exact
reproduction of the modulation existing on the rf wave. Failure to accurately recover this intelligence will
result in distortion and degradation of the demodulated signal and intelligence will be lost. The distortion
may be in amplitude, frequency, or phase, depending on the nature of the demodulator. A nonlinear
device is required for demodulation. This nonlinear device is required to recover the modulating
frequencies from the rf envelope. Solid-state detector circuits may be either a pn junction diode or the
input junction of a transistor. In electron-tube circuits, either a diode or the grid or plate circuits of a
triode electron tube may be used as the nonlinear device.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Continuous-wave (cw) modulation consists of on-off keying of a carrier wave. To recover on-off
keyed information, we need a method of detecting the presence or absence of rf oscillations. The CW
DEMODULATOR detects the presence of rf oscillations and converts them into a recognizable form.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the received cw in view (A), the rectified cw from a diode detector in view (B), and
the dc output from a filter that can be used to control a relay or light indicator in view (C).
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-2 is a, simplified circuit that could be used as a cw demodulator. The antenna receives the rf
oscillations from the transmitter. The tank circuit, L and C1, acts as a frequency-selective network that is
tuned to the desired rf carrier frequency. The diode rectifies the oscillations and C2 provides filtering to
provide a constant dc output to control the headset. This demodulator circuit is the equivalent of a wire
telegraphy circuit but it has certain disadvantages. For example, if two transmitters are very close in
frequency, distinguishing which transmitting station you are receiving is often impossible without a
method of fine tuning the desired frequency. Also, if the stations are within the frequency bandpass of the
input tank circuit, the tank output will contain a mixture of both signals. Therefore, a method, such as
HETERODYNE DETECTION, must be used which provides more than just the information on the
presence or absence of a signal.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The use of an af voltage in the detector aids the operator in distinguishing between various signals.
Since the carrier is unmodulated, the af voltage can be developed by using the heterodyne procedure
discussed in chapter 1. The procedure is to mix the incoming cw signal with locally generated
oscillations. This provides a convenient difference frequency in the af range, such as 1,000 hertz. The af
difference frequency then is rectified and smoothed by a detector. The af voltage is reproduced by a
telephone headset or a loudspeaker.
</p><p class="paragraph">Consider the heterodyne reception of the code letter A, as shown in figure 3-3, view (A). The code
consists of a short burst of cw energy (dot) followed by a longer burst (dash). Assume that the frequency
of the received cw signal is 500 kilohertz. The locally generated oscillations are adjusted to a frequency
which is higher or lower than the incoming rf signal (501 kilohertz in this case), as shown in view (B).
The voltage resulting from the heterodyning action between the cw signal [view (A)] and the local
oscillator signal [view (B)] is shown in view (C) as the mixed-frequency signal. ENVELOPE
(intelligence) amplitude varies at the BEAT (difference) frequency of 1,000 hertz (501,000 -  500,000).
The negative half cycles of the mixed frequency are rectified, as shown in view (D). The peaks of the
positive half cycles follow the 1,000-hertz beat frequency.

station in the previous example had been operating at 10,002,000 hertz, then both stations would have
produced a 1,000-hertz beat frequency and interference would have occurred. Adjusting the
local-oscillator frequency to 9,999,000 hertz would have caused the desired station at 10,000,000 hertz to
produce a 1,000-hertz beat frequency. The other station, at 10,002,000 hertz, would have produced a beat
frequency of 3,000 hertz. Either selective circuits or the operator can easily distinguish between these
widely differing tones. A trained operator can use the variable local oscillator to distinguish between
stations that vary in frequency by only a few hundred hertz.

energy fed back to the tank circuit from the collector-output circuit (by physically moving tickler coil L2
closer to L1 using the regeneration control). This feedback overcomes losses in the base-input circuit and
causes self-oscillations which are controlled by tuning capacitor C1. The received signal from the antenna
and the oscillating frequency are both present at the base of transistor Q1. These two frequencies are
heterodyned by the nonlinearity of the transistor. The resulting beat frequencies are then rectified by the
emitter-base junction and produce a beat note which is amplified in the collector-output circuit. The af

the regenerative detector for low-frequency code reception, however, is usually avoided. At low

varying its amplitude in accordance with the message intelligence that is to be transmitted. This is
accomplished by heterodyning the intelligence frequency with the carrier frequency. The vector
summation of the carrier, sum, and difference frequencies causes the modulation envelope to vary in
amplitude at the intelligence frequency, as discussed in chapter 1. In this section we will discuss several
circuits that can be used to recover this intelligence from the variations in the modulation envelope.

either a vacuum tube or a semiconductor diode. The basic detector circuit is shown in its simplest form in
view (A) of figure 3-5. Views (B), (C), and  (D) show the circuit waveforms. The demodulator must meet
three requirements: (1) It must be sensitive to the type of modulation applied at the input, (2) it must be
nonlinear, and (3) it must provide filtering. Remember that the AM waveform appears like the diagram of
view (B) and the amplitude variations of the peaks represent the original audio signal, but  no modulating
signal frequencies exist in this waveform. The waveform contains only three rf frequencies: (1) the
carrier frequency, (2) the sum frequency, and (3) the difference frequency. The modulating intelligence is
contained in the difference between these frequencies. The vector addition of these frequencies provides
the modulation envelope which approximates the original modulating waveform. It is this modulation
envelope that the DIODE DETECTORS use to reproduce the original modulating frequencies.

This varying af voltage is applied to the headset which then reproduces the original modulating

</h3><p class="paragraph">The SHUNT-DIODE DETECTOR (figure 3-6) is similar to the series-diode detector except that the
output variations are current pulses rather than voltage pulses. Passing this current through a shunt
resistor develops the voltage output. The input is an rf modulated envelope. On the negative half cycles of
the rf, diode CR1 is forward biased and shunts the signal to ground. On the positive half cycles, current
flows from the output through L1 to the input. A field is built up around L1 that tends to keep the current
flowing. This action integrates the rf current pulses and causes the output to follow the modulation
envelope (intelligence) closely. (Integration was discussed in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to
Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits.) Shunt resistor R1 develops the output voltage from this
current flow. Although the shunt detector operates on the principle of current flow, it is the output voltage
across the shunt resistor that is used to reproduce the original modulation signal. The shunt-diode detector
is easily identified by noting that the detector diode is in parallel with both the input and load impedance.
The waveforms associated with this detector are identical to those shown in views (B), (C), and (D) of

</h2><p class="paragraph">The COMMON-EMITTER DETECTOR is often used in receivers to supply an amplified detected
output. The schematic for a typical transistor common-emitter detector is shown in figure 3-7. Input
transformer T1 has a tuned primary that acts as a frequency-selective device. L2 inductively couples the
input modulation envelope to the base of transistor Q1. Resistors R1 and R2 are fixed-bias voltage
dividers that set the bias levels for Q1. Resistor R1 is bypassed by C2 to eliminate rf. This RC
combination also acts as the load for the diode detector (emitter-base junction of Q1). The detected audio
is in series with the biasing voltage and controls collector current. The output is developed across R4
which is also bypassed to remove rf by C4. R3 is a temperature stabilization resistor and C3 bypasses it
for both rf and af.
</p><p class="question">Q1 is biased for slight conduction with no input signal applied. When an input signal appears on the
base of Q1, it is rectified by the emitter-base junction (operating as a diode) and is developed across R1 as
a dc bias voltage with a varying af component. This voltage controls bias and collector current for Q1.
The output is developed by collector current flow through R4. Any rf ripple in the output is bypassed
across the collector load resistor by capacitor C4. The af variations are not bypassed. After the modulation
envelope is detected in the base circuit, it is amplified in the output circuit to provide suitable af output.
The output of this circuit is higher than is possible with a simple detector. Because of the amplification in
this circuit, weaker signals can be detected than with a simple detector. A higher, more usable output is
thus developed.

In this circuit detection occurs in the emitter-base junction and amplification occurs at the output of the
collector junction. The output developed is the equivalent of a diode detector which is followed by a stage
of audio amplification, but with more distortion. Figure 3-8 is a schematic of a typical common-base
detector. Transformer T1 is tuned by capacitor C3 to the frequency of the incoming modulated envelope.
Resistor R1 and capacitor C1 form a self-biasing network which sets the dc operating point of the emitter
junction. The af output is taken from the collector circuit through audio transformer T2. The primary of
T2 forms the detector output load and is bypassed for rf by capacitor C2.
</p><p class="paragraph">The input signal is coupled through T1. When capacitor C3 is tuned to the proper frequency, the
signal is passed to the emitter of Q1. When no input signal is present, bias is determined by resistor R1.
When the input signal becomes positive, current flows through the emitter-base junction causing it to be
forward biased. C1 and R1 establish the dc operating point by acting as a filter network. This action
provides a varying dc voltage that follows the peaks of the rf modulated envelope. This action is identical
to the diode detector with the emitter-base junction doing the detecting. The varying dc voltage on the
emitter changes the bias on Q1 and causes collector current to vary in accordance with the detected
voltage. Transformer T2 couples these af current changes to the output. Thus, Q1 detects the AM wave
and then provides amplification for the detected waveform.

</h2><p class="paragraph">To be able to understand the principles of operation for fm detectors, you need to first study the
simplest form of frequency-modulation detector, the SLOPE DETECTOR. The slope detector is
essentially a tank circuit which is tuned to a frequency either slightly above or below the fm carrier
frequency. View (A) of figure 3-9 is a plot of voltage versus frequency for a tank circuit. The resonant
frequency of the tank is the frequency at point 4. Components are selected so that the resonant frequency
is higher than the frequency of the fm carrier signal at point 2. The entire frequency deviation for the fm
signal falls on the lower slope of the bandpass curve between points 1 and 3. As the fm signal is applied
to the tank circuit in view (B), the output amplitude of the signal varies as its frequency swings closer to,
or further from, the resonant frequency of the tank. Frequency variations will still be present in this
waveform, but it will also develop amplitude variations, as shown in view (B). This is because of the
response of the tank circuit as it varies with the input frequency. This signal is then applied to the diode
detector in view (C) and the detected waveform is the output. This circuit has the major disadvantage that
any amplitude variations in the rf waveform will pass through the tank circuit and be detected. This
disadvantage can be eliminated by placing a limiter circuit before the tank input. (Limiter circuits were
discussed in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits.) This
circuit is basically the same as an AM detector with the tank tuned to a higher or lower frequency than the
received carrier.

it is 90 degrees out of phase with the current through it. Because of the center-tap arrangement, the

Equal anode voltages on diodes CR1 and CR2 produce equal currents and, with equal load resistors, equal

</p><p class="paragraph">The diodes conduct on opposite half cycles of the input waveform and produce a series of dc pulses
at the rf rate. This rf ripple is filtered out by capacitors C3 and C4.
</p><p class="paragraph">OPERATION ABOVE RESONANCE.—A phase shift occurs when an input frequency higher
than the center frequency is applied to the discriminator circuit and the current and voltage phase
relationships change. When a series-tuned circuit operates at a frequency above resonance, the inductive
reactance of the coil increases and the capacitive reactance of the capacitor decreases. Above resonance
the tank circuit acts like an inductor. Secondary current lags the primary tank voltage, ep. Notice that
secondary voltages e
</p><p class="paragraph"> 1 and e2 are still 180 degrees out of phase with the current (iS) that produces them.
The change to a lagging secondary current rotates the vectors in a clockwise direction. This causes el to
become more in phase with ep while e2 is shifted further out of phase with ep. The vector sum of ep and e2
is less than that of ep and e1. Above the center frequency, diode CR1 conducts more than diode CR2.
Because of this heavier conduction, the voltage developed across R3 is greater than the voltage developed
across R4; the output voltage is positive.
</p><p class="paragraph">OPERATION BELOW RESONANCE.—When the input frequency is lower than the center
frequency, the current and voltage phase relationships change. When the tuned circuit is operated at a
frequency lower than resonance, the capacitive reactance increases and the inductive reactance decreases.
Below resonance the tank acts like a capacitor and the secondary current leads primary tank voltage ep.
This change to a leading secondary current rotates the vectors in a counterclockwise direction. From the
vector diagram you should see that e2 is brought nearer in phase with ep, while el is shifted further out of
phase with ep. The vector sum of ep and e2 is larger than that of e and e1. Diode CR2 conducts more than
diode CR1 below the center frequency. The voltage drop across R4 is larger than that across R3 and the
output across both is negative.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Disadvantages
</h3><p class="paragraph">These voltage outputs can be plotted to show the response curve of the discriminator discussed
earlier (figure 3-10). When weak AM signals (too small in amplitude to reach the circuit limiting level)
pass through the limiter stages, they can appear in the output. These unwanted amplitude variations will
cause primary voltage ep [view (A) of figure 3-11] to fluctuate with the modulation and to induce a
similar voltage in the secondary of T1. Since the diodes are connected as half-wave rectifiers, these small
AM signals will be detected as they would be in a diode detector and will appear in the output. This
unwanted AM interference is cancelled out in the ratio detector (to be studied next in this chapter) and is
the main disadvantage of the Foster-Seeley circuit.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RATIO-DETECTOR-3-15-">RATIO DETECTOR
</h2><p class="paragraph">The RATIO DETECTOR uses a double-tuned transformer to convert the instantaneous frequency
variations of the fm input signal to instantaneous amplitude variations. These amplitude variations are
then rectified to provide a dc output voltage which varies in amplitude and polarity with the input signal
frequency. This detector demodulates fm signals and suppresses amplitude noise without the need of
limiter stages.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Circuit Operation
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-12 shows a typical ratio detector. The input tank capacitor (C1) and the primary of
transformer T1 (L1) are tuned to the center frequency of the fm signal to be demodulated. The secondary
winding of T1 (L2) and capacitor C2 also form a tank circuit tuned to the center frequency. Tertiary
(third) winding L3 provides additional inductive coupling which reduces the loading effect of the
secondary on the primary circuit. Diodes CR1 and CR2 rectify the signal from the secondary tank.
Capacitor C5 and resistors R1 and R2 set the operating level of the detector. Capacitors C3 and C4
determine the amplitude and polarity of the output. Resistor R3 limits the peak diode current and
furnishes a dc return path for the rectified signal. The output of the detector is taken from the common
connection between C3 and C4. Resistor RL is the load resistor. R5, C6, and C7 form a low-pass filter to
the output.
</p><p class="paragraph">This circuit operates on the same principles of phase shifting as did the Foster-Seeley discriminator.
In that discussion, vector diagrams were used to illustrate the voltage amplitudes and polarities for
conditions at resonance, above resonance, and below resonance. The same vector diagrams apply to the
ratio detector but will not be discussed here. Instead, you will study the resulting current flows and
polarities on simplified schematic diagrams of the detector circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">OPERATION AT RESONANCE.—When the input voltage ep is applied to the primary in figure
3-12 it also appears across L3 because, by inductive coupling, it is effectively connected in parallel with
the primary tank circuit. At the same time, a voltage is induced in the secondary winding and causes
current to flow around the secondary tank circuit. At resonance the tank acts like a resistive circuit; that is,</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">the tank current is in phase with the primary voltage ep. The current flowing in the tank circuit causes
voltages e1 and e2 to be developed in the secondary winding of T1. These voltages are of equal magnitude
and of opposite polarity with respect to the center tap of the winding. Since the winding is inductive, the
voltage drop across it is 90 degrees out of phase with the current through it.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-13 is a simplified schematic diagram of a ratio detector at resonance. The voltage applied to
the cathode of CR1 is the vector sum of e1 and ep. Likewise, the voltage applied to the anode of CR2 is
the vector sum of e2  and ep. No phase shift occurs at resonance and both voltages are equal. Both diodes
conduct equally. This equal current flow causes the same voltage drop across both R1 and R2. C3 and C4
will charge to equal voltages with opposite polarities. Let’s assume that the voltages across C3 and C4 are
equal in amplitude (5 volts) and of opposite polarity and the total charge across C5 is 10 volts. R1 and R2
will each have 5 volts dropped across them because they are of equal values. The output is taken between
points A and B. To find the output voltage, you algebraically add the voltages between points A and B
(loop ACB or ADB). Point A to point D is - 5 volts. Point D to point B is + 5 volts. Their algebraic sum is
0 volts and the output voltage is 0 at resonance. If the voltages on branch ACB were figured, the same
output would be found because the circuit branches are in parallel.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the input signal reverses polarity, the secondary voltage across L2 also reverses. The diodes
will be reverse biased and no current will flow. Meanwhile, C5 retains most of its charge because of the
long time constant offered in combination with R1 and R2. This slow discharge helps to maintain the
output.

cathode of CR1 is greater than the voltage applied to the anode of CR2 above resonance.

of CR1 causes C3 to charge to 8 volts. The lower voltage on the anode of CR2 causes C4 to charge to 2
volts. Capacitor C5 remains charged to the sum of these two voltages, 10 volts. Again, by adding the
voltages in loop ACB or ADB between points A and B, you can find the output voltage. Point A to point
D equals -2 volts. Point D to point B equals +5 volts. Their algebraic sum, and the output, equals +3 volts
when tuned above resonance. During the negative half cycle of the input signal, the diodes are reverse
biased and C5 helps maintain a constant output.
</p><p class="paragraph">OPERATION BELOW RESONANCE.—When a tuned circuit operates below resonance (figure
3-15), it is capacitive. Secondary current is leads the primary voltage ep and secondary voltage e2 is nearer
in phase with primary voltage ep. The vector sum of e2 and ep is larger than the sum of e1 and ep. The
voltage applied to the anode of CR2 becomes greater than the voltage applied to the cathode of CR1
below resonance.

- 8 volts plus +5 volts, or - 3 volts, when tuned below resonance. During the negative half cycle of the
input signal, the diodes are reverse biased and C5 helps maintain a constant output.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Advantage of a Ratio Detector
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ratio detector is not affected by amplitude variations on the fm wave. The output of the detector
adjusts itself automatically to the average amplitude of the input signal. C5 charges to the sum of the
voltages across R1 and R2 and, because of its time constant, tends to filter out any noise impulses. Before
C5 can charge or discharge to the higher or lower potential, the noise disappears. The difference in charge
across C5 is so slight that it is not discernible in the output. Ratio detectors can operate with as little as
100 millivolts of input. This is much lower than that required for limiter saturation and less gain is
required from preceding stages.

input frequency drops below the center frequency, the output voltage goes negative.

</h3><p class="paragraph">The gated-beam detector employs a specially designed gated-beam tube. The elements of this tube
are shown in figure 3-17. The focus electrode forms a shield around the tube cathode except for a narrow
slot through which the electron beam flows. The beam of electrons flows toward the limiter grid which
acts like a gate. When the gate is open, the electron beam flows through to the next grid. When closed, the
gate completely stops the beam.
</p><p class="paragraph">After the electron beam passes the limiter grid, the screen grid refocuses the beam toward the
quadrature grid. The quadrature grid acts much the same as the limiter grid; it either opens or closes the
passage for electrons. These two grids act similar to an AND gate in digital devices; both gates must be
open for the passage of electrons to the plate. Either grid can cut off plate current. AND gates were
presented in NEETS, Module 13, Introduction to Number Systems, Boolean Algebra, and Logic Circuits.

demodulator and its waveforms [views (B) and (C)]. CR1 is the input diode which allows capacitor C1 to
charge to the peak value of the pam input pulse. Pam input pulses are shown in view (B). CR1 is reverse
biased between input pulses to isolate the detector circuit from the input. CR2 and CR3 are biased so that
they are normally nonconducting. The discharge path for the capacitor is through the resistor (R1). These
components are chosen so that their time constant is at least 10 times the interpulse period (time between
pulses). This maintains the charge on C1 between pulses by allowing only a small discharge before the
next pulse is applied. The capacitor is discharged just prior to each input pulse to allow the output voltage
to follow the peak value of the input pulses. This discharge is through CR2 and CR3. These diodes are
turned on by a negative pulse from a source that is time-synchronous with the timing-pulse train at the
transmitter. Diode CR3 ensures that the output voltage is near 0 during this discharge period. View (C)

CR1. The amplitude of the voltage to which C1 charges, before being discharged by the negative pulse,
will be directly proportional to the input pulse width. A longer pulse width allows C1 to charge to a
higher potential than a short pulse. This charge is held, because of the long time constant of R1 and C1,

</h2><p class="paragraph">Pulse-position modulation (ppm), pulse-frequency modulation (pfm), and pulse-code modulation
(pcm) are most easily demodulated by first converting them to either pdm or pam. After conversion these
pulses are demodulated using either peak detection or a low-pass filter. This conversion may be done in
many ways, but your study will be limited to the simpler methods.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Pulse-Position Modulation
</h3><p class="paragraph">Ppm can be converted to pdm by using a flip-flop circuit. (Flip flops were discussed in NEETS,
Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits.) Figure 3-22 shows the
waveforms for conversion of ppm to pdm. View (A) is the pulse-modulated pulse train and view (B) is a
series of reset trigger pulses. The trigger pulses must be synchronized with the unmodulated position of
the ppm pulses, but with a fixed time delay from these pulses. As the position-modulated pulse is applied
to the flip-flop, the output is driven positive, as shown in view (C). After a period of time, the trigger
pulse is again generated and drives the flip-flop output negative and the pulse ends. Because the ppm
pulses are constantly varying in position with reference to the unmodulated pulses, the output of the flip-
flop also varies in duration or width. This pdm signal can now be applied to one of the circuits that has
already been discussed for demodulation.
</p><p class="paragraph">Pulse-frequency modulation is a variation of ppm and may be converted by the same method.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Pulse-Code Modulation
</h3><p class="paragraph">Pulse-code modulation can easily be decoded, provided the pulse-code groups have been transmitted
in reverse order; that is, if the pulse with the lowest value is transmitted first, the pulse with the highest
value is transmitted last. A circuit that will provide a constant value of current without regard to its load is
known as a current source. A current source is used to apply the pcm pulses to an RC circuit, such as that
shown in figure 3-23, view (A). The current source must be capable of supplying a linear charge to C1
that will increase each time a pulse is applied if C1 is not allowed to discharge between pulses. In other
words, if C1 charges to 16 volts during the period of one pulse, then each additional pulse increases the
charge by 16 volts. Thus, the cumulative value increases by 16 volts for each received pulse. This does
not provide a usable output unless a resistor is chosen that allows C1 to discharge to one-half its value
between pulses. If only one pulse is received at T1, C1 charges to 16 volts and then begins to discharge.
At T2 the charge has decayed to 8 volts and continues to decay unless another pulse is received. At T3 it
has a 4-volt charge and at T4 it only has a 2-volt charge. At the sampling time, a 1-volt charge remains;
this charge corresponds to the binary-weighted pulse train of 0001. Now we will apply a pcm signal
which corresponds to the binary-coded equivalent of 7 volts (0111) in figure 3-23, view (A). View (B) is
the pulse code that is received. Remember that the pulses are transmitted in reverse order. View (C) is the
response curve of the circuit. At T1 the pulse corresponding to the least significant digit is applied and C1
charges to 16 volts. C1 discharges between pulses until it reaches 8 volts at T2. At T2 another pulse
charges it to 24 volts. At T3, C1 has discharged through R1 to a value of 12 volts. The pulse at T3
increases the charge on C1 by 16 volts to a total charge of 28 volts. At T4, C1 has discharged to one-half
its value and is at 14 volts. No pulse is present at T4 so C1 will not receive an additional charge. C1
continues to discharge until T5 when it has reached 7 volts and is sampled to provide a pam pulse which
can be peak detected. This sampled output corresponds to the original sampling of the analog voltage in
the modulation.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When the pcm demodulator recognizes the presence or absence of pulses in each position, it
reproduces the correct standard amplitude represented by the pulse code group. For this reason, noise
introduces no error if the largest peaks of noise are not mistaken for pulses. The pcm signal can be
retransmitted as many times as desired without the introduction of additional noise effects so long as the
signal-to-noise ratio is maintained at a level where noise pulses are not mistaken for a signal pulse. This is
not the only method for demodulating pcm, but it is one of the simplest.
