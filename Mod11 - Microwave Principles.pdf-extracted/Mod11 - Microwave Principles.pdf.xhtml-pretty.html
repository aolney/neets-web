SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current

</p><p class="paragraph">Skin effect was discussed in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission 
Lines, and Antennas, Chapter 3. Skin effect tends to increase the effective resistance of the conductor. 
Although energy transfer in coaxial cable is caused by electromagnetic field motion, the magnitude of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">field is limited by the size of the current-carrying area of the inner conductor. The small size of the center 
</p><h3 class="subsection">conductor is even further reduced by skin effect and energy transmission by coaxial cable becomes less 
</h3><p class="paragraph">efficient than by waveguides. DIELECTRIC LOSSES are also lower in waveguides than in two-wire and 
</p><p class="paragraph">coaxial transmission lines. Dielectric losses in two-wire and coaxial lines are caused by the heating of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">insulation between the conductors. The insulation behaves as the dielectric of a capacitor formed by the 
</p><p class="paragraph">two wires of the transmission line. A voltage potential across the two wires causes heating of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">dielectric and results in a power loss. In practical applications, the actual breakdown of the insulation 
</p><p class="paragraph">between the conductors of a transmission line is more frequently a problem than is the dielectric loss. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">This breakdown is usually caused by stationary voltage spikes or "nodes" which are caused by 
</h3><p class="paragraph">standing waves. Standing waves are stationary and occur when part of the energy traveling down the line 
</p><p class="paragraph">is reflected by an impedance mismatch with the load. The voltage potential of the standing waves at the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">points of greatest magnitude can become large enough to break down the insulation between transmission 
</h3><p class="paragraph">line conductors. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The dielectric in waveguides is air, which has a much lower dielectric loss than conventional 
</h3><p class="paragraph">insulating materials. However, waveguides are also subject to dielectric breakdown caused by standing 
</p><p class="paragraph">waves. Standing waves in waveguides cause arcing which decreases the efficiency of energy transfer and 
</p><p class="paragraph">can severely damage the waveguide. Also since the electromagnetic fields are completely contained 
</p><p class="paragraph">within the waveguide, radiation losses are kept very low. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Power-handling capability is another advantage of waveguides. Waveguides can handle more power 
</p><h3 class="subsection">than coaxial lines of the same size because power-handling capability is directly related to the distance

</p><h3 class="subsection">Waveguide Disadvantages 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Physical size is the primary lower-frequency limitation of waveguides. The width of a waveguide 
</p><p class="paragraph">must be approximately a half wavelength at the frequency of the wave to be transported. For example, a 
</p><p class="paragraph">waveguide for use at 1 megahertz would be about 500 feet wide. This makes the use of waveguides at 
</p><p class="paragraph">frequencies below 1000 megahertz increasingly impractical. The lower frequency range of any system 
</p><p class="paragraph">using waveguides is limited by the physical dimensions of the waveguides. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Waveguides are difficult to install because of their rigid, hollow-pipe shape. Special couplings at the 
</p><p class="paragraph">joints are required to assure proper operation. Also, the inside surfaces of waveguides are often plated 
</p><p class="paragraph">with silver or gold to reduce skin effect losses. These requirements increase the costs and decrease the 
</p><p class="paragraph">practicality of waveguide systems at any other than microwave frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-3. Why are coaxial lines more efficient at microwave frequencies than two-wire transmission lines? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-4. What kind of material must be used in the construction of waveguides? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-5. The large surface area of a waveguide greatly reduces what type of loss that is common in 
two-wire and coaxial lines? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-6. What causes the current-carrying area at the center conductor of a coaxial line to be restricted to 
a small layer at the surface? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-7. What is used as a dielectric in waveguides? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-8. What is the primary lower-frequency limitation of waveguides? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Developing the Waveguide from Parallel Lines 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">You may better understand the transition from ordinary transmission line concepts to waveguide 
</h3><p class="paragraph">theories by considering the development of a waveguide from a two-wire transmission line. Figure 1-5 
</p><p class="paragraph">shows a section of two-wire transmission line supported on two insulators. At the junction with the line, 
</p><p class="paragraph">the insulators must present a very high impedance to ground for proper operation of the line. A low 
</p><h3 class="subsection">impedance insulator would obviously short-circuit the line to ground, and this is what happens at very 
</h3><p class="paragraph">high frequencies. Ordinary insulators display the characteristics of the dielectric of a capacitor formed by 
</p><p class="paragraph">the wire and ground. As the frequency increases, the overall impedance decreases. A better high-
</p><p class="paragraph">frequency insulator is a quarter-wave section of transmission line shorted at one end. Such an insulator is 
</p><p class="paragraph">shown in figure 1-6. The impedance of a shorted quarter-wave section is very high at the open-end 
</p><p class="paragraph">junction with the two-wire transmission line. This type of insulator is known as a METALLIC 
</p><p class="paragraph">INSULATOR and may be placed anywhere along a two-wire line. Note that quarter-wave sections are 
</p><p class="paragraph">insulators at only one frequency. This severely limits the bandwidth, efficiency, and application of this 
</p><p class="paragraph">type of two-wire line. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">The standing waves that result from a mismatch cause a power loss, a reduction in power-handling 
</h3><p class="paragraph">capability, and an increase in frequency sensitivity. Impedance-changing devices are therefore placed in

</p><h3 class="subsection">Figure 1-42 illustrates three devices, called irises, that are used to introduce inductance or 
</h3><p class="paragraph">capacitance into a waveguide. An iris is nothing more than a metal plate that contains an opening through 
</p><p class="paragraph">which the waves may pass. The iris is located in the transverse plane. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">An inductive iris and its equivalent circuit are illustrated in figure 1-42, view (A). The iris places a 
</p><p class="paragraph">shunt inductive reactance across the waveguide that is directly proportional to the size of the opening. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that the edges of the inductive iris are perpendicular to the magnetic plane. The shunt capacitive 
</p><p class="paragraph">reactance, illustrated in view (B), basically acts the same way. Again, the reactance is directly 
</p><p class="paragraph">proportional to the size of the opening, but the edges of the iris are perpendicular to the electric plane. The 
</p><h3 class="subsection">iris, illustrated in view (C), has portions across both the magnetic and electric planes and forms an 
</h3><p class="paragraph">equivalent parallel-LC circuit across the waveguide. At the resonant frequency, the iris acts as a high

</p><h3 class="subsection">Waveguide Plumbing 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">Since waveguides are really only hollow metal pipes, the installation and the physical handling of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">waveguides have many similarities to ordinary plumbing. In light of this fact, the bending, twisting, 
</p><p class="paragraph">joining, and installation of waveguides is commonly called waveguide plumbing. Naturally, waveguides 
</p><p class="paragraph">are different in design from pipes that are designed to carry liquids or other substances. The design of a 
</p><p class="paragraph">waveguide is determined by the frequency and power level of the electromagnetic energy it will carry. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The following paragraphs explain the physical factors involved in the design of waveguides. 
</p><p class="paragraph">WAVEGUIDE BENDS.The size, shape, and dielectric material of a waveguide must be constant 
throughout its length for energy to move from one end to the other without reflections. Any abrupt change 
</p><p class="paragraph">in its size or shape can cause reflections and a loss in overall efficiency. When such a change is necessary, 
</p><p class="paragraph">the bends, twists, and joints of the waveguides must meet certain conditions to prevent reflections. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Waveguides may be bent in several ways that do not cause reflections. One way is the gradual bend 
</p><p class="paragraph">shown in figure 1-46. This gradual bend is known as an E bend because it distorts the E fields. The E 
</p><p class="paragraph">bend must have a radius greater than two wavelengths to prevent reflections. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another common bend is the gradual H bend (figure 1-47). It is called an H bend because the H 
</p><p class="paragraph">fields are distorted when a waveguide is bent in this manner. Again, the radius of the bend must be greater 
</p><p class="paragraph">than two wavelengths to prevent reflections. Neither the E bend in the "a" dimension nor the H bend in 
</p><p class="paragraph">the "b" dimension changes the normal mode of operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A sharp bend in either dimension may be used if it meets certain requirements. Notice the two 
</p><p class="paragraph">45-degree bends in figure 1-48; the bends are 1/4! apart. The reflections that occur at the 45-degree bends 
</p><p class="paragraph">cancel each other, leaving the fields as though no reflections have occurred. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">system. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Since a waveguide naturally has a low loss ratio, most losses in a waveguide system are caused by 
</h3><p class="paragraph">other factors. Improperly connected joints or damaged inner surfaces can decrease the efficiency of a 
</p><p class="paragraph">system to the point that it will not work at all. Therefore, you must take great care when working with 
</p><p class="paragraph">waveguides to prevent physical damage. Since waveguides are made from a soft, conductive material, 
</p><p class="paragraph">such as copper or aluminum, they are very easy to dent or deform. Even the slightest damage to the inner

</h3><p class="paragraph">connected either in series or in parallel. The resonant frequency of the circuit is increased by reducing the

</p><p class="paragraph">The upper limit for a conventional resonant circuit is between 2000 and 3000 megahertz. At these 
</p><h3 class="subsection">frequencies, the inductance may consist of a coil of one-half turn, and the capacitance may simply be the

</p><p class="paragraph">even more difficult. In addition, such a circuit will handle only very small amounts of current.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The efficiency of conventional tubes is largely independent of frequency up to a certain limit. When 
frequency increases beyond that limit, several factors combine to rapidly decrease tube efficiency. Tubes 
that are efficient in the microwave range usually operate on the theory of VELOCITY MODULATION, a 
concept that avoids the problems encountered in conventional tubes. Velocity modulation is more easily 
understood if the factors that limit the frequency range of a conventional tube are thoroughly understood. 
Therefore, the frequency limitations of conventional tubes will be discussed before the concepts and 
applications of velocity modulation are explained. You may want to review NEETS, Module 6, 
Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies, Chapters 1 and 2, for a refresher on 
vacuum tubes before proceeding. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Frequency Limitations of Conventional Tubes 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Three characteristics of ordinary vacuum tubes become increasingly important as frequency rises. 
These characteristics are interelectrode capacitance, lead inductance, and electron transit time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The INTERELECTRODE CAPACITANCES in a vacuum tube, at low or medium radio frequencies, 
produce capacitive reactances that are so large that no serious effects upon tube operation are noticeable. 
However, as the frequency increases, the reactances become small enough to materially affect the 
performance of a circuit. For example, in figure 2-1A, a 1-picofarad capacitor has a reactance of 159,000 
ohms at 1 megahertz. If this capacitor was the interelectrode capacitance between the grid and plate of a 
tube, and the rf voltage between these electrodes was 500 volts, then 3.15 milliamperes of current would 
flow through the interelectrode capacitance. Current flow in this small amount would not seriously affect 
circuit performance. On the other hand, at a frequency of 100 megahertz the reactance would decrease to 
approximately 1,590 ohms and, with the same voltage applied, current would increase to 315 
milliamperes (figure 2-1B). Current in this amount would definitely affect circuit performance.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A good point to remember is that the higher the frequency, or the larger the interelectrode 
capacitance, the higher will be the current through this capacitance. The circuit in figure 2-1C, shows the 
interelectrode capacitance between the grid and the cathode (Cgk) in parallel with the signal source. As 
the frequency of the input signal increases, the effective grid-to-cathode impedance of the tube decreases 
because of a decrease in the reactance of the interelectrode capacitance. If the signal frequency is 100 
megahertz or greater, the reactance of the grid-to-cathode capacitance is so small that much of the signal 
is short-circuited within the tube. Since the interelectrode capacitances are effectively in parallel with the 
tuned circuits, as shown in figures 2-1A, B, and C, they will also affect the frequency at which the tuned 
circuits resonate. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another frequency-limiting factor is the LEAD INDUCTANCE of the tube elements. Since the lead 
inductances within a tube are effectively in parallel with the interelectrode capacitance, the net effect is to 
raise the frequency limit. However, the inductance of the cathode lead is common to both the grid and 
plate circuits. This provides a path for degenerative feedback which reduces overall circuit efficiency. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A third limitation caused by tube construction is TRANSIT TIME. Transit time is the time required 
for electrons to travel from the cathode to the plate. While some small amount of transit time is required 
for electrons to travel from the cathode to the plate, the time is insignificant at low frequencies. In fact, 
the transit time is so insignificant at low frequencies that it is generally not considered to be a hindering 
factor. However, at high frequencies, transit time becomes an appreciable portion of a signal cycle and 
begins to hinder efficiency. For example, a transit time of 1 nanosecond, which is not unusual, is only 
0.001 cycle at a frequency of 1 megahertz. The same transit time becomes equal to the time required for 
an entire cycle at 1,000 megahertz. Transit time depends on electrode spacing and existing voltage 
potentials. Transit times in excess of 0.1 cycle cause a significant decrease in tube efficiency. This 
decrease in efficiency is caused, in part, by a phase shift between plate current and grid voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the tube is to operate efficiently, the plate current must be in phase with the grid-signal voltage and 
180 degrees out of phase with the plate voltage. When transit time approaches 1/4 cycle, this phase 
relationship between the elements does not hold true. A positive swing of a high-frequency grid signal 
causes electrons to leave the cathode and flow to the plate. Initially this current is in phase with the grid 
voltage. However, since transit time is an appreciable part of a cycle, the current arriving at the plate now 
lags the grid-signal voltage. As a result, the power output of the tube decreases and the plate power 
dissipation increases. Another loss of power occurs because of ELECTROSTATIC INDUCTION. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The electrons forming the plate current also electrostatically induce potentials in the grid as they 
move past it. This electrostatic induction in the grid causes currents of positive charges to move back and 
forth in the grid structure. This back and forth action is similar to the action of hole current in 
semiconductor devices. When transit-time effect is not a factor (as in low frequencies), the current 
induced in one side of the grid by the approaching electrons is equal to the current induced on the other 
side by the receding electrons. The net effect is zero since the currents are in opposite directions and 
cancel each other. However, when transit time is an appreciable part of a cycle, the number of electrons 
approaching the grid is not always equal to the number going away. As a result, the induced currents do 
not cancel. This uncancelled current produces a power loss in the grid that is considered resistive in 
nature. In other words, the tube acts as if a resistor were connected between the grid and the cathode. The 
resistance of this imaginary resistor decreases rapidly as the frequency increases. The resistance may 
become so low that the grid is essentially short-circuited to the cathode, preventing proper operation of 
the tube. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Several methods are available to reduce the limitations of conventional tubes, but none work well 
when frequency increases beyond 1,000 megahertz. Interelectrode capacitance can be reduced by moving 
the electrodes further apart or by reducing the size of the tube and its electrodes. Moving the electrodes 
apart increases the problems associated with transit time, and reducing the size of the tube lowers the 
power-handling capability. You can see that efforts to reduce certain limitations in conventional tubes are 
compromises that are often in direct opposition to each other. The net effect is an upper limit of 
approximately 1,000 megahertz, beyond which conventional tubes are not practical. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-1. What happens to the impedance of interelectrode capacitance as frequency increases? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-2. What undesirable effect is caused by the inductance of the cathode lead? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-3. How does transit time affect the relationship of the grid voltage and the plate current at high 
frequencies?

effect of what property? </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Velocity Modulation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The microwave tube was developed when the use of the frequency spectrum went beyond 1,000 
megahertz and into the microwave range. The microwave tube uses transit time in the conversion of dc 
power to radio-frequency (rf) power. The interchange of power is accomplished by using the principle of 
electron VELOCITY MODULATION and low-loss resonant cavities in the microwave tube. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A clear understanding of microwave tubes must start with an understanding of how electrons and 
electric fields interact. An electron has mass and thus exhibits kinetic energy when in motion. The amount 
of kinetic energy in an electron is directly proportional to its velocity; that is, the higher the velocity, the 
higher the energy level. The basic concept of the electron energy level being directly related to electron 
velocity is the key principle of energy transfer and amplification in microwave tubes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An electron can be accelerated or decelerated by an electrostatic field. Figure 2-2 shows an electron 
moving in an electrostatic field. The direction of travel (shown by the heavy arrow) is against the 
electrostatic lines of force which are from positive to negative. The negatively charged electron will be 
attracted to the positively charged body and will increase in velocity. As its velocity increases, the energy 
level of the electron will also increase. Where does the electron acquire its additional energy? The only 
logical source is from the electrostatic field. Thus, the conclusion is clear. An electron traveling in a 
direction opposite to electrostatic lines of force will absorb energy and increase in velocity (accelerate). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As figure 2-3 illustrates, the opposite condition is also true. An electron traveling in the same 
direction as the electrostatic lines of force will decelerate by giving up energy to the field. The negatively 
charged body will repel the electron and cause it to decrease in velocity. When the velocity is reduced, the 
energy level is also reduced. The energy lost by the electron is gained by the electrostatic field. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The operation of a velocity-modulated tube depends on a change in the velocity of the electrons 
passing through its electrostatic field. A change in electron velocity causes the tube to produce 
BUNCHES of electrons. These bunches are separated by spaces in which there are relatively few 
electrons. Velocity modulation is then defined as that variation in the velocity of a beam of electrons 
caused by the alternate speeding up and slowing down of the electrons in the beam. This variation is 
usually caused by a voltage signal applied between the grids through which the beam must pass. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The first requirement in obtaining velocity modulation is to produce a stream of electrons which are 
all traveling at the same speed. The electron stream is produced by an electron gun. A simplified version 
of an electron gun is shown in figure 2-4A. Electrons emitted from the cathode are attracted toward the 
positive accelerator grid and all but a few of the electrons pass through the grid and form a beam. The 
electron beam then passes through a pair of closely spaced grids, called BUNCHER GRIDS. Each grid is 
connected to one side of a tuned circuit. The parallel-resonant tuned circuit (figure 2-4A) in the 
illustration represents the doughnut-shaped resonant cavity surrounding the electron stream (figure 2-4B). 
The buncher grids are the dashed lines at the center of the cavity and are at the same dc potential as the 
accelerator grid. The alternating voltage which exists across the resonant circuit causes the velocity of the 
electrons leaving the buncher grids to differ from the velocity of the electrons arriving at the buncher 
grids. The amount of difference depends on the strength and direction of the electrostatic field within the 
resonant cavity as the electrons pass through the grids.

the catcher cavity is determined by the frequency of the buncher-grid signal because this signal 
determines the transit time of the electron bunches. Note also that both cavities are resonant at the 
buncher-grid frequency. The electron bunches will induce an rf voltage in the grid gap of the second 
cavity causing it to oscillate. Proper placement of the second cavity will cause the induced grid-gap 
voltage to decelerate the electron bunches as they arrive at the gap. Since the largest concentration of 
electrons is in the bunches, slowing the bunches causes a transfer of energy to the output cavity. The 
balance of energy has been disturbed because the placement of the catcher cavity is such that bunches are 
slowed down when they arrive at the cavity. The areas between bunches arrive at the cavity at just the 
right time. At this time the voltage is of the correct polarity to increase the velocity of the electrons and 
the beam absorbs energy. The areas between the bunches have very few electrons, so the energy removed 
from the beam is much greater than the energy required to speed up the electrons between the bunches. 
Therefore, if the second cavity is properly positioned, useful energy can be removed from a velocity-
modulated electron beam.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Microwave tubes perform the same functions of generation and amplification in the microwave 
portion of the frequency spectrum that vacuum tubes perform at lower frequencies. This section will 
explain the basic operation of the most widely used microwave tubes, including klystrons, traveling-wave 
tubes, backward-wave oscillators, magnetrons, and crossed-field amplifiers. The variations of these tubes 
for use in specific applications are so numerous that all of them cannot be discussed in this module. 
However, general principles of operation are similar in all of the variations so the explanations will be 
restricted to the general principles of operation. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Basic Two-Cavity Klystron 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Klystrons are velocity-modulated tubes that are used in radar and communications equipment as 
oscillators and amplifiers. Klystrons make use of the transit-time effect by varying the velocity of an 
electron beam in much the same manner as the previously discussed velocity-modulation process. Strong 
electrostatic fields are necessary in the klystron for efficient operation. This is necessary because the 
interaction of the signal and the electron beam takes place in a very short distance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The construction and essential components of a TWO-CAVITY KLYSTRON are shown in figure 
2-7A. Figure 2-7B is a schematic representation of the same tube. When the tube is energized, the cathode 
emits electrons which are focused into a beam by a low positive voltage on the control grid. The beam is 
then accelerated by a very high positive dc potential that is applied in equal amplitude to both the 
accelerator grid and the buncher grids. The buncher grids are connected to a cavity resonator that 
superimposes an ac potential on the dc voltage. Ac potentials are produced by oscillations within the 
cavity that begin spontaneously when the tube is energized. The initial oscillations are caused by random 
fields and circuit imbalances that are present when the circuit is energized. The oscillations within the 
cavity produce an oscillating electrostatic field between the buncher grids that is at the same frequency as 
the natural frequency of the cavity. The direction of the field changes with the frequency of the cavity. 
These changes alternately accelerate and decelerate the electrons of the beam passing through the grids. 
The area beyond the buncher grids is called the DRIFT SPACE. The electrons form bunches in this area 
when the accelerated electrons overtake the decelerated electrons. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

grids are placed along the beam at a point where the bunches are fully formed. The location is determined 
by the transit time of the bunches at the natural resonant frequency of the cavities (the resonant frequency 
of the catcher cavity is the same as the buncher cavity). The location is chosen because maximum energy 
transfer to the output (catcher) cavity occurs when the electrostatic field is of the correct polarity to slow 
down the electron bunches.

</p><h3 class="subsection">The Multicavity Power Klystron 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Klystron amplification, power output, and efficiency can be greatly improved by the addition of 
intermediate cavities between the input and output cavities of the basic klystron. Additional cavities serve 
to velocity-modulate the electron beam and produce an increase in the energy available at the output. 
Since all intermediate cavities in a multicavity klystron operate in the same manner, a representative 
THREE-CAVITY KLYSTRON will be discussed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A three-cavity klystron is illustrated in figure 2-8. The entire DRIFT-TUBE ASSEMBLY, the three 
CAVITIES, and the COLLECTOR PLATE of the three-cavity klystron are operated at ground potential 
for reasons of safety. The electron beam is formed and accelerated toward the drift tube by a large 
negative pulse applied to the cathode. MAGNETIC FOCUS COILS are placed around the drift tube to 
keep the electrons in a tight beam and away from the side walls of the tube. The focus of the beam is also 
aided by the concave shape of the cathode in high-powered klystrons.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The output of any klystron (regardless of the number of cavities used) is developed by velocity 
modulation of the electron beam. The electrons that are accelerated by the cathode pulse are acted upon 
by rf fields developed across the input and middle cavities. Some electrons are accelerated, some are 
decelerated, and some are unaffected. Electron reaction depends on the amplitude and polarity of the 
fields across the cavities when the electrons pass the cavity gaps. During the time the electrons are 
traveling through the drift space between the cavities, the accelerated electrons overtake the decelerated 
electrons to form bunches. As a result, bunches of electrons arrive at the output cavity at the proper 
instant during each cycle of the rf field and deliver energy to the output cavity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Only a small degree of bunching takes place within the electron beam during the interval of travel 
from the input cavity to the middle cavity. The amount of bunching is sufficient, however, to cause 
oscillations within the middle cavity and to maintain a large oscillating voltage across the input gap. Most 
of the velocity modulation produced in the three-cavity klystron is caused by the voltage across the input 
gap of the middle cavity. The high voltage across the gap causes the bunching process to proceed rapidly 
in the drift space between the middle cavity and the output cavity. The electron bunches cross the gap of 
the output cavity when the gap voltage is at maximum negative. Maximum energy transfer from the 
electron beam to the output cavity occurs under these conditions. The energy given up by the electrons is 
the kinetic energy that was originally absorbed from the cathode pulse. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Klystron amplifiers have been built with as many as five intermediate cavities in addition to the input 
and output cavities. The effect of the intermediate cavities is to improve the electron bunching process 
which improves amplifier gain. The overall efficiency of the tube is also improved to a lesser extent. 
Adding more cavities is roughly the same as adding more stages to a conventional amplifier. The overall 
amplifier gain is increased and the overall bandwidth is reduced if all the stages are tuned to the same 
frequency. The same effect occurs with multicavity klystron tuning. A klystron amplifier tube will deliver 
high gain and a narrow bandwidth if all the cavities are tuned to the same frequency. This method of 
tuning is called SYNCHRONOUS TUNING. If the cavities are tuned to slightly different frequencies, the 
gain of the amplifier will be reduced but the bandwidth will be appreciably increased. This method of 
tuning is called STAGGERED TUNING.

and the power output?

</p><h3 class="subsection">The Reflex Klystron 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Another tube based on velocity modulation, and used to generate microwave energy, is the REFLEX 
KLYSTRON (figure 2-9). The reflex klystron contains a REFLECTOR PLATE, referred to as the 
REPELLER, instead of the output cavity used in other types of klystrons. The electron beam is modulated 
as it was in the other types of klystrons by passing it through an oscillating resonant cavity, but here the 
similarity ends. The feedback required to maintain oscillations within the cavity is obtained by reversing 
the beam and sending it back through the cavity. The electrons in the beam are velocity-modulated before 
the beam passes through the cavity the second time and will give up the energy required to maintain </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

This negative element is the repeller mentioned earlier. This type of klystron oscillator is called a reflex 
klystron because of the reflex action of the electron beam. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Three power sources are required for reflex klystron operation: (1) filament power, (2) positive 
resonator voltage (often referred to as beam voltage) used to accelerate the electrons through the grid gap 
of the resonant cavity, and (3) negative repeller voltage used to turn the electron beam around. The 
electrons are focused into a beam by the electrostatic fields set up by the resonator potential (B+) in the 
body of the tube. Note in figure 2-9 that the resonator potential is common to the resonator cavity, the 
accelerating grid, and the entire body of the tube. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The resonator potential also causes the resonant cavity to begin oscillating at its natural frequency 
when the tube is energized. These oscillations cause an electrostatic field across the grid gap of the cavity 
that changes direction at the frequency of the cavity. The changing electrostatic field affects the electrons 
in the beam as they pass through the grid gap. Some are accelerated and some are decelerated, depending 
upon the polarity of the electrostatic field as they pass through the gap. Figure 2-10, view (A), illustrates 
the three possible ways an electron can be affected as it passes through the gap (velocity increasing, 
decreasing, or remaining constant). Since the resonant cavity is oscillating, the grid potential is an 
alternating voltage that causes the electrostatic field between the grids to follow a sine-wave curve as 
shown in figure 2-10, view (B). As a result, the velocity of the electrons passing through the gap is 
affected uniformly as a function of that sine wave. The amount of velocity change is dependent on the 
strength and polarity of the grid voltage. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The variation in grid voltage causes the electrons to enter the space between the grid and the repeller 
at various velocities. For example, in figure 2-10, views (A) and (B), the electrons at times 1 and 2 are 
speeded up as they pass through the grid. At time 3, the field is passing through zero and the electron is 
unaffected. At times 4 and 5, the grid field is reversed; the electrons give up energy because their velocity 
is reduced as they pass through the grids. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The distance the electrons travel in the space separating the grid and the repeller depends upon their 
velocity. Those moving at slower velocities, such as the electron at time 4, move only a short distance 
from the grid before being affected by the repeller voltage. When this happens, the electron is forced by 
the repeller voltage to stop, reverse direction, and return toward the grid. The electrons moving at higher 
velocities travel further beyond the grid before reversing direction because they have greater momentum. 
If the repeller voltage is set at the correct value, the electrons will form a bunch around the constant-speed 
electrons. The electrons will then return to the grid gap at the instant the electrostatic field is at the correct 
polarity to cause maximum deceleration of the bunch. This action is also illustrated in figure 2-10, view 
(A). When the grid field provides maximum deceleration, the returning electrons release maximum 
energy to the grid field which is in phase with cavity current. Thus, the returning electrons supply the 
regenerative feedback required to maintain cavity oscillations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The constant-speed electrons must remain in the reflecting field space for a minimum time of 3/4 
cycle of the grid field for maximum energy transfer. The period of time the electrons remain in the 
repeller field is determined by the amount of negative repeller voltage. The reflex klystron will continue 
to oscillate if the electrons remain in the repeller field longer than 3/4 cycle (as long as the electrons 
return to the grid gap when the field is of the proper polarity to decelerate the electrons). Figure 2-11 
shows the effect of the repeller field on the electron bunch for 3/4 cycle and for 1 3/4 cycles. Although 
not shown in the figure, the constant-velocity electrons may remain in the repeller field for any number of 
cycles over the minimum 3/4 cycle. If the electrons remain in the field for longer than 3/4 cycle, the 
difference in electron transit time causes the tube performance characteristics to change. The differences 
in operating characteristics are identified by MODES OF OPERATION. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The reflex klystron operates in a different mode for each additional cycle that the electrons remain in 
the repeller field. Mode 1 is obtained when the repeller voltage produces an electron transit time of 3/4 
cycle. Additional modes follow in sequence. Mode 2 has an electron transit time of 1 3/4 cycles; mode 3 
has an electron transit time of 2 3/4 cycles; etc. The physical design of the tube limits the number of 
modes possible in practical applications. A range of four modes of operation are normally available. The 
actual mode used (1 3/4 cycles through 4 3/4 cycles, 2 3/4 cycles through 6 3/4 cycles, etc.) depends upon 
the application. The choice of mode is determined by the difference in power available from each mode 
and the band of frequencies over which the circuit can be tuned. 
</p><p class="paragraph">OUTPUT POWER.—The variation in output power for different modes of operation can be 
explained by examining the factors which limit the amplitude of oscillations. Power and amplitude 
limitations are caused by the DEBUNCHING process of the electrons in the repeller field space. 
Debunching is simply the spreading out of the electron bunches before they reach electrostatic fields 
across the cavity grid . The lower concentration of electrons in the returning bunches provides less power 
for delivery to the oscillating cavity. This reduced power from the bunches, in turn, reduces the amplitude 
of the cavity oscillations and causes a decrease in output power. In higher modes of operation the electron 
bunches are formed more slowly. They are more likely to be affected by debunching because of mutual 
repulsion between the negatively charged electrons. The long drift time in the higher modes allows more 
time for this electron interaction and, as a result, the effects of debunching are more severe. The mutual 
repulsion changes the relative velocity between the electrons in the bunches and causes the bunches to 
spread out. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">The Decibel Measurement System 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Because of the use of the decibel measurement system in the following paragraphs, you will be 
introduced to it at this point. Technicians who deal with communications and radar equipment most often 
speak of the gain of an amplifier or a system in terms of units called DECIBELS (dB). Throughout your 
Navy career you will use decibels as an indicator of equipment performance; therefore, you need to have 
a basic understanding of the decibel system of measurement. Because the actual calculation of decibel 
measurements is seldom required in practical applications, the explanation given in this module is 
somewhat simplified. Most modern test equipment is designed to measure and indicate decibels directly 
which eliminates the need for complicated mathematical calculations. Nevertheless, a basic explanation of 
the decibel measurement system is necessary for you to understand the significance of dB readings and 
equipment gain ratings which are expressed in decibels. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic unit of measurement in the system is not the decibel, but the bel, named in honor of the 
American inventor, Alexander Graham Bell. The bel is a unit that expresses the logarithmic ratio between 
the input and output of any given component, circuit, or system and may be expressed in terms of voltage, 
current, or power. Most often it is used to show the ratio between input and output power. The formula is 
as follows: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The gain of an amplifier can be expressed in bels by dividing the output (P1) by the input (P2) and 
taking the base 10 logarithm of the resulting quotient. Thus, if an amplifier doubles the power, the 
quotient will be 2. If you consult a logarithm table, you will find that the base 10 logarithm of 2 is 0.3; so 
the power gain of the amplifier is 0.3 bel. Experience has taught that because the bel is a rather large unit, 
it is difficult to apply. A more practical unit that can be applied more easily is the decibel (1/10 bel). Any 
figure expressed in bels can easily be converted to decibels by multiplying the figure by 10 or simply by 
moving the decimal one place to the right. The previously found ratio of 0.3 is therefore equal to 3 
decibels. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The reason for using the decibel system when expressing signal strength may be seen in the power 
ratios in table 2-1. For example, to say that a reference signal has increased 50 dB is much easier than to 
say the output has increased 100,000 times. The amount of increase or decrease from a chosen reference 
level is the basis of the decibel measurement system, not the reference level itself. Whether the input 
power is increased from 1 watt to 100 watts or from 1,000 watts to 100,000 watts, the amount of increase 
is still 20 decibels.

</p><p class="paragraph">Examine table 2-1 again, and take particular note of the power ratios for source levels of 3 dB and 6 
dB. As the table illustrates, an increase of 3 dB represents a doubling of power. The reverse is also true. If 
a signal decreases by 3 dB, half the power is lost. For example, a 1,000 watt signal decreased by 3 dB will 
equal 500 watts while a 1,000 watt signal increased by 3 dB equals 2,000 watts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The attenuator is a widely used piece of test equipment that can be used to demonstrate the 
importance of the decibel as a unit of measurement. Attenuators are used to reduce a signal to a smaller 
level for use or measurement. Most attenuators are rated by the number of decibels the signal is reduced. 
The technician's job is to know the relationship between the dB rating and the power reduction it 
represents. This is so important, in fact, that every student of electronics should memorize the 
relationships in table 2-1 through the 60 dB range. The technician will have to apply this knowledge to 
prevent damage to valuable equipment. A helpful hint is to note that the first digit of the source level (on 
the chart) is the same number as the corresponding power of 10 exponent; i.e., 40 dB = 1 × 104 or 10,000. 
A 20 dB attenuator, for example, will reduce an input signal by a factor of 100. In other words, a 100-
milliwatt signal will be reduced to 1 milliwatt. A 30 dB attenuator will reduce the same 100-milliwatt 
signal by a factor of 1,000 and produce an output of 0.1 milliwatt. When an attenuator of the required size 
is not available, attenuators of several smaller sizes may be added directly together to reach the desired 
amount of attenuation. A 10 dB attenuator and a 20 dB attenuator add directly to equal 30 dB of 
attenuation. The same relationship exists with amplifier stages as well. If an amplifier has two stages rated 
at 10 dB each, the total amplifier gain will be 20 dB. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When you speak of the dB level of a signal, you are really speaking of a logarithmic comparison 
between the input and output signals. The input signal is normally used as the reference level. However, 
the application sometimes requires the use of a standard reference signal. The most widely used reference 
level is a 1-milliwatt signal. The standard decibel abbreviation of dB is changed to dBm to indicate the 
use of the 1-milliwatt standard reference. Thus, a signal level of +3 dBm is 3 dB above 1 milliwatt, and a 
signal level of −3 dBm is 3 dB below 1 milliwatt. Whether using dB or dBm, a plus (+) sign (or no sign at 
all) indicates the output signal is larger than the reference; a minus (−) sign indicates the output signal is 
less than the reference. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The Navy student of electronics will encounter the dBm system of measurement most often as a 
figure indicating the receiver sensitivity of radar or communications equipment. Typically, a radar 
receiver will be rated at approximately −107 dBm, which means the receiver will detect a signal 107 dB 
below 1 milliwatt. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The importance of understanding the decibel system of measurement can easily be seen in the case 
of receiver-sensitivity measurements. At first glance a loss of 3 dBm from a number as large as −107 
dBm seems insignificant; however, it becomes extremely important when the number indicates receiver 
sensitivity in the decibel system. When the sensitivity falls to −104 dBm, the receiver will only detect a 
signal that is twice as large as a signal at −107 dBm. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Traveling-Wave Tube 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The TRAVELING-WAVE TUBE (twt) is a high-gain, low-noise, wide-bandwidth microwave 
amplifier. It is capable of gains greater than 40 dB with bandwidths exceeding an octave. (A bandwidth of 
1 octave is one in which the upper frequency is twice the lower frequency.) Traveling-wave tubes have 
been designed for frequencies as low as 300 megahertz and as high as 50 gigahertz. The twt is primarily a 
voltage amplifier. The wide-bandwidth and low-noise characteristics make the twt ideal for use as an rf 
amplifier in microwave equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The physical construction of a typical twt is shown in figure 2-13. The twt contains an electron gun 
which produces and then accelerates an electron beam along the axis of the tube. The surrounding magnet 
provides a magnetic field along the axis of the tube to focus the electrons into a tight beam. The HELIX, 
at the center of the tube, is a coiled wire that provides a low-impedance transmission line for the rf energy 
within the tube. The rf input and output are coupled onto and removed from the helix by directional 
couplers that have no physical connection to the helix. If the rf energy is transported on coaxial cables, the 
coaxial couplers are wound in a helical manner similar to that shown in figure 2-13. If the rf energy is 
transported in waveguides, waveguide directional couplers are used. The attenuator prevents any reflected 
waves from traveling back down the helix. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

electromagnetic waves traveling down the line produce electric fields that interact with the electrons of 
the beam. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the electrons of the beam were accelerated to travel faster than the waves traveling on the wire, 
bunching would occur through the effect of velocity modulation. Velocity modulation would be caused 
by the interaction between the traveling-wave fields and the electron beam. Bunching would cause the 
electrons to give up energy to the traveling wave if the fields were of the correct polarity to slow down the 
bunches. The energy from the bunches would increase the amplitude of the traveling wave in a 
progressive action that would take place all along the length of the twt, as shown in figure 2-14. 
</p><p class="paragraph">However, because the waves travel along the wire at the speed of light, the simple twt shown in 
figure 2-14 will not work. At present no way is known to accelerate an electron beam to the speed of 
light. Since the electron beam cannot travel faster than the wave on the wire, bunching will not take place 
and the tube will not work. The twt is therefore designed with a delay structure to slow the traveling wave 
down to or below the speed of the electrons in the beam. A common twt delay structure is a wire, wound 
in the form of a long coil or helix, as shown in figure 2-15, view (A). The shape of the helix slows the 
effective velocity of the wave along the common axis of the helix and the tube to about one-tenth the 
speed of light. The wave still travels down the helix wire at the speed of light, but the coiled shape causes 
the wave to travel a much greater total distance than the electron beam. The speed at which the wave 
travels down the tube can be varied by changing the number of turns or the diameter of the turns in the 
helix wire. The helical delay structure works well because it has the added advantage of causing a large 
proportion of electric fields that are parallel to the electron beam. The parallel fields provide maximum 
interaction between the fields and the electron beam. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In a typical twt, the electron beam is directed down the center of the helix while, at the same time, an 
rf signal is coupled onto the helix. The electrons of the beam are velocity-modulated by the electric fields 
produced by the rf signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Amplification begins as the electron bunches form and release energy to the signal on the helix. The 
slightly amplified signal causes a denser electron bunch which, in turn, amplifies the signal even more. 
The amplification process is continuous as the rf wave and the electron beam travel down the length of 
the tube. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Any portion of the twt output signal that reflects back to the input will cause oscillations within the 
tube which results in a decrease in amplification. Attenuators are placed along the length of the helix to 
prevent reflections from reaching the input. The attenuator causes a loss in amplitude, as can be seen in 
figure 2-15, view (B), but it can be placed so as to minimize losses while still isolating the input from the 
output. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The relatively low efficiency of the twt partially offsets the advantages of high gain and wide 
bandwidth. The internal attenuator reduces the gain of the tube, and the power required to energize the 
focusing magnet is an operational loss that cannot be recovered. The twt also produces heat which must 
be dissipated by either air-conditioning or liquid-cooling systems. All of these factors reduce the overall 
efficiency of the twt, but the advantages of high gain and wide bandwidth are usually enough to overcome 
the disadvantages.

similar to the actions in a twt. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The typical bwo is constructed from a folded transmission line or waveguide that winds back and 
forth across the path of the electron beam, as shown in figure 2-16. The folded waveguide in the 
illustration serves the same purpose as the helix in a twt. The fixed spacing of the folded waveguide limits 
the bandwidth of the bwo. Since the frequency of a given waveguide is constant, the frequency of the bwo 
is controlled by the transit time of the electron beam. The transit time is controlled by the collector 
potential. Thus, the output frequency can be changed by varying the collector voltage, which is a definite 
advantage. As in the twt, the electron beam in the bwo is focused by a magnet placed around the body of 
the tube.

the central portion of the tube dividing the inner structure into as many segments as there are cavities. 
Alternate segments are strapped together to put the cavities in parallel with regard to the output. The

the block at the entrance slots to the cavities. Since the cathode must operate at high power, it must be 
fairly large and must also be able to withstand high operating temperatures. It must also have good 
emission characteristics, particularly under return bombardment by the electrons. This is because most of 
the output power is provided by the large number of electrons that are emitted when high-velocity 
electrons return to strike the cathode. The cathode is indirectly heated and is constructed of a high-

slightly higher than the critical value. In the split-anode tube, the critical value is the field value required 
to cause all the electrons to miss the plate when its halves are operating at the same potential. The 
alternating voltages impressed on the plates by the oscillations generated in the tank circuit will cause 
electron motion, such as that shown in figure 2-24, and current will flow. Since a very concentrated 
magnetic field is required for the negative-resistance magnetron oscillator, the length of the tube plate is 
limited to a few centimeters to keep the magnet at reasonable dimensions. In addition, a small diameter 
tube is required to make the magnetron operate efficiently at microwave frequencies. A heavy-walled 
plate is used to increase the radiating properties of the tube. Artificial cooling methods, such as forced-air 
or water-cooled systems, are used to obtain still greater dissipation in these high-output tubes. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The output of a magnetron is reduced by the bombardment of the filament by electrons which travel 
in loops, shown in figure 2-22, views (B) and (C). This action causes an increase of filament temperature 
under conditions of a strong magnetic field and high plate voltage and sometimes results in unstable 
operation of the tube. The effects of filament bombardment can be reduced by operating the filament at a 
reduced voltage. In some cases, the plate voltage and field strength are also reduced to prevent destructive 
filament bombardment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">ELECTRON-RESONANCE MAGNETRON.—In the electron-resonance magnetron, the plate is 
constructed to resonate and function as a tank circuit. Thus, the magnetron has no external tuned circuits. 
Power is delivered directly from the tube through transmission lines, as shown in figure 2-25. The 
constants and operating conditions of the tube are such that the electron paths are somewhat different 
from those in figure 2-24. Instead of closed spirals or loops, the path is a curve having a series of sharp 
points, as illustrated in figure 2-26. Ordinarily, this type of magnetron has more than two segments in the 
plate. For example, figure 2-26 illustrates an eight-segment plate.

</p><p class="paragraph">Electric Field.—The electric field in the electron-resonance oscillator is a product of ac and dc 
fields. The dc field extends radially from adjacent anode segments to the cathode, as shown in figure 2-
32. The ac fields, extending between adjacent segments, are shown at an instant of maximum magnitude 
of one alternation of the rf oscillations occurring in the cavities. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The strong dc field going from anode to cathode is created by a large, negative dc voltage pulse 
applied to the cathode. This strong dc field causes electrons to accelerate toward the plate after they have 
been emitted from the cathode. Recall that an electron moving against an E field is accelerated by the 
field and takes energy from the field. Also, an electron gives up energy to a field and slows down if it is 
moving in the same direction as the field (positive to negative). Oscillations are sustained in a magnetron 
because as electrons pass through the ac and dc fields, they gain energy from the dc field and give up 
energy to the ac field. The electrons that give up energy to the ac field are called WORKING 
ELECTRONS. However, not all of the electrons give up energy to the ac field. Some electrons take 
energy from the ac field, which is an undesirable action. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 2-32, consider electron Q1, which is shown entering the field around the slot entrance to 
cavity A. The clockwise rotation of the electron path is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field 
around the moving electron with the permanent magnetic field. The permanent magnetic field is assumed 
to be going into the paper in figure 2-32 (the action of an electron moving in an H field was explained </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">earlier). Notice that electron Q1 is moving against the ac field around cavity A. The electron takes energy 
from the ac field and then accelerates, turning more sharply when its velocity increases. Thus, electron Q1 
turns back toward the cathode. When it strikes the cathode, it gives up the energy it received from the ac 
field. This bombardment also forces more electrons to leave the cathode and accelerate toward the anode. 
Electron Q2 is slowed down by the field around cavity B and gives up some of its energy to the ac field. 
Since electron Q2 loses velocity, the deflective force exerted by the H field is reduced. The electron path 
then deviates to the left in the direction of the anode, rather than returning to the cathode as did electron 
Q1. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The cathode to anode potential and the magnetic field strength determine the amount of time for 
electron Q2 to travel from a position in front of cavity B to a position in front of cavity C. Cavity C is 
equal to approximately 1/2 cycle of the rf oscillations of the cavities. When electron Q2 reaches a position 
in front of cavity C, the ac field of cavity C is reversed from that shown. Therefore, electron Q2 gives up 
energy to the ac field of cavity C and slows down even more. Electron Q2 actually gives up energy to 
each cavity as it passes and eventually reaches the anode when its energy is expended. Thus, electron Q2 
has helped sustain oscillations because it has taken energy from the dc field and given it to the ac field. 
Electron Q1, which took energy from the ac field around cavity A, did little harm because it immediately 
returned to the cathode. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The cumulative action of many electrons returning to the cathode while others are moving toward the 
anode forms a pattern resembling the moving spokes of a wheel known as a SPACE-CHARGE WHEEL, 
as indicated in figure 2-33. Electrons in the spokes of the wheel are the working electrons. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The space-charge wheel rotates about the cathode at an angular velocity of 2 poles (anode segments) 
per cycle of the ac field. This phase relationship enables the concentration of electrons to continuously 
deliver energy to sustain the rf oscillations. Electrons emitted from the area of the cathode between the 
spokes are quickly returned to the cathode. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 2-33 the alternate segments between cavities are assumed to be at the same potential at the 
same instant. An ac field is assumed to exist across each individual cavity. This mode of operation is 
called the PI MODE, since adjacent segments of the anode have a phase difference of 180 degrees, or 
one-pi radian. Several other modes of oscillation are possible, but a magnetron operating in the pi mode 
has greater power and output and is the most commonly used.

the resonant cavities. In figure 2-36, an inductive tuning element is inserted into the hole portion of the

area to cavity volume in a high-current region. The type of tuner illustrated in figure 2-36 is called a 
SPROCKET TUNER or CROWN-OF-THORNS TUNER. All of its tuning elements are attached to a 
frame which is positioned by a flexible bellows arrangement. The insertion of the tuning elements into 
each anode hole decreases the inductance of the cavity and therefore increases the resonant frequency. 
One of the limitations of inductive tuning is that it lowers the unloaded Q of the cavities and therefore

low-power outputs. The type of capacitive tuner illustrated in figure 2-37 is called a COOKIE-CUTTER 
TUNER. It consists of a metal ring inserted between the two rings of a double-strapped magnetron, which 
serves to increase the strap capacitance. Because of the mechanical and voltage breakdown problems 
associated with the cookie-cutter tuner, it is more suitable for use at longer wavelengths. Both the

</p><p class="paragraph">ARCING IN MAGNETRONS.—During initial operation a high-powered magnetron arcs from 
cathode to plate and must be properly BROKEN IN or BAKED IN. Actually, arcing in magnetrons is 
very common. It occurs with a new tube or following long periods of idleness. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the prime causes of arcing is the release of gas from tube elements during idle periods. 
Arcing may also be caused by the presence of sharp surfaces within the tube, mode shifting, and by 
drawing excessive current. While the cathode can withstand considerable arcing for short periods of time, 
continued arcing will shorten the life of the magnetron and may destroy it entirely. Therefore, each time 
excessive arcing occurs, the tube must be baked in again until the arcing ceases and the tube is stabilized. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The baking-in procedure is relatively simple. Magnetron voltage is raised from a low value until 
arcing occurs several times a second. The voltage is left at that value until arcing dies out. Then the 
voltage is raised further until arcing again occurs and is left at that value until the arcing again ceases. 
Whenever the arcing becomes very violent and resembles a continuous arc, the applied voltage is 
excessive and should be reduced to permit the magnetron to recover. When normal rated voltage is 
reached and the magnetron remains stable at the rated current, the baking-in is complete. A good 
maintenance practice is to bake-in magnetrons left idle in the equipment or those used as spares when 
long periods of nonoperating time have accumulated. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The preceding information is general in nature. The recommended times and procedures in the 
technical manuals for the equipment should be followed when baking-in a specific type magnetron. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Crossed-Field Amplifier (Amplitron) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The CROSSED-FIELD AMPLIFIER (cfa), commonly known as an AMPLITRON and sometimes 
referred to as a PLATINOTRON, is a broadband microwave amplifier that can also be used as an 
oscillator. The cfa is similar in operation to the magnetron and is capable of providing relatively large 
amounts of power with high efficiency. The bandwidth of the cfa, at any given instant, is approximately 
plus or minus 5 percent of the rated center frequency. Any incoming signals within this bandwidth are 
amplified. Peak power levels of many megawatts and average power levels of tens of kilowatts average 
are, with efficiency ratings in excess of 70 percent, possible with crossed-field amplifiers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of the desirable characteristics of wide bandwidth, high efficiency, and the ability to handle 
large amounts of power, the cfa is used in many applications in microwave electronic systems. This high 
efficiency has made the cfa useful for space-telemetry applications, and the high power and stability have 
made it useful in high-energy, linear atomic accelerators. When used as the intermediate or final stage in 
high-power radar systems, all of the advantages of the cfa are used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the cfa operates in a manner so similar to the magnetron, the detailed theory is not presented in 
this module. Detailed information of cfa operation is available in NAVSHIPS 0967-443-2230, Handling, 
Installation and Operation of Crossed-Field Amplifiers. As mentioned earlier, crossed-field amplifiers are 
commonly called Amplitrons. You should note, however, that Amplitron is a trademark of the Raytheon

</h2><p class="paragraph">As with vacuum tubes, the special electronics effects encountered at microwave frequencies severely 
limit the usefulness of transistors in most circuit applications. The need for small-sized microwave 
devices has caused extensive research in this area. This research has produced solid-state devices with 
higher and higher frequency ranges. The new solid-state microwave devices are predominantly active, 
two-terminal diodes, such as tunnel diodes, varactors, transferred-electron devices, and avalanche transit-
time diodes. This section will describe the basic theory of operation and some of the applications of these 
relatively new solid-state devices. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tunnel Diode Devices 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The TUNNEL DIODE is a pn junction with a very high concentration of impurities in both the p and 
n regions. The high concentration of impurities causes it to exhibit the properties of a negative-resistance 
element over part of its range of operation, as shown in the characteristic curve in figure 2-39. In other 
words, the resistance to current flow through the tunnel diode increases as the applied voltage increases 
over a portion of its region of operation. Outside the negative-resistance region, the tunnel diode functions 
essentially the same as a normal diode. However, the very high impurity density causes a junction 
depletion region so narrow that both holes and electrons can transfer across the pn junction by a quantum </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

that no transit-time effects occur even at microwave frequencies. The lack of a transit-time effect permits 
the use of tunnel diodes in a wide variety of microwave circuits, such as amplifiers, oscillators, and 
switching devices. The detailed theory of tunnel-diode operation and the negative-resistance property 
exhibited by the tunnel diode was discussed in NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices and 
Power Supplies, Chapter 3.

resistance range (point B in figure 2-39) and coupled to a tuned circuit or cavity, produces a very stable 
oscillator. The oscillation frequency is the same as the tuned circuit or cavity frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Microwave tunnel-diode oscillators are useful in applications that require microwatts or, at most, a 
few milliwatts of power, such as local oscillators for microwave superheterodyne receivers. Tunnel-diode 
oscillators can be mechanically or electronically tuned over frequency ranges of about one octave and 
have a top-end frequency limit of approximately 10 gigahertz. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Tunnel-diode oscillators that are designed to operate at microwave frequencies generally use some 
form of transmission line as a tuned circuit. Suitable tuned circuits can be built from coaxial lines, 
transmission lines, and waveguides. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An example of a highly stable tunnel-diode oscillator is shown in figure 2-40. A tunnel-diode is 
loosely coupled to a high-Q tunable cavity. Loose coupling is achieved by using a short, antenna feed 
probe placed off-center in the cavity. Loose coupling is used to increase the stability of the oscillations 
and the output power over a wider bandwidth. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The output power produced is in the range of a few hundred microwatts, sufficient for many 
microwave applications. The frequency at which the oscillator operates is determined by the physical 
positioning of the tuner screw in the cavity. Changing the output frequency by this method is called 
MECHANICAL TUNING. In addition to mechanical tuning, tunnel-diode oscillators may be tuned 
electronically. One method is called BIAS TUNING and involves nothing more than changing the bias 
voltage to change the bias point on the characteristic curve of the tunnel-diode. Another method is called 
VARACTOR TUNING and requires the addition of a varactor to the basic circuit. Varactors were 
discussed in NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices, and Power Supplies, Chapter 3. 
Tuning is achieved by changing the voltage applied across the varactor which alters the capacitance of the 
tuned circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">TUNNEL-DIODE AMPLIFIERS.—Low-noise, tunnel-diode amplifiers represent an important 
microwave application of tunnel diodes. Tunnel-diode amplifiers with frequencies up to 85 gigahertz have 
been built in waveguides, coaxial lines, and transmission lines. The low-noise generation, gain ratios of 
up to 30 dB, high reliability, and light weight make these amplifiers ideal for use as the first stage of 
amplification in communications and radar receivers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most microwave tunnel-diode amplifiers are REFLECTION-TYPE, CIRCULATOR-COUPLED 
AMPLIFIERS. As in oscillators, the tunnel diode is biased to the center point of its negative-resistance 
region, but a CIRCULATOR replaces the tuned cavity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A circulator is a waveguide device that allows energy to travel in one direction only, as shown in 
figure 2-41. The tunnel diode in figure 2-41 is connected across a tuned-input circuit. This arrangement 
normally produces feedback that causes oscillations if the feedback is allowed to reflect back to the tuned-
input circuit. The feedback is prevented because the circulator carries all excess energy to the absorptive 
load (R L). In this configuration the tunnel diode cannot oscillate, but will amplify. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

filter serves a dual purpose as a bandwidth selector and an impedance-matching device that improves the 
gain of the amplifiers. The input energy enters port 2 of the circulator and is amplified by the tunnel 
diode. The amplified energy is fed from port 2 to port 3 and on to the mixer. If any energy is reflected 
from port 3, it is passed to port 4, where it is absorbed by the matched load resistance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">TUNNEL-DIODE FREQUENCY CONVERTERS AND MIXERS.—Tunnel diodes make 
excellent mixers and frequency converters because their current-voltage characteristics are highly 
nonlinear. While other types of frequency converters usually have a conversion power loss, tunnel-diode 
converters can actually have a conversion power gain. A single tunnel diode can also be designed to act as 
both the nonlinear element in a converter and as the negative-resistance element in a local oscillator at the 
same time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Practical tunnel-diode frequency converters usually have either a unity conversion gain or a small 
conversion loss. Conversion gains as high as 20 dB are possible if the tunnel diode is biased near or into 
the negative-resistance region. Although high gain is useful in some applications, it presents problems in 
stability. For example, the greatly increased sensitivity to variations in input impedance can cause high-
gain converters to be unstable unless they are protected by isolation circuitry. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As with tunnel-diode amplifiers, low-noise generation is one of the more attractive characteristics of 
tunnel-diode frequency converters. Low-noise generation is a primary concern in the design of today's 
extremely sensitive communications and radar receivers. This is one reason tunnel-diode circuits are

</p><h3 class="subsection">Varactor Devices 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The VARACTOR is another of the active two-terminal diodes that operates in the microwave range. 
Since the basic theory of varactor operation was presented in NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-
State Devices and Power Supplies, Chapter 3, only a brief review of the basic principles is presented here. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The varactor is a semiconductor diode with the properties of a voltage-dependent capacitor. 
Specifically, it is a variable-capacitance, pn-junction diode that makes good use of the voltage 
dependency of the depletion-area capacitance of the diode. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 2-42A, two materials are brought together to form a pn-junction diode. The different energy 
levels in the two materials cause a diffusion of the holes and electrons through both materials which tends 
to balance their energy levels. When this diffusion process stops, the diode is left with a small area on 
either side of the junction, called the depletion area, which contains no free electrons or holes. The 
movement of electrons through the materials creates an electric field across the depletion area that is 
described as a barrier potential and has the electrical characteristics of a charged capacitor. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">External bias, applied in either the forward or reverse direction, as shown in figure 2-42B and C, 
affects the magnitude, barrier potential, and width of the depletion area. Enough forward or reverse bias 
will overcome the barrier potential and cause current to flow through the diode. The width of the 
depletion region can be controlled by keeping the bias voltage at levels that do not allow current flow. 
Since the depletion area acts as a capacitor, the diode will perform as a variable capacitor that changes 
with the applied bias voltage. The capacitance of a typical varactor can vary from 2 to 50 picofarads for a 
bias variation of just 2 volts.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The variable capacitance property of the varactor allows it to be used in circuit applications, such as 
amplifiers, that produce much lower internal noise levels than circuits that depend upon resistance 
properties. Since noise is of primary concern in receivers, circuits using varactors are an important 
development in the field of low-noise amplification. The most significant use of varactors to date has 
been as the basic component in parametric amplifiers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">PARAMETRIC AMPLIFIERS.—The parametric amplifier is named for the time-varying 
parameter, or value of capacitance, associated with the operation. Since the underlying principle of 
operation is based on reactance, the parametric amplifier is sometimes called a REACTANCE 
AMPLIFIER. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The conventional amplifier is essentially a variable resistance that uses energy from a dc source to 
increase ac energy. The parametric amplifier uses a nonlinear variable reactance to supply energy from an 
ac source to a load. Since reactance does not add thermal noise to a circuit, parametric amplifiers produce 
much less noise than most conventional amplifiers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because the most important feature of the parametric amplifier is the low-noise characteristic, the 
nature of ELECTRONIC NOISE and the effect of this type of noise on receiver operation must first be 
discussed. Electronic noise is the primary limitation on receiver sensitivity and is the name given to very 
small randomly fluctuating voltages that are always present in electronic circuits. The sensitivity limit of 
the receiver is reached when the incoming signal falls below the level of the noise generated by the 
receiver circuits. At this point the incoming signal is hidden by the noise, and further amplification has no 
effect because the noise is amplified at the same rate as the signal. The effects of noise can be reduced by 
careful circuit design and control of operating conditions, but it cannot be entirely eliminated. Therefore, 
circuits such as the parametric amplifier are important developments in the fields of communication and 
radar. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic theory of parametric amplification centers around a capacitance that varies with time. 
Consider the simple series circuit shown in figure 2-43. When the switch is closed, the capacitor charges 
to value (Q). If the switch is opened, the isolated capacitor has a voltage across the plates determined by 
the charge Q divided by the capacitance C.

</p><p class="paragraph">An increase in the charge Q or a decrease in the capacitance C causes an increase in the voltage 
across the plates. Thus, a voltage increase, or amplification, can be obtained by mechanically or 
electronically varying the amount of capacitance in the circuit. In practice a voltage-variable capacitance, 
such as a varactor, is used. The energy required to vary the capacitance is obtained from an electrical 
source called a PUMP. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-44, view (A), shows a circuit application using a voltage-variable capacitor and a pump 
circuit. The pump circuit decreases the capacitance each time the input signal (E) across the capacitor 
reaches maximum. The decreased capacitance causes a voltage buildup as shown by the dotted line in 
view (B). Therefore, each time the pump decreases capacitance (view (C)), energy transfers from the 
pump circuit to the input signal. The step-by-step buildup of the input-signal energy level is shown in 
view (D).

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Proper phasing between the pump and the input signal is crucial in this circuit. The electrical pump 
action is simply a sine-wave voltage applied to a varactor located in a resonant cavity. For proper 
operation, the capacitance must be decreased when the input voltage is maximum and increased when the 
input voltage is minimum. In other words, the pump signal frequency must be exactly double the 
frequency of the input signal. This relationship can be seen when you compare views (B) and (C). A 
parametric amplifier of the type shown in figure 2-44 is quite phase-sensitive. The input signal and the 
capacitor variation are often in the wrong phase for long periods of time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A parametric amplifier that is not phase-sensitive, referred to as a NONDEGENERATIVE 
PARAMETRIC AMPLIFIER, uses a pump circuit with a frequency higher than twice the input signal. 
The higher-frequency pump signal mixes with the input signal and produces additional frequencies that 
represent both the sum and difference of the input signal and pump frequencies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-45A, is a diagram of a typical nondegenerative parametric amplifier with the equivalent 
circuit shown in figure 2-45B. The pump signal (fp) is applied to the varactor. The cavity on the left is 
resonant at the input frequency (fs), and the cavity on the right is resonant at the difference frequency 
(fp-fs). The difference frequency is called the IDLER- or LOWER-SIDEBAND frequency. The varactor 
is located at the high-voltage points of the two cavities and is reverse biased by a small battery. The pump 
signal varies the bias above and below the fixed-bias level.

</p><p class="paragraph">The pump signal causes the capacitor in figure 2-45A to vary at a 12-gigahertz rate. The 3-gigahertz 
input signal enters via a four-port ferrite circulator, is developed in the signal cavity, and applied across 
the varactor. The nonlinear action of the varactor produces a 9-gigahertz difference frequency (fp-fs) with 
an energy-level higher than the original input signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The difference (idler) frequency is reapplied to the varactor to increase the gain and to produce an 
output signal of the correct frequency. The 9-gigahertz idler frequency recombines with the 12-gigahertz 
pump signal and produces a 3-gigahertz difference signal that has a much larger amplitude than the 
original 3-gigahertz input signal. The amplified signal is sent to the ferrite circulator for transfer to the 
next stage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As with tunnel-diode amplifiers, the circulator improves stability by preventing reflection of the 
signal back into the amplifier. Reflections would be amplified and cause uncontrollable oscillations. The 
ferrite circulator also serves as an isolator to prevent source and load impedance changes from affecting 
gain. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Typically, the gain of a parametric amplifier is about 20 dB. The gain can be controlled with a 
variable attenuator that changes the amount of pump power applied to the varactor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Parametric amplifiers are relatively simple in construction. The only component is a varactor diode 
placed in an arrangement of cavities and waveguides. The most elaborate feature of the amplifier is the 
mechanical tuning mechanism. Figure 2-46 illustrates an actual parametric amplifier.

LOWER-SIDEBAND PARAMETRIC DOWN-CONVERTER produces an output frequency that is the 
DIFFERENCE between the pump frequency and the input frequency. The DOUBLE-SIDEBAND 
PARAMETRIC UP-CONVERTER produces an output in which both the SUM and the DIFFERENCE of 
the pump and input frequencies are available. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Parametric frequency converters are very similar to parametric amplifiers in both construction and 
operation. Figure 2-47 is a functional diagram of a parametric down-converter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The parametric frequency converter operates in the same manner as the parametric amplifier except 
that the sideband frequencies are not reapplied to the varactor. Therefore, the output is one or both of the 
sideband frequencies and is not the same as the input frequency. The output frequency is determined by 
the cavity used as an output. For example, the idler cavity in figure 2-47 could be replaced by a cavity that 
is resonant at the upper-sideband frequency (22 gigahertz) to produce an upper-sideband parametric 
up-converter. Since input and output signals are at different frequencies, the parametric frequency 
converter does not require a ferrite circulator. However, a ferrite isolator is used to isolate the converter

and operation. Some types have no junctions and the processes necessary for operation occur in a solid 
block of semiconductor material. Other types have more than one junction but still use bulk-effect action. 
Bulk-effect devices are among the latest of developments in the field of microwave semiconductors and 
new applications are being developed rapidly. They seem destined to revolutionize the field of high-
power, solid-state microwave generation because they can produce much larger microwave power outputs 
than any currently available pn-junction semiconductors. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Bulk-effect semiconductors are of two basic types: the transferred-electron devices and the 
avalanche transit-time devices. 
</p><p class="paragraph">TRANSFERRED-ELECTRON SEMICONDUCTORS.—The discovery that microwaves could 
be generated by applying a steady voltage across a chip of n-type gallium-arsenide (GaAs) crystal was 
made in 1963 by J.B. Gunn. The device is operated by raising electrons in the crystal to conduction-band 
energy levels that are higher than the level they normally occupy. The overall effect is called the 
transferred-electron effect. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In a gallium-arsenide semiconductor, empty electron conduction bands exist that are at a higher 
energy level than the conduction bands occupied by most of the electrons. Any electrons that do occupy 
the higher conduction band essentially have no mobility. If an electric field of sufficient intensity is 
applied to the semiconductor electrons, they will move from the low-energy conduction band to the high-
energy conduction band and become essentially immobile. The immobile electrons no longer contribute 
to the current flow and the applied voltage progressively increases the rate at which the electrons move 
from the low band to the high band. As the curve in figure 2-48 shows, the maximum current rate is 
reached and begins to decrease even though the applied voltage continues to increase. The point at which 
the current on the curve begins to decrease is called the THRESHOLD. This point is the beginning of the 
negative-resistance region. Negative resistance is caused by electrons moving to the higher conduction 
band and becoming immobile. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

DOMAIN, forms that has an electric field of much greater intensity than the fields in the rest of the 
semiconductor. The applied voltage causes the domain to travel across the semiconductor chip from the 
cathode to the anode. The high field intensity of the domain is caused by the interaction of the slow 
electrons in the high-energy band and the faster electrons in the low-energy band. The electrons in the 
low-energy band travel faster than the moving domain and continually catch up during the transit from 
cathode to anode. When the fast electrons catch up to the domain, the high field intensity forces them into 
the higher band where they lose most of their mobility. This also causes them to fall behind the moving 
domain. Random scattering causes the electrons to lose some energy and drop back into the lower, faster, 
energy band and race again after the moving domain. The movement from the low-energy band to the 
high-energy band causes the electrons to bunch up at the back of the domain and to provide the electron-
transfer energy that creates the high field intensity in the domain. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The domains form at or near the cathode and move across the semiconductor to the anode, as shown 
in figure 2-49. As the domain disappears at the anode, a new domain forms near the cathode and repeats 
the process. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The GUNN OSCILLATOR is a source of microwave energy that uses the bulk-effect, gallium-
arsenide semiconductor. The basic frequency of a gunn oscillator is inversely proportional to the transit 
time of a domain across the semiconductor. The transit time is proportional to the length of 
semiconductor material, and to some extent, the voltage applied. Each domain causes a pulse of current at 
the output; thus, the output is a frequency determined by the physical length of the semiconductor chip. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The gunn oscillator can deliver continuous power up to about 65 milliwatts and pulsed outputs of up 
to about 200 watts peak. The power output of a solid chip is limited by the difficulty of removing heat 
from the small chip. Much higher power outputs have been achieved using wafers of gallium-arsenide as 
a single source.

pnin arrangement.The intrinsic (i) layer has neither p nor n properties.

avalanche in its depletion layer when the positive half cycle of a microwave signal is applied. The 
avalanche effect causes the electrons in the n region, which is very thin, to cross over to the intrinsic 
layer. The intrinsic layer is constructed so that the drift transit time causes the current to lag the signal 
voltage by more than 90 degrees at the desired frequency. Such a lag represents a negative resistance at 
the desired frequency. The pnin avalanche transit-time diode, when inserted in a microwave cavity with 
the proper dc bias, amplifies microwave signals introduced to the cavity. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Unlike the pn-junction diode, the point-contact diode depends on the pressure of contact between a 
point and a semiconductor crystal for its operation. Figure 2-51A and B, illustrate a point-contact diode. 
One section of the diode consists of a small rectangular crystal of n-type silicon. A fine berylium-copper, 
bronze-phosphor, or tungsten wire called the CATWHISKER presses against the crystal and forms the 
other part of the diode. During the manufacture of the point contact diode, a relatively large current is 
passed from the catwhisker to the silicon crystal. The result of this large current is the formation of a 
small region of p-type material around the crystal in the vicinity of the point contact. Thus, a pn-junction 
is formed which behaves in the same way as a normal pn-junction.

</p><p class="paragraph">With forward bias, the resistance of the point-contact diode is higher than that of the junction diode. 
With reverse bias, the current flow through a point-contact diode is not as independent of the voltage 
applied to the crystal as it is in the junction diode. The point-contact diode has an advantage over the 
junction diode because the capacitance between the catwhisker and the crystal is less than the capacitance 
between the two sides of the junction diode. As such, the capacitive reactance existing across the point-
contact diode is higher and the capacitive current that will flow in the circuit at high frequencies is 
smaller. A cutaway view of the entire point-contact diode is shown in figure 2-51C. The schematic 
symbol of a point-contact diode is shown in figure 2-51D. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Schottky Barrier Diode 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The SCHOTTKY BARRIER DIODE is actually a variation of the point-contact diode in which the 
metal semiconductor junction is a surface rather than a point contact. The large contact area, or barrier, 
between the metal and the semiconductor in the Schottky barrier diode provides some advantages over the 
point-contact diode. Lower forward resistance and lower noise generation are the most important 
advantages of the Schottky barrier diode. The applications of the Schottky barrier diode are the same as 
those of the point-contact diode. The low noise level generated by Schottky diodes makes them especially 
suitable as microwave receiver detectors and mixers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Schottky barrier diode is sometimes called the HOT-ELECTRON or HOT-CARRIER DIODE 
because the electrons flowing from the semiconductor to the metal have a higher energy level than the 
electrons in the metal. The effect is the same as it would be if the metal were heated to a higher 
temperature than normal. Figure 2-52 is an illustration of the construction of a Schottky barrier diode.

</h3><p class="paragraph">The pin diode consists of two narrow, but highly doped, semiconductor regions separated by a 
thicker, lightly-doped material called the intrinsic region. As suggested in the name, pin, one of the 
heavily doped regions is p-type material and the other is n-type. The same semiconductor material, 
usually silicon, is used for all three areas. Silicon is used most often for its power-handling capability and 
because it provides a highly resistive intrinsic (i) region. The pin diode acts as an ordinary diode at 
frequencies up to about 100 megahertz, but above this frequency the operational characteristics change. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The large intrinsic region increases the transit time of electrons crossing the region. Above 100 
megahertz, electrons begin to accumulate in the intrinsic region. The carrier storage in the intrinsic region

biased, and the diode presents no interference to power flow. When the diode is forward biased, the 
resistance drops to approximately 5 ohms and most power is reflected. In other words, the diode acts as a 
switch when mounted in parallel with a transmission line or waveguide. Several diodes in parallel can 
switch power in excess of 150 kilowatts peak. The upper power limit is determined by the ability of the 
diode to dissipate power. The upper frequency limit is determined by the shunt capacitance of the pn

the same problems encountered with vacuum tubes, such as transit-time effects, also limit the upper 
frequency range of transistors. However, research in the area of microwave transistors, and especially 
MICROWAVE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ICs), is proceeding rapidly. 
</p><p class="paragraph">GALLIUM-ARSENIDE FET AMPLIFIERS have been developed which provide low-noise 
amplification up to about 30 dB in the 7- to 18-gigahertz range. The power output of many of these 
amplifiers is relatively low, approximately 20 to 200 milliwatts, but that is satisfactory for many 
microwave applications. Research has extended both the frequency range and the power output of 
gallium-arsenide FET amplifiers to frequencies as high as 26.5 gigahertz and power levels in excess of 1 
watt in multistage amplifiers.

approaching 100 watts.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-3-1-">INTRODUCTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In this chapter you will study the general characteristics of microwave antennas that are widely used 
in radar and communications applications. The basic principles of operation of microwave antennas are 
similar to those of antennas used at lower frequencies. You might want to review the principles presented 
in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas, at this 
time. Pay particular attention to basic antenna principles in chapter 4 for a review of microwave antennas. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Antennas are devices used to radiate electromagnetic energy into space. The characteristics of 
transmitting and receiving antennas are similar, so a good transmitting antenna is often a good receiving 
antenna. A single antenna performs both functions in many modern applications. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ANTENNA-CHARACTERISTICS-3-1-">ANTENNA CHARACTERISTICS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Since the operating principles of low-frequency and microwave antennas are essentially the same, 
the electrical characteristics are also very similar. You will need a fundamental knowledge of radar and 
communications antenna electrical theory in your shipboard antenna maintenance work. Antenna theory 
is primarily a design consideration of antenna size and shape requirements that depend on the frequency 
used. A brief description of antenna electrical characteristics is sufficient for the needs of most students of 
electronics. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Antenna Efficiency 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The effectiveness of an antenna depends upon its ability to couple or radiate energy into the air. An 
efficient antenna is one which wastes very little energy during the radiation process. The efficiency of an 
antenna is usually referred to as the POWER GAIN or POWER RATIO as compared to a standard 
reference antenna. The power gain of an antenna is a ratio of the radiated power to that of the reference 
antenna, which is usually a basic dipole. Both antennas must be fed rf energy in the same manner and 
must be in the same position when the energy is radiated. The power gain of a single dipole without a 
reflector is unity (one). An array of several dipoles in the same position as the single dipole, and fed with 
the same line, has a power gain of more than one. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The effectiveness of an entire transmitting/ receiving system depends largely on impedance matching 
between the elements of the system. Impedance matching is particularly critical at the antenna connection. 
If a good impedance match is maintained between the system and the antenna throughout the operating 
frequency band, power transfer to and from the antenna is always maximum. The transmission line or 
waveguide used to transport energy to and from the antenna should have a characteristic impedance equal 
to that of the antenna. A proper impedance match allows all available power to be absorbed and radiated 
by the antenna without reflections back down the line. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you have a transmission line or waveguide with an impedance mismatch at the termination, 
standing waves are set up by the reflections. Standing waves cause losses in the form of unwanted 
radiations, heat losses in transmission lines, and arcing in waveguides. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The STANDING-WAVE RATIO, abbreviated swr, is a way to measure the degree of mismatch 
between the transmission line and its load. The swr can be expressed as a ratio of the maximum and 
minimum values of the current or voltage in the standing waves that are set up on the lines as follows: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A transmission line or waveguide approaches a perfectly matched condition when the swr 
approaches a value of 1. A ratio that is a little higher than 1 is usually acceptable in practical applications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Measurement of swr is the only practical method of detecting an impedance mismatch between a 
transmitting/receiving system and its antenna. As such, the system swr is an important indication of the 
overall efficiency of the system during operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The line impedance can usually be matched to the antenna at only one frequency. However, the swr 
will NOT become too high if the antenna is used over a small range of frequencies and the line is matched 
to the center frequency. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Antenna Directivity 
</h3><p class="paragraph">You can divide antennas into two general classes based on directivity, omnidirectional and 
directional. OMNIDIRECTIONAL antennas radiate and receive energy from all directions at once 
(SPHERICAL WAVEFRONT). They are seldom used in modern radar systems as the primary antenna, 
but are commonly used in radio equipment and iff (identification friend or foe) receivers. 
DIRECTIONAL antennas radiate energy in LOBES (or BEAMS) that extend outward from the antenna in 
either one or two directions. The radiation pattern contains small minor lobes, but these lobes are weak 
and normally have little effect on the main radiation pattern. Directional antennas also receive energy 
efficiently from only one or two directions, depending upon whether it is unidirectional or bidirectional. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Directional antennas have two characteristics that are important to you in radar and communications 
systems. One is DIRECTIVITY and the other is POWER GAIN. The directivity of an antenna refers to 
the NARROWNESS of the radiated beam. If the beam is NARROW in either the horizontal or vertical 
plane, the antenna has a high degree of directivity in that plane. An antenna may be designed for high 
directivity in one plane only or in both planes, depending on the application. The power gain of an </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">antenna increases as the degree of directivity increases because the power is concentrated into a narrow 
beam and less power is required to cover the same distance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since microwave antennas are predominantly unidirectional, the examples you will study in this 
chapter are all of the unidirectional type. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Reciprocity 
</h3><p class="paragraph">You read in this chapter that an antenna is able to both transmit and receive electromagnetic energy. 
This is known as RECIPROCITY. Antenna reciprocity is possible because antenna characteristics are 
essentially the same regardless of whether an antenna is transmitting or receiving electromagnetic energy. 
Reciprocity allows most radar and communications systems to operate with only one antenna. An 
automatic switch, called a DUPLEXER, connects either the transmitter or the receiver to the antenna at 
the proper time. Duplexer operation will be explained in later NEETS modules dealing with radar and 
communications systems. Because of the reciprocity of antennas, this chapter will discuss antennas from 
the viewpoint of the transmitting cycle. However, you should understand that the same principles apply 
on the receiving cycle. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Radar Fundamentals 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Radio, television, radar, and the human eye have much in common because they all process the same 
type of electromagnetic energy. The major difference between the light processed by the human eye and 
the radio-frequency energy processed by radio and radar is frequency. For example, radio transmitters 
send out signals in all directions. These signals can be detected by receivers tuned to the same frequency. 
Radar works somewhat differently because it uses reflected energy (echo) instead of directly transmitted 
energy. The echo, as it relates to sound, is a familiar concept to most of us. An experienced person can 
estimate the distance and general direction of an object causing a sound echo. Radar uses microwave 
electromagnetic energy in much the same way. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radar transmits microwave energy that reflects off an object and returns to the radar. The returned 
portion of the energy is called an ECHO, as it is in sound terminology. It is used to determine the 
direction and distance of the object causing the reflection. Determination of direction and distance to an 
object is the primary function of most radar systems. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Telescopes and radars, in terms of locating objects in space, have many common problems. Both 
have a limited field of view and both require a geographic reference system to describe the position of an 
object (target). The position of an object viewed with a telescope is usually described by relating it to a 
familiar object with a known position. Radar uses a standard system of reference coordinates to describe 
the position of an object in relation to the position of the radar. Normally ANGULAR measurements are 
made from true north in an imaginary flat plane called the HORIZONTAL PLANE. All angles in the UP 
direction are measured in a second imaginary plane perpendicular to the horizontal plane called the 
VERTICAL PLANE. The center of the coordinate system is the radar location. As shown in figure 3-1, 
the target position with respect to the radar is defined as 60 degrees true, 10 degrees up, and 10 miles 
distant. The line directly from the radar to the target is called the LINE OF SIGHT. The distance from 
point 1 to point 2, measured along the line of sight, is called TARGET RANGE. The angle between the 
horizontal plane and the line of sight is known as the ELEVATION ANGLE. The angle measured in a 
clockwise direction in the horizontal plane between true north and the line of sight is known as 
BEARING (sometimes referred to as AZIMUTH). These three coordinates of range, bearing, and 
elevation determine the location of the target with respect to the radar. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Bearing and elevation angles are determined by measuring the angular position of the radar antenna 
(the transmitted beam) when it is pointing directly at the target. Range is more difficult to determine 
because it cannot be directly measured. The radar system is designed to measure range as a function of 
time. Since the speed of electromagnetic energy is the same as the speed of light, range is determined by 
measuring the time required for a pulse of energy to reach the target and return to the radar. Because the 
speed of the pulse is known, the two-way distance can be determined by multiplying the time by the 
speed of travel. The total must be divided by two to obtain the one-way range because the time value used 
initially is the time required for the pulse to travel to the target and return.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-REFLECTOR-ANTENNAS-3-5-">REFLECTOR ANTENNAS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A spherical wavefront (one in which the energy spreads out in all directions) spreads out as it travels 
away from the antenna and produces a pattern that is not very directional. A wavefront that exists in only 
one plane does not spread because all of the wavefront moves forward in the same direction. For an 
antenna to be highly directive, it must change the normally spherical wavefront into a plane wavefront. 
Many highly directive microwave antennas produce a plane wavefront by using a reflector to focus the 
radiated energy. The PARABOLIC REFLECTOR is most often used for high directivity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Microwaves travel in straight lines as do light rays. They can also be focused and reflected just as 
light rays can, as illustrated by the antenna shown in figure 3-2. A microwave source is placed at focal 
point F. The field leaves this antenna as a spherical wavefront. As each part of the wavefront reaches the 
reflecting surface, it is phase-shifted 180 degrees. Each part is then sent outward at an angle that results in 
all parts of the field traveling in parallel paths. Because of the special shape of a parabolic surface, all 
paths from F to the reflector and back to line XY are the same length. Therefore, when the parts of the 
field are reflected from the parabolic surface, they travel to line XY in the same amount of time. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">If a dipole is used as the source of transmission, energy will be radiated from the antenna into space 
as well as toward the reflector. Energy which is not directed toward the paraboloid has a wide-beam 
characteristic which will destroy the narrow pattern of the parabolic reflector. However, a 
HEMISPHERICAL SHIELD (not shown) may be used to direct most of the radiation toward the 
parabolic surface and thus prevent the destruction of the narrow pattern. Direct radiation into space is 
eliminated, the beam is made sharper, and more power is concentrated in the beam. Without the shield, 
some of the radiated field would leave the radiator directly. Since this part of the field that would leave 
the radiator would not be reflected, it would not become a part of the main beam and could serve no 
useful purpose. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-3 the radiation pattern of a paraboloid reflector contains a major lobe and several minor 
lobes. The major lobe is directed along the axis of revolution. Very narrow beams are possible with this 
type of reflector. Figure 3-4 illustrates the basic paraboloid reflector. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Truncated Paraboloid 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-5A, shows a TRUNCATED PARABOLOID. Since the reflector is parabolic in the 
horizontal plane, the energy is focused into a narrow beam. With the reflector TRUNCATED (cut) so that 
it is shortened vertically, the beam spreads out vertically instead of being focused. This fan-shaped beam 
is used in radar detection applications for the accurate determination of bearing. Since the beam is spread 
vertically, it will detect aircraft at different altitudes without changing the tilt of the antenna. The 
truncated paraboloid also works well for surface search radar applications to compensate for the pitch and 
roll of the ship. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The truncated paraboloid may be used in target height-finding systems if the reflector is rotated 90 
degrees, as shown in figure 3-5B. Since the reflector is now parabolic in the vertical plane, the energy is 
focused vertically into a narrow beam. If the reflector is truncated, or cut, so that it is shortened 
horizontally, the beam will spread out horizontally instead of being focused. Such a fan-shaped beam is 
used to accurately determine elevation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

</h3><p class="paragraph">A section of a complete circular paraboloid, often called an ORANGE-PEEL REFLECTOR because 
of its orange-peel shape, is shown in figure 3-6. Since the reflector is narrow in the horizontal plane and 
wide in the vertical plane, it produces a beam that is wide in the horizontal plane and narrow in the 
vertical plane. In shape, the beam resembles a huge beaver tail. The microwave energy is sent into the 
parabolic reflector by a horn radiator (not shown) which is fed by a waveguide. The horn radiation pattern 
covers nearly the entire shape of the reflector, so almost all of the microwave energy strikes the reflector 
and very little escapes at the sides. Antenna systems which use orange-peel paraboloids are often used in 
height-finding equipment. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

another is desired, a cylindrical paraboloidal section which approximates a rectangle can be used. Figure 
3-7 illustrates such an antenna. A PARABOLIC CYLINDER has a parabolic cross section in just one 
dimension which causes the reflector to be directive in one plane only. The cylindrical paraboloid 
reflector is fed either by a linear array of dipoles, a slit in the side of a waveguide, or by a thin waveguide 
radiator. It also has a series of focal points forming a straight line rather than a single focal point. Placing 
the radiator, or radiators, along this focal line produces a directed beam of energy. As the width of the 
parabolic section is changed, different beam shapes are obtained. You may see this type of antenna 
system used in search radar systems and in ground control approach (gca) radar systems.

microwave frequencies. Because they do not use resonant elements, horns have the advantage of being 
useful over a wide frequency band. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The operation of a horn as an rf radiating device is similar to that of an automobile horn radiating 
sound waves. However, the throat of an automobile horn usually is sized much smaller than the sound 
wavelengths for which it is used. The throat of the rf radiating horn is sized to be comparable to the 
wavelength being used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Horn radiators are used with waveguides because they serve both as an impedance-matching device 
and as a directional radiator. Horn radiators may be fed by coaxial and other types of lines. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Horn radiators are constructed in a variety of shapes, as illustrated in figure 3-9. The shape of the 
horn determines the shape of the field pattern. The ratio of the horn length to the size of its mouth

source can be regarded as a gun which shoots the microwave energy toward the lens. The point source is 
often a horn radiator or a simple dipole antenna. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Waveguide Type 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The WAVEGUIDE-TYPE LENS is sometimes referred to as a conducting-type. It consists of 
several parallel concave metallic strips which are placed parallel to the electric field of the radiated energy 
fed to the lens, as shown in figure 3-10A and 3-10B. These strips act as waveguides in parallel for the 
incident (radiated) wave. The strips are placed slightly more than a half wavelength apart.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The radiated energy consists of an infinite number of RADIAL SECTIONS (RAYS). Each of the 
radial sections contains mutually perpendicular E and H lines and both are perpendicular to the direction 
of travel. Because each of the radial sections travels in a different direction, the point source, in itself, has 
poor directivity. The purpose of the lens is to convert the input spherical microwave segment (which 
consists of all of the radial sections) into parallel (collimated) lines in a given direction at the exit side of 
the lens. The focusing action of the lens is accomplished by the refracting qualities of the metallic strips. 
The collimating effect of the lens is possible because the velocity of electromagnetic energy propagation 
through metals is greater than its velocity through air. Because of the concave construction of the lens, 
wavefronts arriving near the ends of the lens travel farther in the same amount of time than do those at the 
center. Thus, the wavefront emerging from the exit side of the lens appears as a plane wave. It consists of 
an infinite number of parallel sections (with both the E field and H field components) mutually 
perpendicular to the direction of travel. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Delay lens 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Another type of lens that you may see is the DIELECTRIC or METALLIC DELAY LENS shown in 
figure 3-11. The delay lens, as its name implies, slows down the phase propagation (velocity) as the wave 
passes through the lens. The delay lens is convex and is constructed of dielectric material. The delay in 
the phase of the wave passing through the lens is determined by the DIELECTRIC CONSTANT 
(REFRACTIVE INDEX) of the material. In most cases, artificial dielectrics, consisting of conducting 
rods or spheres that are small compared to the wavelength, are used. (Artificial dielectrics are of 
three-dimensional construction and act as a dielectric to electromagnetic waves.) In this case the inner 
portion of the transmitted wave is decelerated for a longer interval of time than the outer portions. The 
delay causes the radiated wave to be collimated.

cells. Each cell contains a slow-wave (delayed), serrated-metal, plastic-supported waveguide element 
which acts as a phase-controlling device. A loaded lens can focus microwave energy in much the same 
way as the waveguide type. The reason is that the speed of propagation is higher in the region between 
parallel plates than in free space. The parallel plates support the cells.

used in multiple-beam applications where the polarization of the beams is different.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Sharply directive antennas can be constructed from two or more simple half-wave dipole elements. 
They must be positioned so that the fields from the elements add in some directions and cancel in others. 
Such a set of antenna elements is called an ANTENNA ARRAY. When a reflector is placed behind the 
dipole array, radiation occurs in one direction with a pattern similar to the one shown in figure 3-13. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">You will encounter two basic types of antenna arrays, PARASITIC and DRIVEN. Both types of 
antenna arrays were explained in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission 
Lines, and Antennas. Only a brief review is presented in this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The parabolic reflector antennas previously discussed and the antenna shown in figure 3-13 are 
examples of parasitic arrays. Notice that the reflector in figure 3-13 is not directly connected to the energy 
source. Driven arrays, in which all the radiating elements are connected to the energy source, have 
smaller losses than parasitic arrays while retaining some of the narrow-beam characteristics. Parasitic 
arrays, such as the parabolic reflector, are used primarily as antennas in fire control radars and other 
installations, such as microwave communication systems, that require very accurate (narrow) beams. 
Driven arrays are used primarily as search-radar antennas because extremely narrow beams are less 
critical than low losses. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you position a number of driven half-wave antenna elements with respect to each other so that 
energy from the individual elements will add in certain directions and cancel in other directions, then the 
antenna system is directional. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Signals from a number of different sources may contribute to or subtract from the overall effect. By 
properly phasing the energy fed to the antenna elements, and by properly locating the elements, you can 
control the direction of the energy. You can cause the energy to add in the desired direction and to be out 
of phase (cancel) in the undesired direction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Driven arrays are usually made up of a number of half-wave dipoles positioned and phased so that 
the desired directional pattern will be achieved. Figure 3-14, view (A), shows a simple antenna array </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

pattern of each array is shown beneath it. Note that the beam becomes sharper as the number of elements 
is increased. If a still-narrower beam is desired, you may add additional elements. The field patterns of the 
antennas in the figure are bidirectional. Unidirectional patterns may be obtained with a parasitic reflector 
mounted behind the driven antenna elements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The BEDSPRING ARRAY (figure 3-15), so called because of its resemblance to a bedspring, is an 
example of a unidirectional antenna. It consists of a stacked dipole array with an untuned reflector. The 
more dipoles that are used or stacked in one dimension (horizontal, for example), the more narrow the 
beam of radiated energy becomes in that plane. Consequently, the size of the antenna is not the same for 
all installations. Antennas such as the bedspring array are commonly used in TWO-DIMENSIONAL 
SEARCH RADARS that obtain the range and bearing information of a target. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The radar antenna in figure 3-16 uses a feed section to drive horizontally stacked array sections 
which radiate the applied rf pulses. The same array sections receive the target returns. Each array contains 
slots cut to radiate and receive a particular frequency. Bearing data is obtained by mechanically rotating 
the antenna 360 degrees. Elevation data is obtained by electronic scanning of the beam in elevation. The 
radar antenna is frequency sensitive and radiates pulses at an elevation angle determined by the applied 
frequency. When the frequency is increased, the beam elevation angle decreases. Conversely, when the 
applied frequency is decreased, the beam elevation angle increases. The beam elevation angle is therefore 
selected by the application of a frequency corresponding to the desired angle of elevation. The physical 
length of the antenna feed section, called the SERPENTINE SECTION (figure 3-17), in relation to the 
wavelength of the applied energy determines the direction of the radiated beam. You may understand this 
more clearly if you consider how the beam is shifted. The shift occurs with a change in frequency because 
the positive and negative peaks of the energy arrive at adjacent slotted arrays at different times. The 
change in the field pattern is such that the angle of departure (angle at which the radiated beam leaves the 
antenna) of the beam is changed. Note that a change in phase of the applied rf energy would cause the 
same effect.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Basic Slot Antenna and Its Complementary Dipole 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The slot antenna consists of a radiator formed by cutting a narrow slot in a large metal surface. Such 
an antenna is shown in figure 3-18. The slot length is a half wavelength at the desired frequency and the 
width is a small fraction of a wavelength. The antenna is frequently compared to a conventional half-
wave dipole consisting of two flat metal strips. The physical dimensions of the metal strips are such that 
they would just fit into the slot cut out of the large metal sheet. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This type of antenna is called the COMPLEMENTARY DIPOLE. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The slot antenna is compared to its complementary dipole to illustrate that the radiation patterns 
produced by a slot antenna cut into an infinitely large metal sheet and that of the complementary dipole 
antenna are the same. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Several important differences exist between the slot antenna and its complementary antenna. First, 
the electric and magnetic fields are interchanged. In the case of the dipole antenna shown in figure 3-18, 
the electric lines are horizontal while the magnetic lines form loops in the vertical plane. With the slot 
antenna, the magnetic lines are horizontal and the electric lines are vertical. The electric lines are built up 
across the narrow dimensions of the slot. As a result, the polarization of the radiation produced by a 
horizontal slot is vertical. If a vertical slot is used, the polarization is horizontal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A second difference between the slot antenna and its complementary dipole is that the direction of 
the lines of electric and magnetic force abruptly reverse from one side of the metal sheet to the other. In 
the case of the dipole, the electric lines have the same general direction while the magnetic lines form 
continuous closed loops. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When energy is applied to the slot antenna, currents flow in the metal sheet. These currents are not 
confined to the edges of the slot but rather spread out over the sheet. Radiation then takes place from both 
sides of the sheet. In the case of the complementary dipole, however, the currents are more confined; so a 
much greater magnitude of current is required to produce a given power output using the dipole antenna. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The current distribution of the dipole resembles the voltage distribution of the slot. The edges on the 
slot have a high voltage concentration and relatively low current distribution; the complementary dipole 
has a high current concentration and relatively low voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Slot antennas are adaptable for the vhf and uhf ranges. One of their practical advantages is that the 
feed section which energizes the slot may be placed below the large metal surface in which the slot is cut. 
Thus, nothing needs to extend from the surface. In addition, the slot itself may be covered by a section of 
insulating material to provide a seal so that the antenna can be pressurized with dry air. Dry air 
pressurization reduces moisture in the waveguide and prevents arcing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Many of the new radar systems reaching the fleet over the next few years will use frequency- or 
phase-sensitive antennas. Some of the new radars will use antennas that electronically scan the azimuth as 
well as elevation, eliminating the moving antenna.

the same. The efficiency of an antenna is expressed as a POWER GAIN or POWER RATIO as compared
