SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While

</p><h3 class="subsection">• To convert the optical signal back to an electrical signal
</h3><p class="paragraph">A fiber optic data link consists of three parts—transmitter, optical fiber, and receiver. Figure 1-1
is an illustration of a fiber optic data-link connection. The transmitter, optical fiber, and receiver perform
the basic functions of the fiber optic data link. Each part of the data link is responsible for the successful
transfer of the data signal. A fiber optic data link needs a transmitter that can effectively convert an
electrical input signal to an optical signal and launch the data-containing light down the optical fiber. A
fiber optic data link also needs a receiver that can effectively transform this optical signal back into its
original form. This means that the electrical signal provided as data output should exactly match the
electrical signal provided as data input.
</p><p class="paragraph">The transmitter converts the input signal to an optical signal suitable for transmission. The
transmitter consists of two parts, an interface circuit and a source drive circuit. The transmitter's drive
circuit converts the electrical signals to an optical signal. It does this by varying the current flow through
the light source. The two types of optical sources are light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The optical source launches the optical signal into the fiber. The optical signal will become
progressively weakened and distorted because of scattering, absorption, and dispersion mechanisms in the
fiber waveguides. Chapter 2 discusses the fiber mechanisms of scattering, absorption, and dispersion.
Chapter 3 discusses the types of optical fibers and cables.
</p><p class="paragraph">The receiver converts the optical signal exiting the fiber back into an electrical signal. The receiver
consists of two parts, the optical detector and the signal-conditioning circuits. An optical detector detects
the optical signal. The signal-conditioning circuit conditions the detector output so that the receiver output
matches the original input to the transmitter. The receiver should amplify and process the optical signal
without introducing noise or signal distortion. Noise is any disturbance that obscures or reduces the
quality of the signal. Noise effects and limitations of the signal-conditioning circuits cause the distortion
of the receiver's electrical output signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">An optical detector can be either a semiconductor positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diode or an
avalanche photodiode (APD). A PIN diode changes its electrical conductivity according to the intensity
and wavelength of light. The PIN diode consists of an intrinsic region between p-type and n-type
semiconductor material. Chapter 6 provides further explanation of optical sources. Chapter 7 provides
further explanation of optical detectors.
</p><p class="paragraph">A fiber optic data link also includes passive components other than an optical fiber. Figure 1-1 does
not show the optical connections used to complete the construction of the fiber optic data link. Passive
components used to make fiber connections affect the performance of the data link. These components
can also prevent the link from operating. Fiber optic components used to make the optical connections
include optical splices, connectors, and couplers. Chapter 4 outlines the types of optical splices,
connectors, and couplers and their connection properties that affect system performance.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">People have used light to transmit information for hundreds of years. However, it was not until the
1960s, with the invention of the laser, that widespread interest in optical (light) systems for data
communications began. The invention of the laser prompted researchers to study the potential of fiber
optics for data communications, sensing, and other applications. Laser systems could send a much larger
amount of data than telephone, microwave, and other electrical systems. The first experiment with the
laser involved letting the laser beam transmit freely through the air. Researchers also conducted
experiments letting the laser beam transmit through different types of waveguides. Glass fibers, gas-filled
pipes, and tubes with focusing lenses are examples of optical waveguides.
</p><p class="paragraph">Glass fibers soon became the preferred medium for fiber optic research. Initially, the very large
losses in the optical fibers prevented coaxial cables from being replaced. Loss is the decrease in the
amount of light reaching the end of the fiber. Early fibers had losses around 1,000 dB/km making them
impractical for communications use. In 1969, several scientists concluded that impurities in the fiber
material caused the signal loss in optical fibers. The basic fiber material did not prevent the light signal
from reaching the end of the fiber. These researchers believed it was possible to reduce the losses in
optical fibers by removing the impurities. By removing the impurities, construction of low-loss optical
fibers was possible.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two basic types of optical fibers, multimode fibers and single mode fibers. Chapter 2
discusses the differences between the fiber types. In 1970, Corning Glass Works made a multimode fiber
with losses under 20 dB/km. This same company, in 1972, made a high silica-core multimode optical
fiber with 4dB/km minimum attenuation (loss). Currently, multimode fibers can have losses as low as 0.5
dB/km at wavelengths around 1300 nm. Single mode fibers are available with losses lower than 0.25
dB/km at wavelengths around 1500 nm.
</p><p class="paragraph">Developments in semiconductor technology, which provided the necessary light sources and
detectors, furthered the development of fiber optics. Conventional light sources, such as lamps or lasers,
were not easily used in fiber optic systems. These light sources tended to be too large and required lens
systems to launch light into the fiber. In 1971, Bell Laboratories developed a small area light-emitting
diode (LED). This light source was suitable for low-loss coupling to optical fibers. Researchers could
then perform source-to-fiber jointing easily and repeatedly. Early semiconductor sources had operating
lifetimes of only a few hours. However, by 1973, projected lifetimes of lasers advanced from a few hours
to greater than 1,000 hours. By 1977, projected lifetimes of lasers advanced to greater than 7,000 hours.
By 1979, these devices were available with projected lifetimes of more than 100,000 hours.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

developed included low-loss fibers and fiber cables, splices, and connectors. These parts permitted
demonstration and research on complete fiber optic systems.

These applications are mostly in the telephone long-haul systems, but are growing to include cable
television, computer networks, video systems, and data links. Research should increase system
performance and provide solutions to existing problems in conventional applications. The impressive
results from early research show there are many advantages offered by fiber optic systems.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FIBER-OPTIC-SYSTEMS-1-4-">FIBER OPTIC SYSTEMS
</h2><p class="paragraph">System design has centered on long-haul communications and the subscriber-loop plant. The
subscriber-loop plant is the part of a system that connects a subscriber to the nearest switching center.
Cable television is an example. Limited work has also been done on short-distance applications and some
military systems. Initially, central office trunking required multimode optical fibers with moderate to
good performance. Fiber performance depends on the amount of loss and signal distortion introduced by
the fiber when it is operating at a specific wavelength. Long-haul systems require single mode optical
fibers with very high performance. Single mode fibers tend to have lower loss and produce less signal
distortion.
</p><p class="paragraph">In contrast, short-distance and military systems tend to use only multimode technology. Examples of
short-distance systems include process control and local area networks (LANs). Short-distance and
military systems have many connections. The larger fiber core and higher fiber numerical aperture (NA)
of multimode fibers reduce losses at these connections. Chapter 4 explains fiber connection properties in
more detail. Chapter 2 provides more detail on multimode and single mode fibers.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fiber optics deals with the transmission of light energy through transparent fibers. How an optical
fiber guides light depends on the nature of the light and the structure of the optical fiber. A light wave is a
form of energy that is moved by wave motion. Wave motion can be defined as a recurring disturbance
advancing through space with or without the use of a physical medium. In fiber optics, wave motion is the
movement of light energy through an optical fiber. To fully understand the concept of wave motion, refer
to NEETSModule 10—Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas. Before we
introduce the subject of light transmission through optical fibers, you must first understand the nature of
light and the properties of light waves.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PROPAGATION-OF-LIGHT-2-1-">PROPAGATION OF LIGHT
</h2><p class="paragraph">The exact nature of light is not fully understood, although people have been studying the subject for
many centuries. In the 1700s and before, experiments seemed to indicate that light was composed of
particles. In the early 1800s, a physicist Thomas Young showed that light exhibited wave characteristics.
Further experiments by other physicists culminated in James Clerk (pronounced Clark) Maxwell
collecting the four fundamental equations that completely describe the behavior of the electromagnetic
fields. James Maxwell deduced that light was simply a component of the electromagnetic spectrum. This
seems to firmly establish that light is a wave. Yet, in the early 1900s, the interaction of light with</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

wave theory. The advent of quantum physics successfully explained the photoelectric effect in terms of
fundamental particles of energy called quanta. Quanta are known as photons when referring to light
energy.
</p><p class="paragraph">Today, when studying light that consists of many photons, as in propagation, that light behaves as a
continuum—an electromagnetic wave. On the other hand, when studying the interaction of light with
semiconductors, as in sources and detectors, the quantum physics approach is taken. The wave versus
particle dilemma can be addressed in a more formal way, but that is beyond the scope of this text. It
suffices to say that much has been reconciled between the two using quantum physics. In this manual, we
use both the electromagnetic wave and photon concepts, each in the places where it best matches the
phenomenon we are studying.
</p><p class="paragraph">The electromagnetic energy of light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Light and similar forms
of radiation are made up of moving electric and magnetic forces. A simple example of motion similar to
these radiation waves can be made by dropping a pebble into a pool of water. In this example, the water is
not actually being moved by the outward motion of the wave, but rather by the up-and-down motion of
the water. The up-and-down motion is transverse, or at right angles, to the outward motion of the waves.
This type of wave motion is called transverse-wave motion. The transverse waves spread out in

of light spread from the sun. However, the waves in the pool are very slow and clumsy in comparison
with light, which travels approximately 186,000 miles per second.

all the light waves falling upon them are said to be transparent. A transparent substance is one through
which you can see clearly. Clear glass is transparent because it transmits light rays without diffusing them
(view A of figure 2-3). There is no substance known that is perfectly transparent, but many substances are
nearly so. Substances through which some light rays can pass, but through which objects cannot be seen

REFLECTION OF LIGHT
</p><p class="paragraph">Reflected waves are simply those waves that are neither transmitted nor absorbed, but are reflected
from the surface of the medium they encounter. When a wave approaches a reflecting surface, such as a
mirror, the wave that strikes the surface is called the incident wave, and the one that bounces back is
called the reflected wave (refer to figure 2-4). An imaginary line perpendicular to the point at which the
incident wave strikes the reflecting surface is called the normal, or the perpendicular. The angle between
the incident wave and the normal is called the angle of incidence. The angle between the reflected wave
and the normal is called the angle of reflection.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">If the surface of the medium contacted by the incident wave is smooth and polished, each reflected
wave will be reflected back at the same angle as the incident wave. The path of the wave reflected from
the surface forms an angle equal to the one formed by its path in reaching the medium. This conforms to
the law of reflection which states: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of incident-wave energy that is reflected from a surface depends on the nature of the
surface and the angle at which the wave strikes the surface. The amount of wave energy reflected
increases as the angle of incidence increases. The reflection of energy is the greatest when the wave is
nearly parallel to the reflecting surface. When the incidence wave is perpendicular to the surface, more of
the energy is transmitted into the substance and reflection of energy is at its least. At any incident angle, a
mirror reflects almost all of the wave energy, while a dull, black surface reflects very little.
</p><p class="paragraph">Light waves obey the law of reflection. Light travels in a straight line through a substance of uniform
density. For example, you can see the straight path of light rays admitted through a narrow slit into a
darkened room. The straight path of the beam is made visible by illuminated dust particles suspended in
the air. If the light is made to fall onto the surface of a mirror or other reflecting surface, however, the
direction of the beam changes sharply. The light can be reflected in almost any direction, depending on
the angle with which the mirror is held.

</h2><p class="paragraph">When a light wave passes from one medium into a medium having a different velocity of
propagation (the speed waves can travel through a medium), a change in the direction of the wave will
occur. This change of direction as the wave enters the second medium is called refraction. As in the
discussion of reflection, the wave striking the boundary (surface) is called the incident wave, and the
imaginary line perpendicular to the boundary is called the normal. The angle between the incident wave
and the normal is called the angle of incidence. As the wave passes through the boundary, it is bent either
toward or away from the normal. The angle between the normal and the path of the wave through the
second medium is the angle of refraction.
</p><p class="paragraph">A light wave passing through a block of glass is shown in figure 2-5. The wave moves from point A
to point B at a constant speed. This is the incident wave. As the wave penetrates the glass boundary at
point B, the velocity of the wave is slowed down. This causes the wave to bend toward the normal. The
wave then takes the path from point B to point C through the glass and becomes both the refracted wave
from the top surface and the incident wave to the lower surface. As the wave passes from the glass to the
air (the second boundary), it is again refracted, this time away from the normal, and takes the path from
point C to point D. After passing through the last boundary, the velocity increases to the original velocity
of the wave. As illustrated, refracted waves can bend toward or away from the normal. This bending
depends on the velocity of the wave through different mediums. The broken line between points B and E
is the path that the wave would travel if the two mediums (air and glass) had the same density.

a more dense medium, it is bent toward the normal, and the angle of refraction (r) is less than the angle of
incidence (i). Likewise, if the wave passes from a more dense to a less dense medium, it is bent away
from the normal, and the angle of refraction (r1) is greater than the angle of incidence (i1).
</p><p class="paragraph">An example of refraction is the apparent bending of a spoon when it is immersed in a cup of water.
The bending seems to take place at the surface of the water, or exactly at the point where there is a change
of density. Obviously, the spoon does not bend from the pressure of the water. The light forming the
image of the spoon is bent as it passes from the water (a medium of high density) to the air (a medium of
comparatively low density).
</p><p class="paragraph">Without refraction, light waves would pass in straight lines through transparent substances without
any change of direction. Figure 2-5 shows that rays striking the glass at any angle other than
perpendicular are refracted. However, perpendicular rays, which enter the glass normal to the surface,
continue through the glass and into the air in a straight line—no refraction takes place.

of light (c) in free space (vacuum) is 3 · 108 meters per second (m/s). The speed of light is the frequency
(f) of light multiplied by the wavelength of light (ÿ). When light enters the fiber material (an optically
dense medium), the light travels slower at a speed (v). Light will always travel slower in the fiber material
than in air. The index of refraction is given by:

encounters the glass-air boundary, there are two results. The first result is that part of the ray is reflected
back into the glass. The second result is that part of the ray is refracted (bent) as it enters the air. The
bending of the light at the glass-air interface is the result of the difference between the index of
refractions. Since n 1 is greater than n2, the angle of refraction (� 2) will be greater than the angle of
incidence (� 1). Snell's law of refraction is used to describe the relationship between the incident and the

reflection occurs is called the critical angle of incidence. The critical angle of incidence (� ) is shown in

</p><h3 class="subsection">Ray Theory
</h3><p class="paragraph">Two types of rays can propagate along an optical fiber. The first type is called meridional rays.
Meridional rays are rays that pass through the axis of the optical fiber. Meridional rays are used to
illustrate the basic transmission properties of optical fibers. The second type is called skew rays. Skew
rays are rays that travel through an optical fiber without passing through its axis.
</p><p class="paragraph">MERIDIONAL RAYS.—Meridional rays can be classified as bound or unbound rays. Bound rays
remain in the core and propagate along the axis of the fiber. Bound rays propagate through the fiber by
total internal reflection. Unbound rays are refracted out of the fiber core. Figure 2-10 shows a possible
path taken by bound and unbound rays in a step-index fiber. The core of the step-index fiber has an index
of refraction n1. The cladding of a step-index has an index of refraction n2, that is lower than n1. Figure
2-10 assumes the core-cladding interface is perfect. However, imperfections at the core-cladding interface
will cause part of the bound rays to be refracted out of the core into the cladding. The light rays refracted
into the cladding will eventually escape from the fiber. In general, meridional rays follow the laws of
reflection and refraction.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is known that bound rays propagate in fibers due to total internal reflection, but how do these light
rays enter the fiber? Rays that enter the fiber must intersect the core-cladding interface at an angle greater
than the critical angle (� c). Only those rays that enter the fiber and strike the interface at these angles will
propagate along the fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">How a light ray is launched into a fiber is shown in figure 2-11. The incident ray I1 enters the fiber at
the angle � a. I1 is refracted upon entering the fiber and is transmitted to the core-cladding interface. The
ray then strikes the core-cladding interface at the critical angle (� c). I1 is totally reflected back into the
core and continues to propagate along the fiber. The incident ray I2 enters the fiber at an angle greater
than � a. Again, I2 is refracted upon entering the fiber and is transmitted to the core-cladding interface. I2
strikes the core-cladding interface at an angle less than the critical angle (� c). I2 is refracted into the
cladding and is eventually lost. The light ray incident on the fiber core must be within the acceptance
cone defined by the angle � a shown in figure 2-12. Angle � a is defined as the acceptance angle. The
acceptance angle (� a) is the maximum angle to the axis of the fiber that light entering the fiber is</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Since the medium next to the fiber at the launching point is normally air, n0 is equal to 1.00. The NA
is then simply equal to sin � a.
</p><p class="paragraph">The NA is a convenient way to measure the light-gathering ability of an optical fiber. It is used to
measure source-to-fiber power-coupling efficiencies. A high NA indicates a high source-to-fiber coupling
efficiency. Source-to-fiber coupling efficiency is described in chapter 6. Typical values of NA range from
0.20 to 0.29 for glass fibers. Plastic fibers generally have a higher NA. An NA for plastic fibers can be
higher than 0.50.
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition, the NA is commonly used to specify multimode fibers. However, for small core
diameters, such as in single mode fibers, the ray theory breaks down. Ray theory describes only the
direction a plane wave takes in a fiber. Ray theory eliminates any properties of the plane wave that
interfere with the transmission of light along a fiber. In reality, plane waves interfere with each other.
Therefore, only certain types of rays are able to propagate in an optical fiber. Optical fibers can support
only a specific number of guided modes. In small core fibers, the number of modes supported is one or
only a few modes. Mode theory is used to describe the types of plane waves able to propagate along an
optical fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">SKEW RAYS.—A possible path of propagation of skew rays is shown in figure 2-13. Figure 2-13,
view A, provides an angled view and view B provides a front view. Skew rays propagate without passing
through the center axis of the fiber. The acceptance angle for skew rays is larger than the acceptance
angle of meridional rays. This condition explains why skew rays outnumber meridional rays. Skew rays
are often used in the calculation of light acceptance in an optical fiber. The addition of skew rays
increases the amount of light capacity of a fiber. In large NA fibers, the increase may be significant.

near the edge of the fiber core. A large portion of the number of skew rays that are trapped in the fiber

</h3><p class="paragraph">The mode theory, along with the ray theory, is used to describe the propagation of light along an
optical fiber. The mode theory is used to describe the properties of light that ray theory is unable to
explain. The mode theory uses electromagnetic wave behavior to describe the propagation of light along a
fiber. A set of guided electromagnetic waves is called the modes of the fiber.

</p><p class="paragraph">PLANEWAVES.—The mode theory suggests that a light wave can be represented as a plane wave.
A plane wave is described by its direction, amplitude, and wavelength of propagation. A plane wave is a
wave whose surfaces of constant phase are infinite parallel planes normal to the direction of propagation.
The planes having the same phase are called the wavefronts. The wavelength (ÿ) of the plane wave is
given by:

wavefronts, propagate along the fiber similar to light rays. However, not all wavefronts incident on the
fiber at angles less than or equal to the critical angle of light acceptance propagate along the fiber.
Wavefronts may undergo a change in phase that prevents the successful transfer of light along the fiber.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

wavefront incident on the core of an optical fiber as shown in figure 2-15. Only those wavefronts incident
on the fiber at angles less than or equal to the critical angle may propagate along the fiber. The wavefront
undergoes a gradual phase change as it travels down the fiber. Phase changes also occur when the
wavefront is reflected. The wavefront must remain in phase after the wavefront transverses the fiber twice
and is reflected twice. The distance transversed is shown between point A and point B on figure 2-15. The
reflected waves at point A and point B are in phase if the total amount of phase collected is an integer
multiple of 2p radian. If propagating wavefronts are not in phase, they eventually disappear. Wavefronts
disappear because of destructive interference. The wavefronts that are in phase interfere with the
wavefronts that are out of phase. This interference is the reason why only a finite number of modes can
propagate along the fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">The plane waves repeat as they travel along the fiber axis. The direction the plane waves travel is
assumed to be the z direction as shown in figure 2-15. The plane waves repeat at a distance equal to

propagating along the fiber. The mode is no longer bound to the fiber. The mode is said to be cut off.
Modes that are bound at one wavelength may not exist at longer wavelengths. The wavelength at which a
mode ceases to be bound is called the cutoff wavelength for that mode. However, an optical fiber is
always able to propagate at least one mode. This mode is referred to as the fundamental mode of the fiber.
The fundamental mode can never be cut off. The wavelength that prevents the next higher mode from
propagating is called the cutoff wavelength of the fiber. An optical fiber that operates above the cutoff
wavelength (at a longer wavelength) is called a single mode fiber. An optical fiber that operates below the
cutoff wavelength is called a multimode fiber. Single mode and multimode optical fibers are discussed
later in this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">In a fiber, the propagation constant of a plane wave is a function of the wave's wavelength and mode.
The change in the propagation constant for different waves is called dispersion. The change in the
propagation constant for different wavelengths is called chromatic dispersion. The change in propagation
constant for different modes is called modal dispersion. These dispersions cause the light pulse to spread
as it goes down the fiber (fig. 2-16). Some dispersion occurs in all types of fibers. Dispersion is discussed
later in this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">MODES.—A set of guided electromagnetic waves is called the modes of an optical fiber. Maxwell's
equations describe electromagnetic waves or modes as having two components. The two components are
the electric field, E(x, y, z), and the magnetic field, H(x, y, z). The electric field, E, and the magnetic
field, H, are at right angles to each other. Modes traveling in an optical fiber are said to be transverse. The
transverse modes, shown in figure 2-17, propagate along the axis of the fiber. The mode field patterns
shown in figure 2-17 are said to be transverse electric (TE). In TE modes, the electric field is
perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The magnetic field is in the direction of propagation.
Another type of transverse mode is the transverse magnetic (TM) mode. TM modes are opposite to TE
modes. In TM modes, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The electric
field is in the direction of propagation. Figure 2-17 shows only TE modes.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The TE mode field patterns shown in figure 2-17 indicate the order of each mode. The order of each
mode is indicated by the number of field maxima within the core of the fiber. For example, TE0 has one
field maxima. The electric field is a maximum at the center of the waveguide and decays toward the core-
cladding boundary. TE0 is considered the fundamental mode or the lowest order standing wave. As the
number of field maxima increases, the order of the mode is higher. Generally, modes with more than a
few (5-10) field maxima are referred to as high-order modes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The order of the mode is also determined by the angle the wavefront makes with the axis of the fiber.
Figure 2-18 illustrates light rays as they travel down the fiber. These light rays indicate the direction of
the wavefronts. High-order modes cross the axis of the fiber at steeper angles. Low-order and high-order
modes are shown in figure 2-18.

core of the fiber. The modes extend partially into the cladding material. Low-order modes penetrate the
cladding only slightly. In low-order modes, the electric and magnetic fields are concentrated near the
center of the fiber. However, high-order modes penetrate further into the cladding material. In high-order
modes, the electrical and magnetic fields are distributed more toward the outer edges of the fiber.

As the core and the cladding modes travel along the fiber, mode coupling occurs. Mode coupling is the
exchange of power between two modes. Mode coupling to the cladding results in the loss of power from
the core modes.
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to bound and refracted modes, there are leaky modes. Leaky modes are similar to leaky
rays. Leaky modes lose power as they propagate along the fiber. For a mode to remain within the core, the
mode must meet certain boundary conditions. A mode remains bound if the propagation constant b meets
the following boundary condition:
</p><p class="paragraph">where n1 and n2 are the index of refraction for the core and the cladding, respectively. When the
propagation constant becomes smaller than 2 p n2/ÿ, power leaks out of the core and into the cladding.
Generally, modes leaked into the cladding are lost in a few centimeters. However, leaky modes can carry
a large amount of power in short fibers.
</p><p class="paragraph">NORMALIZED FREQUENCY.—Electromagnetic waves bound to an optical fiber are described
by the fiber's normalized frequency. The normalized frequency determines how many modes a fiber can
support. Normalized frequency is a dimensionless quantity. Normalized frequency is also related to the
fiber's cutoff wavelength. Normalized frequency (V) is defined as:
</p><p class="paragraph">where n1 is the core index of refraction, n2 is the cladding index of refraction, a is the core diameter, and ÿ
is the wavelength of light in air.
</p><p class="paragraph">The number of modes that can exist in a fiber is a function of V. As the value of V increases, the
number of modes supported by the fiber increases. Optical fibers, single mode and multimode, can

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OPTICAL-FIBER-TYPES-2-20-">OPTICAL FIBER TYPES
</h2><p class="paragraph">Optical fibers are characterized by their structure and by their properties of transmission. Basically,
optical fibers are classified into two types. The first type is single mode fibers. The second type is
multimode fibers. As each name implies, optical fibers are classified by the number of modes that
propagate along the fiber. As previously explained, the structure of the fiber can permit or restrict modes
from propagating in a fiber. The basic structural difference is the core size. Single mode fibers are
manufactured with the same materials as multimode fibers. Single mode fibers are also manufactured by
following the same fabrication process as multimode fibers.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Single Mode Fibers
</h3><p class="paragraph">The core size of single mode fibers is small. The core size (diameter) is typically around 8 to 10
micrometers (�m). A fiber core of this size allows only the fundamental or lowest order mode to
propagate around a 1300 nanometer (nm) wavelength. Single mode fibers propagate only one mode,
because the core size approaches the operational wavelength (ÿ). The value of the normalized frequency
parameter (V) relates core size with mode propagation. In single mode fibers, V is less than or equal to
2.405. When V � 2.405, single mode fibers propagate the fundamental mode down the fiber core, while
high-order modes are lost in the cladding. For low V values (� 1.0), most of the power is propagated in the
cladding material. Power transmitted by the cladding is easily lost at fiber bends. The value of V should
remain near the 2.405 level.
</p><p class="paragraph">Single mode fibers have a lower signal loss and a higher information capacity (bandwidth) than
multimode fibers. Single mode fibers are capable of transferring higher amounts of data due to low fiber
dispersion. Basically, dispersion is the spreading of light as light propagates along a fiber. Dispersion
mechanisms in single mode fibers are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Signal loss depends
on the operational wavelength (ÿ). In single mode fibers, the wavelength can increase or decrease the
losses caused by fiber bending. Single mode fibers operating at wavelengths larger than the cutoff
wavelength lose more power at fiber bends. They lose power because light radiates into the cladding,
which is lost at fiber bends. In general, single mode fibers are considered to be low-loss fibers, which
increase system bandwidth and length.
</p><p class="question">Q34. The value of the normalized frequency parameter (V) relates the core size with mode
propagation. When single mode fibers propagate only the fundamental mode, what is the value of
V?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Multimode Fibers
</h3><p class="paragraph">As their name implies, multimode fibers propagate more than one mode. Multimode fibers can
propagate over 100 modes. The number of modes propagated depends on the core size and numerical
aperture (NA). As the core size and NA increase, the number of modes increases. Typical values of fiber
core size and NA are 50 to 100 �m and 0.20 to 0.29, respectively.
</p><p class="paragraph">A large core size and a higher NA have several advantages. Light is launched into a multimode fiber
with more ease. The higher NA and the larger core size make it easier to make fiber connections. During
fiber splicing, core-to-core alignment becomes less critical. Another advantage is that multimode fibers
permit the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Single mode fibers typically must use laser diodes. LEDs
are cheaper, less complex, and last longer. LEDs are preferred for most applications.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Multimode fibers also have some disadvantages. As the number of modes increases, the effect of
modal dispersion increases. Modal dispersion (intermodal dispersion) means that modes arrive at the fiber
end at slightly different times. This time difference causes the light pulse to spread. Modal dispersion
affects system bandwidth. Fiber manufacturers adjust the core diameter, NA, and index profile properties
of multimode fibers to maximize system bandwidth.
</p><p class="question">Q35. The number of modes propagated in a multimode fiber depends on core size and numerical
aperture (NA). If the core size and the NA decrease, will the number of modes propagated
increase or decrease?

</h2><p class="paragraph">The principles behind the transfer of light along an optical fiber were discussed earlier in this
chapter. You learned that propagation of light depended on the nature of light and the structure of the
optical fiber. However, our discussion did not describe how optical fibers affect system performance. In
this case, system performance deals with signal loss and bandwidth.
</p><p class="paragraph">Signal loss and system bandwidth describe the amount of data transmitted over a specified length of
fiber. Many optical fiber properties increase signal loss and reduce system bandwidth. The most important
properties that affect system performance are fiber attenuation and dispersion.
</p><p class="paragraph">Attenuation reduces the amount of optical power transmitted by the fiber. Attenuation controls the
distance an optical signal (pulse) can travel as shown in figure 2-19. Once the power of an optical pulse is
reduced to a point where the receiver is unable to detect the pulse, an error occurs. Attenuation is mainly a
result of light absorption, scattering, and bending losses. Dispersion spreads the optical pulse as it
travels along the fiber. This spreading of the signal pulse reduces the system bandwidth or the
information-carrying capacity of the fiber. Dispersion limits how fast information is transferred as shown
in figure 2-19. An error occurs when the receiver is unable to distinguish between input pulses caused by
the spreading of each pulse. The effects of attenuation and dispersion increase as the pulse travels the
length of the fiber as shown in figure 2-20.

introductory level material. However, you should be aware that attenuation and dispersion are not the
only fiber properties that affect performance.
</p><p class="question">Q37. Attenuation is mainly a result of what three properties?
Attenuation
</p><p class="paragraph">Attenuation in an optical fiber is caused by absorption, scattering, and bending losses. Attenuation
is the loss of optical power as light travels along the fiber. Signal attenuation is defined as the ratio of
optical input power (Pi) to the optical output power (Po). Optical input power is the power injected into
the fiber from an optical source. Optical output power is the power received at the fiber end or optical
detector. The following equation defines signal attenuation as a unit of length:
</p><p class="paragraph">Signal attenuation is a log relationship. Length (L) is expressed in kilometers. Therefore, the unit of
attenuation is decibels/kilometer (dB/km).
</p><p class="paragraph">As previously stated, attenuation is caused by absorption, scattering, and bending losses. Each
mechanism of loss is influenced by fiber-material properties and fiber structure. However, loss is also
present at fiber connections. Fiber connector, splice, and coupler losses are discussed in chapter 4. The
present discussion remains relative to optical fiber attenuation properties.
</p><p class="question">Q38. Define attenuation.
ABSORPTION.—Absorption is a major cause of signal loss in an optical fiber. Absorption is

</p><p class="paragraph">Intrinsic Absorption.—Intrinsic absorption is caused by basic fiber-material properties. If an optical
fiber were absolutely pure, with no imperfections or impurities, then all absorption would be intrinsic.
Intrinsic absorption sets the minimal level of absorption. In fiber optics, silica (pure glass) fibers are used
predominately. Silica fibers are used because of their low intrinsic material absorption at the wavelengths
of operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">In silica glass, the wavelengths of operation range from 700 nanometers (nm) to 1600 nm. Figure
2-21 shows the level of attenuation at the wavelengths of operation. This wavelength of operation is
between two intrinsic absorption regions. The first region is the ultraviolet region (below 400-nm
wavelength). The second region is the infrared region (above 2000-nm wavelength).
</p><p class="paragraph">Intrinsic absorption in the ultraviolet region is caused by electronic absorption bands. Basically,
absorption occurs when a light particle (photon) interacts with an electron and excites it to a higher
energy level. The tail of the ultraviolet absorption band is shown in figure 2-21.
</p><p class="paragraph">The main cause of intrinsic absorption in the infrared region is the characteristic vibration frequency
of atomic bonds. In silica glass, absorption is caused by the vibration of silicon-oxygen (Si-O) bonds. The
interaction between the vibrating bond and the electromagnetic field of the optical signal causes intrinsic
absorption. Light energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the bond. The tail of the infrared
absorption band is shown in figure 2-21.

energy level to another.
</p><p class="paragraph">Extrinsic absorption also occurs when hydroxyl ions (OH -) are introduced into the fiber. Water in
silica glass forms a silicon-hydroxyl (Si-OH) bond. This bond has a fundamental absorption at 2700 nm.
However, the harmonics or overtones of the fundamental absorption occur in the region of operation.
These harmonics increase extrinsic absorption at 1383 nm, 1250 nm, and 950 nm. Figure 2-21 shows the
presence of the three OH� harmonics. The level of the OH� harmonic absorption is also indicated.
</p><p class="paragraph">These absorption peaks define three regions or windows of preferred operation. The first window is
centered at 850 nm. The second window is centered at 1300 nm. The third window is centered at 1550
nm. Fiber optic systems operate at wavelengths defined by one of these windows.
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of water (OH�) impurities present in a fiber should be less than a few parts per billion.
Fiber attenuation caused by extrinsic absorption is affected by the level of impurities (OH �) present in the
fiber. If the amount of impurities in a fiber is reduced, then fiber attenuation is reduced.

regions. What are these two regions called? What are the wavelengths of operation for these two
regions?

</p><p class="paragraph">SCATTERING.—Basically, scattering losses are caused by the interaction of light with density
fluctuations within a fiber. Density changes are produced when optical fibers are manufactured. During
manufacturing, regions of higher and lower molecular density areas, relative to the average density of the
fiber, are created. Light traveling through the fiber interacts with the density areas as shown in figure
2-22. Light is then partially scattered in all directions.
</p><p class="paragraph">In commercial fibers operating between 700-nm and 1600-nm wavelength, the main source of loss is
called Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering is the main loss mechanism between the ultraviolet and

is called Mie scattering. Mie scattering, caused by these large defects in the fiber core, scatters light out of
the fiber core. However, in commercial fibers, the effects of Mie scattering are insignificant. Optical
fibers are manufactured with very few large defects.
</p><p class="question">Q42. What is the main loss mechanism between the ultraviolet and infrared absorption regions?
Q43. Scattering losses are caused by the interaction of light with density fluctuations within a fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">What are the two scattering mechanisms called when the size of the density fluctuations is
(a) greater than and (b) less than one-tenth of the operating wavelength?
</p><p class="paragraph">BENDING LOSS.—Bending the fiber also causes attenuation. Bending loss is classified according
to the bend radius of curvature: microbend loss or macrobend loss. Microbends are small microscopic
bends of the fiber axis that occur mainly when a fiber is cabled. Macrobends are bends having a large
radius of curvature relative to the fiber diameter. Microbend and macrobend losses are very important loss
mechanisms. Fiber loss caused by microbending can still occur even if the fiber is cabled correctly.
During installation, if fibers are bent too sharply, macrobend losses will occur.
</p><p class="paragraph">Microbend losses are caused by small discontinuities or imperfections in the fiber. Uneven coating
applications and improper cabling procedures increase microbend loss. External forces are also a source
of microbends. An external force deforms the cabled jacket surrounding the fiber but causes only a small
bend in the fiber. Microbends change the path that propagating modes take, as shown in figure 2-23.
Microbend loss increases attenuation because low-order modes become coupled with high-order modes
that are naturally lossy.
</p><p class="paragraph">Macrobend losses are observed when a fiber bend's radius of curvature is large compared to the fiber
diameter. These bends become a great source of loss when the radius of curvature is less than several
centimeters. Light propagating at the inner side of the bend travels a shorter distance than that on the</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

fiber bend is less than some critical radius, the mode phase velocity must increase to a speed greater than
the speed of light. However, it is impossible to exceed the speed of light. This condition causes some of
the light within the fiber to be converted to high-order modes. These high-order modes are then lost or
radiated out of the fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber sensitivity to bending losses can be reduced. If the refractive index of the core is increased,
then fiber sensitivity decreases. Sensitivity also decreases as the diameter of the overall fiber increases.
However, increases in the fiber core diameter increase fiber sensitivity. Fibers with larger core size
propagate more modes. These additional modes tend to be more lossy.
</p><p class="question">Q44. Microbend loss is caused by microscopic bends of the fiber axis. List three sources of microbend
loss.
</p><p class="question">Q45. How is fiber sensitivity to bending losses reduced?
DISPERSION
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two different types of dispersion in optical fibers. The types are intramodal and intermodal
dispersion. Intramodal, or chromatic, dispersion occurs in all types of fibers. Intermodal, or modal,
dispersion occurs only in multimode fibers. Each type of dispersion mechanism leads to pulse spreading.
As a pulse spreads, energy is overlapped. This condition is shown in figure 2-24. The spreading of the
optical pulse as it travels along the fiber limits the information capacity of the fiber.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Intramodal Dispersion
</h3><p class="paragraph">Intramodal, or chromatic, dispersion depends primarily on fiber materials. There are two types of
intramodal dispersion. The first type is material dispersion. The second type is waveguide dispersion.
Intramodal dispersion occurs because different colors of light travel through different materials and
different waveguide structures at different speeds.
</p><p class="paragraph">Material dispersion occurs because the spreading of a light pulse is dependent on the wavelengths'
interaction with the refractive index of the fiber core. Different wavelengths travel at different speeds in
the fiber material. Different wavelengths of a light pulse that enter a fiber at one time exit the fiber at
different times. Material dispersion is a function of the source spectral width. The spectral width specifies
the range of wavelengths that can propagate in the fiber. Material dispersion is less at longer wavelengths.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Waveguide dispersion occurs because the mode propagation constant ( b ) is a function of the size of
the fiber's core relative to the wavelength of operation. Waveguide dispersion also occurs because light
propagates differently in the core than in the cladding.
</p><p class="paragraph">In multimode fibers, waveguide dispersion and material dispersion are basically separate properties.
Multimode waveguide dispersion is generally small compared to material dispersion. Waveguide
dispersion is usually neglected. However, in single mode fibers, material and waveguide dispersion are
interrelated. The total dispersion present in single mode fibers may be minimized by trading material and
waveguide properties depending on the wavelength of operation.
</p><p class="question">Q46. Name the two types of intramodal, or chromatic, dispersion.
Q47. Which dispersion mechanism (material or waveguide) is a function of the size of the fiber's core
</p><p class="paragraph">relative to the wavelength of operation?
Intermodal Dispersion
</p><p class="paragraph">Intermodal or modal dispersion causes the input light pulse to spread. The input light pulse is made
up of a group of modes. As the modes propagate along the fiber, light energy distributed among the
modes is delayed by different amounts. The pulse spreads because each mode propagates along the fiber
at different speeds. Since modes travel in different directions, some modes travel longer distances. Modal
dispersion occurs because each mode travels a different distance over the same time span, as shown in
figure 2-25. The modes of a light pulse that enter the fiber at one time exit the fiber a different times. This
condition causes the light pulse to spread. As the length of the fiber increases, modal dispersion increases.
</p><p class="paragraph">Modal dispersion is the dominant source of dispersion in multimode fibers. Modal dispersion does
not exist in single mode fibers. Single mode fibers propagate only the fundamental mode. Therefore,
single mode fibers exhibit the lowest amount of total dispersion. Single mode fibers also exhibit the
highest possible bandwidth.

condition causes the light pulse to spread. What is this condition called?</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

along an optical fiber. A set of guided electromagnetic waves are called the modes of the fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">MODES traveling in an optical fiber are said to be transverse. Modes are described by their electric,

</h2><p class="paragraph">Optical fibers are thin cylindrical dielectric (non-conductive) waveguides used to send light energy
for communication. Optical fibers consist of three parts: the core, the cladding, and the coating or buffer.
The choice of optical fiber materials and fiber design depends on operating conditions and intended
application. Optical fibers are protected from the environment by incorporating the fiber into some type of
cable structure. Cable strength members and outer jackets protect the fiber. Optical cable structure and
material composition depend on the conditions of operation and the intended application.

according to the number of modes that they can propagate. Single mode fibers can propagate only the
fundamental mode. Multimode fibers can propagate hundreds of modes. However, the classification of an

</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Single mode graded-index fibers
</h3><p class="paragraph">In a step-index fiber, the refractive index of the core is uniform and undergoes an abrupt change at
the core-cladding boundary. Step-index fibers obtain their name from this abrupt change called the step
change in refractive index. In graded-index fibers, the refractive index of the core varies gradually as a
function of radial distance from the fiber center.
</p><p class="paragraph">Single mode and multimode fibers can have a step-index or graded-index refractive index profile.
The performance of multimode graded-index fibers is usually superior to multimode step-index fibers.
However, each type of multimode fiber can improve system design and operation depending on the
intended application. Performance advantages for single mode graded-index fibers compared to single
mode step-index fibers are relatively small. Therefore, single mode fiber production is almost exclusively
step-index. Figure 3-1 shows the refractive index profile for a multimode step-index fiber and a
multimode graded-index fiber. Figure 3-1 also shows the refractive index profile for a single mode step-
index fiber. Since light propagates differently in each fiber type, figure 3-1 shows the propagation of light
along each fiber.

</p><p class="paragraph">In chapter 2, you learned that fiber core size and material composition can affect system
performance. A small change in core size and material composition affects fiber transmission properties,
such as attenuation and dispersion. When selecting an optical fiber, the system designer decides which
fiber core size and material composition is appropriate.
</p><p class="paragraph">Standard core sizes for multimode step-index fibers are 50 m m and 100 m m. Standard core sizes for
multimode graded-index fibers are 50 m m, 62.5 m m, 85 m m, and 100 m m. Standard core sizes for single
mode fibers are between 8 m m and 10 m m. In most cases, the material used in the preparation of optical
fibers is high-quality glass (SiO2). This glass contains very low amounts of impurities, such as water or
elements other than silica and oxygen. Using high-quality glass produces fibers with low losses. Small
amounts of some elements other than silica and oxygen are added to the glass material to change its index
of refraction. These elements are called material dopants. Silica doped with various materials forms the
refractive index profile of the fiber core and material dopants are discussed in more detail later in this
chapter. Glass is not the only material used in fabrication of optical fibers. Plastics are also used for core
and cladding materials in some applications.
</p><p class="paragraph">A particular optical fiber design can improve fiber optic system performance. Each single mode or

MULTIMODE STEP-INDEX FIBERS
</p><p class="paragraph">A multimode step-index fiber has a core of radius (a) and a constant refractive index n1. A cladding
of slightly lower refractive index n2 surrounds the core. Figure 3-2 shows the refractive index profile n(r)
for this type of fiber. n(r) is equal to n1 at radial distances r &lt;a (core). n(r) is equal to n2 at radial distances
r ÿ a (cladding). Notice the step decrease in the value of refractive index at the core-cladding interface.
This step decrease occurs at a radius equal to distance (a). The difference in the core and cladding
refractive index is the parameter D :

</p><p class="paragraph">The ability of the fiber to accept optical energy from a light source is related to D . D also relates to
the numerical aperture by
</p><p class="paragraph">The number of modes that multimode step-index fibers propagate depends on D and core radius
(a) of the fiber. The number of propagating modes also depends on the wavelength (�) of the transmitted
light. In a typical multimode step-index fiber, there are hundreds of propagating modes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most modes in multimode step-index fibers propagate far from cutoff. Modes that are cut off cease
to be bound to the core of the fiber. Modes that are farther away from the cutoff wavelength concentrate
most of their light energy into the fiber core. Modes that propagate close to cutoff have a greater
percentage of their light energy propagate in the cladding. Since most modes propagate far from cutoff,
the majority of light propagates in the fiber core. Therefore, in multimode step-index fibers, cladding
properties, such as cladding diameter, have limited affect on mode (light) propagation.
</p><p class="paragraph">Multimode step-index fibers have relatively large core diameters and large numerical apertures. A
large core size and a large numerical aperture make it easier to couple light from a light-emitting diode
(LED) into the fiber. Multimode step-index fiber core size is typically 50 m m or 100 m m. Unfortunately,
multimode step-index fibers have limited bandwidth capabilities. Dispersion, mainly modal dispersion,
limits the bandwidth or information-carrying capacity of the fiber. System designers consider each factor
when selecting an appropriate fiber for each particular application.

bandwidth, low-cost applications typically use multimode step-index fibers.

value of the refractive index of the cladding (n2). The value of n1 must be higher than the value of n2 to
allow for proper mode propagation. Like the step-index fiber, the value of n2 is constant and has a slightly
lower value than the maximum value of n1. The relative refractive index difference ( D ) is determined
using the maximum value of n 1 and the value of n2.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-3 shows a possible refractive index profile n(r) for a multimode graded-index fiber. Notice
the parabolic refractive index profile of the core. The profile parameter ( a ) determines the shape of the
core's profile. As the value of a increases, the shape of the core's profile changes from a triangular shape
to step as shown in figure 3-4. Most multimode graded-index fibers have a parabolic refractive index
profile. Multimode fibers with near parabolic graded-index profiles provide the best performance. Unless
otherwise specified, when discussing multimode graded-index fibers, assume that the core's refractive
index profile is parabolic ( a =2).

</p><p class="paragraph">Light propagates in multimode graded-index fibers according to refraction and total internal
reflection. The gradual decrease in the core's refractive index from the center of the fiber causes the light
rays to be refracted many times. The light rays become refracted or curved, which increases the angle of
incidence at the next point of refraction. Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of incidence
becomes larger than the critical angle of incidence. Figure 3-5 shows the process of refraction and total

before reaching the core-cladding interface.
</p><p class="paragraph">The NA of a multimode graded-index fiber is at its maximum value at the fiber axis. This NA is the
axial numerical aperture [NA(0)]. NA(0) is approximately equal to
</p><p class="paragraph">However, the NA for graded-index fibers varies as a function of the radial distance (r). NA varies
because of the refractive index grading in the fiber's core. The NA decreases from the maximum, NA(0),
to zero at distances greater than the core-cladding boundary distance (r&gt;a). The NA, relative refractive
index difference ( D ), profile parameter ( a ), and normalized frequency (V) determine the number of
propagating modes in multimode graded-index fibers. A multimode graded-index fiber with the same
normalized frequency as a multimode step-index fiber will have approximately one-half as many
propagating modes. However, multimode graded-index fibers typically have over one-hundred
propagating modes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Multimode graded-index fibers accept less light than multimode step-index fibers with the same core
D . However, graded-index fibers usually outperform the step-index fibers. The core's parabolic refractive
index profile causes multimode graded-index fibers to have less modal dispersion.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-5 shows possible paths that light may take when propagating in multimode graded-index
fibers. Light rays that travel farther from the fiber's axis travel a longer distance. Light rays that travel
farther from the center travel in core material with an average lower refractive index.
</p><p class="paragraph">In chapter 2, you learned that light travels faster in a material with a lower refractive index.
Therefore, those light rays that travel the longer distance in the lower refractive index parts of the core
travel at a greater average velocity. This means that the rays that travel farther from the fiber's axis will
arrive at each point along the fiber at nearly the same time as the rays that travel close to the fiber's axis.
The decrease in time difference between light rays reduces modal dispersion and increases multimode
graded-index fiber bandwidth. The increased bandwidth allows the use of multimode graded-index fibers
in most applications.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most present day applications that use multimode fiber use graded-index fibers. The basic design
parameters are the fiber's core and cladding size and D . Standard multimode graded-index fiber core and
cladding sizes are 50/125 m m, 62.5/125 m m, 85/125 m m, and 100/140 m m. Each fiber design has a specific</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

multimode graded-index fiber design is appropriate for all applications, the 62.5/125 m m fiber with a D of
0.02 offers the best overall performance.
</p><p class="paragraph">A multimode graded-index fiber's source-to-fiber coupling efficiency and insensitivity to
microbending and macrobending losses are its most distinguishing characteristics. The fiber core size and
D affect the amount of power coupled into the core and loss caused by microbending and macrobending.
Coupled power increases with both core diameter and D , while bending losses increase directly with core
diameter and inversely with D . However, while these values favor high D s, a smaller D improves fiber
bandwidth. In most applications, a multimode graded-index fiber with a core and cladding size of
62.5/125 m m offers the best combination of the following properties:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Relatively high source-to-fiber coupling efficiency

</h3><p class="paragraph">For example, local area network (LAN) and shipboard applications use multimode graded-index
fibers with a core and cladding size of 62.5/125 m m. In LAN-type environments, macrobend and
microbend losses are hard to predict. Cable tension, bends, and local tie-downs increase macrobend and
microbend losses. In shipboard applications, a ship's cable-way may place physical restrictions, such as
tight bends, on the fiber during cable plant installation. The good microbend and macrobend performance
of 62.5/125 m m fiber permits installation of a rugged and robust cable plant. 62.5/125 m mmultimode
graded-index fibers allow for uncomplicated growth because of high fiber bandwidth capabilities for the

Matched cladding means that the fiber cladding consists of a single homogeneous layer of dielectric

</p><p class="paragraph">Single mode step-index fibers propagate only one mode, called the fundamental mode. Single mode
operation occurs when the value of the fiber's normalized frequency is between 0 and 2.405 (0 £ V &lt;
2.405). The value of V should remain near the 2.405 level. When the value of V is less than 1, single
mode fibers carry a majority of the light power in the cladding material. The portion of light transmitted
by the cladding material easily radiates out of the fiber. For example, light radiates out of the cladding
material at fiber bends and splices.
</p><p class="paragraph">Single mode fiber cutoff wavelength is the smallest operating wavelength when single mode fibers
propagate only the fundamental mode. At this wavelength, the 2nd-order mode becomes lossy and
radiates out of the fiber core. As the operating wavelength becomes longer than the cutoff wavelength, the
fundamental mode becomes increasingly lossy. The higher the operating wavelength is above the cutoff
wavelength, the more power is transmitted through the fiber cladding. As the fundamental mode extends
into the cladding material, it becomes increasingly sensitive to bending loss. Single mode fiber designs
include claddings of sufficient thickness with low absorption and scattering properties to reduce
attenuation of the fundamental mode. To increase performance and reduce losses caused by fiber bending
and splicing, fiber manufacturers adjust the value of V. To adjust the value of V, they vary the core and
cladding sizes and relative refractive index difference ( D ).
</p><p class="paragraph">A single mode step-index fiber has low attenuation and high bandwidth properties. Present
applications for single mode fibers include long-haul, high-speed telecommunication systems. Future

performance requirements and cost restraints may prohibit the use of these fibers in certain applications.
Fiber manufacturers modify standard multimode and single mode fiber material composition and
structural design to meet these additional requirements. Optical fiber design can depart from a traditional
circular core and cladding, low-loss glass design. The intent of each change is to increase performance
and reduce cost.

Normally, PCS fibers are cheaper than all-glass fibers but have limited performance characteristics. PCS
fibers lose more light through a plastic cladding than a glass cladding.

FABRICATION OF OPTICAL FIBERS

One method is vapor phase oxidation, and the other method is direct-melt process. In vapor phase
oxidation, gaseous metal halide compounds, dopant material, and oxygen are oxidized (burned) to form a
white silica powder (SiO2). Manufacturers call SiO2 the soot. Manufacturers deposit the soot on the
surface of a glass substrate (mandrel) or inside a hollow tube by one of the following three methods:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Outside Vapor Phase Oxidation (OVPO).
• Inside Vapor Phase Oxidation (IVPO).

</p><p class="paragraph">During vapor phase oxidation, the mandrel or tube continuously moves from side to side and rotates
while soot particles are deposited on the surface. This process forms cylindrical layers of soot on the
surface of the mandrel or inside the hollow tube. This deposited material is transformed into a solid glass
preform by heating the porous material (without melting). The solid preform is then drawn or pulled into
an optical fiber by a process called fiber drawing.
</p><p class="paragraph">The fiber drawing process begins by feeding the glass preform into the drawing furnace. The
drawing furnace softens the end of the preform to the melting point. Manufacturers then pull the softened
preform into a thin glass filament (glass fiber). To protect the bare fiber from contaminants,
manufacturers add an acrylate coating in the draw process. The coating protects the bare fiber from
contaminants such as atmospheric dust and water vapor. Figure 3-11 illustrates the process of drawing an
optical fiber from the preform.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the direct-melt process, multicomponent glass rods form the fiber structure. Rods of
multicomponent glass combine in a molten state to form the fiber core and cladding. The double-crucible
method is the most common direct-melt process. The double-crucible method combines the molten rods
into a single preform using two concentric crucibles. Optical fibers are drawn from this molten glass
using a similar fiber drawing process as in vapor phase oxidation. Figure 3-12 illustrates the double-

</p><p class="paragraph">Navy applications require that fiber optic cables meet stringent design specifications. Fiber optic
cables must be rugged to meet the optical, environmental, and mechanical performance requirements
imposed by Navy systems. Critical system downtime caused by cable failure cannot be tolerated.
However, in commercial applications, the requirements imposed on cable designs are not as stringent.
Each additional requirement imposed on the fiber optic cable design adds to its cost. Cost is always a
main consideration of cable designers in commercial applications. Cost is also considered in Navy
applications, but system reliability is the main goal.

FIBER BUFFERS
</p><p class="paragraph">Coatings and buffers protect the optical fiber from breakage and loss caused by microbends. During
the fiber drawing process, the addition of a primary coating protects the bare glass from abrasions and
other surface contaminants. For additional protection, manufacturers add a layer of buffer material. The
buffer material provides additional mechanical protection for the fiber and helps preserve the fiber's
inherent strength.
</p><p class="paragraph">Manufacturers use a variety of techniques to buffer optical fibers. The types of fiber buffers include
tight-buffered, loose-tube, and gel-filled loose-tube. Figure 3-13 shows each type of fiber buffer. The
choice of buffering techniques depends on the intended application. In large fiber count commercial
applications, manufacturers use the loose-tube buffers. In commercial building and Navy applications,
manufacturers use tight buffers.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic cables use strength members to increase the cables' strength and protect the fiber from
strain. Fiber optic cables may use central support members in cable construction. The central support
members generally have buffered fibers or single fiber sub-cables stranded over their surface in a
structured, helical manner. The central members may support the optical fibers as cable strength members
or may only serve as fillers. Strength and support members must be light and flexible. In commercial
applications, the materials used for strength and support include steel wire and textile fibers (such as
nylon and arimid yarn). They also include carbon fibers, glass fibers, and glass reinforced plastics. For
Navy applications, only non-metallic strength and support members are allowed.
</p><h3 class="subsection">CABLE JACKET, OR SHEATH, MATERIAL

materials for Navy cables have the following properties:

costly. Originally, the production of fire retardant cables included the use of halogenated polymers and
additives. These fire retardant cables were also highly toxic. Commercial jacket materials currently used
include polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane, and polyester elastomers. Most
commercial jacket materials are unsuitable for use in Navy applications. Researchers have developed
jacket materials that are suitable for Navy use.

hung from telephone poles? Is the cable snaked through cableways, submerged in water, or just laid on
the ground? Is the cable used in industrial, telecommunication, utility, or military applications? Each
different application may require a slightly different cable design.
</p><p class="paragraph">Agreement on standard cable designs is difficult. Cable design choices include jacket materials,
water blocking techniques, and the number of fibers to place within the cable. The cable design chosen
depends on the cable's intended application. There are presently many types of fiber optic cables. Some
fiber optic cables are used in commercial applications, while others are used in military applications.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">3-17
</p><p class="paragraph">Standard commercial cable designs will develop over time as fiber optic technology becomes more
established. However, this chapter provides only a short discussion on cable designs considered for Navy
applications.
</p><p class="paragraph">Navy systems require that fiber optic cables meet stringent environmental conditions. The types of
cable designs considered by the Navy include the optical fiber cable component (OFCC), stranded, and
ribbon cable designs. The cable must meet minimal levels of performance in safety (low smoke, low
toxicity, low halogen content, etc.), durability (able to withstand shock, vibration, fluids, etc.), and optical
performance. The cable must also be easy to install and repair. These factors greatly influence the design
of the cables.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Optical Fiber Cable Component (OFCC) Cable
An OFCC cable consists of individual single fiber cables, called optical fiber cable components
</h3><p class="paragraph">(OFCCs). OFCCs are a tight-buffered fiber surrounded by arimid yarn and a low-halogen outer jacket.
The OFCC outer diameter is typically 2 millimeters (mm). The fiber is typically buffered with a polyester
elastomer to a total diameter of 900 m m. Figure 3-14 illustrates the design of the OFCCs. The size of the
OFCCs limits the amount of fibers contained within an OFCC cable. An OFCC cable generally contains
less than 36 fibers (OFCCs). An OFCC cable of 0.5-inch cable outer diameter can accommodate about 12
fibers.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-15 shows an isometric view of a four-fiber shipboard OFCC cable. In this multifiber cable
design, the OFCCs surround a flexible central member in a helical manner. The central member may add
to cable strength or only support the OFCCs. For additional protection, two layers of arimid yarn strength
members encase the OFCC units. These strength members are stranded in opposing lays to minimize
microbending of the fibers. The arimid yarn strength members may be treated with polymers that are
water absorbing, blocking, and sealing. This treatment eliminates the need for additional water blocking
protection. Finally, a low-halogen, flame-resistant outer jacket is extruded over the strength members.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">OFCC cables are easy to handle because each cable contains its own subcable, the OFCC. These
OFCC subcables make it easy to reconfigure systems and handle individual fibers. Rugged OFCC cable
design permits cable use in harsh environments, including Navy applications. OFCC-type cable is
recommended for use in low-density (less than 24 fibers) Navy applications. OFCC-type cable is also
being evaluated for use in Navy applications with fiber counts up to 36 fibers.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Stranded Cable
</h3><p class="paragraph">A stranded cable is a fiber optic cable consisting of buffered fibers stranded down the center of the
cable surrounded by strength members and a protective jacket. Figure 3-16 shows a cross-sectional view
of the stranded cable. The fiber is typically buffered with a polyester elastomer to a total diameter of 900
m m. The recommended use of stranded cables is in medium-density (24 to 72 fibers) Navy applications.
However, this recommendation is preliminary. Further test and evaluation of prototype stranded cable
designs is continuing. Final approval of the stranded cable will occur only after prototype cables have
passed all tests.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Stranded cable designs increase fiber counts without greatly increasing cable size. Stranded cables
are used when fiber counts exceed the limits of OFCC-type cables. For example, the stranded cable
design can accommodate about 48 fibers in a O.5-inch cable. The OFCC cable design can accommodate
around 12 fibers. The individual fiber is not protected as well in the stranded design as in the OFCC
design. For this reason more care is required in handling the individual fibers in the stranded design. The
primary problem of the stranded cable design is in meeting the waterblocking requirements. Once
manufacturers correct this design problem, the Navy expects that the stranded cable design will meet
Navy performance requirements.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Ribbon Cable
</h3><p class="paragraph">A ribbon cable consists of optical fiber ribbons stranded down the center of the cable surrounded by
a protective tube, strength members, and an outer jacket. The fiber optic ribbon consists of multiple-
coated, 250 µ m diameter fibers sandwiched in a plastic material. Figure 3-17 shows a cross-sectional
view of a 12-fiber ribbon. Cable manufacturers stack these ribbons to form a rectangular cross-sectional
array of fibers. Stacked ribbons are the basic building blocks of the ribbon cable. Figure 3-18 illustrates
this cross-sectional array of ribbons. Manufacturers introduce a controlled twist to the stacked ribbons to
minimize fiber stress when the cable is bent. An inner plastic tube, strength members, and an outer
protective jacket surround the stacked ribbons, providing environmental protection.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The ribbon cable design has the highest fiber capacity. Ribbon cables can hold 204 fibers in a
0.5-inch cable. However, ribbon cables have worse bend performance than OFCC and stranded cables.
Ribbon cables also have the poorest waterblocking capabilities of the three cable designs. The bend
performance is expected to worsen if manufacturers add appropriate compounds to increase
waterblocking capabilities.
</p><p class="paragraph">Ribbon cables are also hard to handle. Individual fibers are highly susceptible to damage when
separated from the ribbon. This susceptibility to fiber damage during fiber breakout makes it necessary to
perform multifiber connections. Multifiber connections can introduce single points of failure in multiple
systems. The use of multifiber terminations also introduces maintenance, reconfiguration, and repair
problems. Currently, the Navy does not recommend the use of ribbon cables in shipboard systems.

that you have learned. You should have a thorough understanding of these principles before moving on to
chapter 4.
</p><p class="paragraph">OPTICAL FIBER CLASSIFICATION depends on more than the number of modes that a fiber
can propagate. The optical fiber's refractive index profile and core size further distinguish different types
of single mode and multimode fibers.
</p><p class="paragraph">The REFRACTIVE INDEX PROFILE describes the value of the fiber's refractive index as a
function of axial distance at any fiber diameter.
</p><p class="paragraph">In STEP-INDEX fibers, the refractive index of the core is uniform and undergoes an abrupt change
at the core-cladding boundary.
</p><p class="paragraph">In GRADED-INDEX fibers, the refractive index of the core varies gradually as a function of radial
distance from the fiber center.
</p><p class="paragraph">MULTIMODE STEP-INDEX FIBERS have a core of radius (a), and a constant refractive index
n1. A cladding of slightly lower refractive index n2 surrounds the core.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">D ) is the difference in the core and

D .
</p><p class="paragraph">MULTIMODE STEP-INDEX FIBERS have relatively large core diameters and large numerical
apertures. Unfortunately, multimode step-index fibers have limited bandwidth capabilities and poor bend
performance. Short-haul, limited bandwidth, low-cost applications use multimode step-index fibers.
</p><p class="paragraph">MULTIMODE GRADED-INDEX FIBERS have a core of radius (a). Unlike step-index fibers, the
value of the refractive index of the core (n1) varies according to the radial distance (r). The value of n1
decreases until it approaches the value of the refractive index of the cladding (n2). Like the step-index
fiber, the value of n2 is constant and has a slightly lower refractive index than n1.
</p><p class="paragraph">The PROFILE PARAMETER ( a ) determines the shape of the core's refractive index profile. As
the value of a increases, the shape of the core's profile changes from a triangular shape to a step.
</p><p class="paragraph">The gradual decrease in the core's refractive index from the center of the fiber causes propagating
modes to be refracted many times.
</p><p class="paragraph">Multimode graded-index fibers have lessMODAL DISPERSION than multimode step-index fibers.
Lower modal dispersion means that multimode graded-index fibers have higher bandwidth capabilities
than multimode step-index fibers.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FIBER-OPTIC-CONNECTIONS-4-1-">FIBER OPTIC CONNECTIONS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Chapter 1 states that a fiber optic data link performs three basic functions. First, the data link
transmitter converts an electrical input signal to an optical signal. Then, the optical fiber transmits this
optical signal. Finally, the data link receiver converts the optical signal back to an electrical signal
identical to the original input. However, chapter 1 does not describe how optical power transfers from one
optical component to another.
</p><p class="paragraph">This chapter describes how optical power is transferred from one fiber optic component to another. It
describes how an optical source launches optical power into a fiber as well as how one optical fiber
couples light into another fiber. In fiber optic system design, this launching or coupling of optical power
from one component to the next is important.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic connections permit the transfer of optical power from one component to another. Fiber
optic connections also permit fiber optic systems to be more than just point-to-point data communication
links. In fact, fiber optic data links are often of a more complex design than point-to-point data links.
</p><p class="paragraph">A system connection may require either a fiber optic splice, connector, or coupler. One type of
system connection is a permanent connection made by splicing optical fibers together. A fiber optic splice
makes a permanent joint between two fibers or two groups of fibers. There are two types of fiber optic
splices--mechanical splices and fusion splices. Even though removal of some mechanical splices is
possible, they are intended to be permanent. Another type of connection that allows for system
reconfiguration is a fiber optic connector. Fiber optic connectors permit easy coupling and uncoupling of</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">optical fibers. Fiber optic connectors sometimes resemble familiar electrical plugs and sockets. Systems
may also divide or combine optical signals between fibers. Fiber optic couplers distribute or combine
optical signals between fibers. Couplers can distribute an optical signal from a single fiber into several
fibers. Couplers may also combine optical signals from several fibers into one fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic connection losses may affect system performance. Poor fiber end preparation and poor
fiber alignment are the main causes of coupling loss. Another source of coupling loss is differences in
optical properties between the connected fibers. If the connected fibers have different optical properties,

coupling losses may increase.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OPTICAL-FIBER-COUPLING-LOSS-4-2-">OPTICAL FIBER COUPLING LOSS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Ideally, optical signals coupled between fiber optic components are transmitted with no loss of light.
However, there is always some type of imperfection present at fiber optic connections that causes some
loss of light. It is the amount of optical power lost at fiber optic connections that is a concern of system
designers.
</p><p class="paragraph">The design of fiber optic systems depends on how much light is launched into an optical fiber from
an optical source and how much light is coupled between fiber optic components, such as from one fiber
to another. The amount of power launched from a source into a fiber depends on the optical properties of
both the source and the fiber. The amount of optical power launched into an optical fiber depends on the
radiance of the optical source. An optical source's radiance, or brightness, is a measure of its optical
power launching capability. Radiance is the amount of optical power emitted in a specific direction per
unit time by a unit area of emitting surface. For most types of optical sources, only a fraction of the power
emitted by the source is launched into the optical fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">The loss in optical power through a connection is defined similarly to that of signal attenuation
through a fiber. Optical loss is also a log relationship. The loss in optical power through a connection is
defined as:
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, Po is the power emitted from the source fiber in a fiber-to-fiber connection. Pi is the
power accepted by the connected fiber. In any fiber optic connection, Po and Pi are the optical power
levels measured before and after the joint, respectively.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber-to-fiber connection loss is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic coupling losses. Intrinsic
coupling losses are caused by inherent fiber characteristics. Extrinsic coupling losses are caused by
jointing techniques. Fiber-to-fiber connection loss is increased by the following sources of intrinsic and
extrinsic coupling loss:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

coupling losses are limited by following proper connection procedures.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some fiber optic components are modular devices that are designed to reduce coupling losses
between components. Modular components can be easily inserted or removed from any system. For
example, fiber optic transmitters and receivers are modular components. Fiber optic transmitters and
receivers are devices that are generally manufactured with fiber pigtails or fiber optic connectors as
shown in figure 4-1. A fiber pigtail is a short length of optical fiber (usually 1 meter or less) permanently
fixed to the optical source or detector. Manufacturers supply transmitters and receivers with pigtails and
connectors because fiber coupling to sources and detectors must be completed during fabrication.
Reduced coupling loss results when source-to-fiber and fiber-to-detector coupling is done in a controlled
manufacturing environment. Since optical sources and detectors are pigtailed or connectorized, launching
optical power is reduced to coupling light from one fiber to another. In fact, most fiber optic connections
can be considered fiber-to-fiber.

</h2><p class="paragraph">When optical fibers are connected, optical power may be reflected back into the source fiber. Light
that is reflected back into the source fiber is lost. This reflection loss, called Fresnel reflection, occurs at
every fiber interface. Fresnel reflection is caused by a step change in the refractive index that occurs at
the fiber joint. In most cases, the step change in refractive index is caused by the ends of each fiber being
separated by a small gap. This small gap is usually an air gap. In Fresnel reflection, a small portion of the
incident light is reflected back into the source fiber at the fiber interface. The ratio (R), shown below,
approximates the portion of incident light (light of normal incidence) that is reflected back into the source
fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">R is the fraction of the incident light reflected at the fiber n1 is the refractive index of the fiber core.
n 0 is the refractive index of the medium between the two fibers.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fresnel refraction occurs twice in a fiber-to-fiber connection. A portion of the optical power is
reflected when the light first exits the source fiber. Light is then reflected as the optical signal enters the
receiving fiber. Fresnel reflection at each interface must be taken into account when calculating the total
fiber-to-fiber coupling loss. Loss from Fresnel reflection may be significant. To reduce the amount of loss
from Fresnel reflection, the air gap can be filled with an index matching gel. The refractive index of the
index matching gel should match the refractive index of the fiber core. Index matching gel reduces the
step change in the refractive index at the fiber interface, reducing Fresnel reflection.
</p><p class="paragraph">In any system, index matching gels can be used to eliminate or reduce Fresnel reflection. The choice
of index matching gels is important. Fiber-to-fiber connections are designed to be permanent and require
no maintenance. Over the lifetime of the fiber connection, the index matching material must meet specific
optical and mechanical requirements. Index matching gels should remain transparent. They should also
resist flowing or dripping by remaining viscous. Some index matching gels darken over time while others
settle or leak out of fiber connections. If these requirements are not met, then the fiber-to-fiber connection
loss will increase over time. In Navy applications, this variation in connection loss over time is
unacceptable. In Navy systems, index matching gels are only used in fiber optic splice interfaces.

three basic coupling errors that occur during fiber alignment are fiber separation (longitudinal
misalignment), lateral misalignment, and angular misalignment. Most alignment errors are the result of
mechanical imperfections introduced by fiber jointing techniques. However, alignment errors do result
from installers not following proper connection procedures.

</p><p class="paragraph">Angular misalignment occurs when the axes of two connected fibers are no longer parallel. The
axes of each fiber intersect at some angle ( Q ). Figure 4-4 illustrates the angular misalignment between the
core axes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Coupling loss caused by lateral and angular misalignment typically is greater than the loss caused by
fiber separation. Loss, caused by fiber separation, is less critical because of the relative ease in limiting
the distance of fiber separation. However, in some cases, fiber optic connectors prevent fibers from actual
contact. These fiber optic connectors separate the fibers by a small gap. This gap eliminates damage to
fiber-end faces during connection. For connectors with an air gap, the use of index matching gel reduces
the coupling loss.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most newer connectors are designed so that the connector ferrule end faces contact when the
connector is mated. The connector can be assembled onto the fiber so that the fibers also contact when
mated. However, they also can be assembled so that the fibers do not. Whether or not the fibers contact is
determined by whether the fiber sticks out slightly from the ferrule or is recessed inside the ferrule. The
fiber position can be controlled by the connector polishing technique. The physical contact (PC) polish
technique was developed for most connectors so that the fibers would touch when mated. In these types of
connectors, index gel is not needed to reduce reflections.
</p><p class="paragraph">While index matching gel reduces coupling loss from fiber separation, it does not affect loss in
lateral misalignment. Additionally, index matching gel usually increases the fiber's coupling loss
sensitivity to angular misalignment. Although angular misalignment involves fiber separation, index
matching gel reduces the angle at which light is launched from the source fiber. Index matching gel
causes less light to be coupled into the receiving fiber. To reduce coupling loss from angular
misalignment, the angle Q should be less than 1º.
</p><p class="paragraph">Coupling losses due to fiber alignment depend on fiber type, core diameter, and the distribution of
optical power among propagating modes. Fibers with large NAs reduce loss from angular misalignment
and increase loss from fiber separation. Single mode fibers are more sensitive to alignment errors than
multimode fibers because of their small core size. However, alignment errors in multimode fiber</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">In fiber-to-fiber connections, a source of extrinsic coupling loss is poor fiber end preparation. An
optical fiber-end face must be flat, smooth, and perpendicular to the fiber's axis to ensure proper fiber
connection. Light is reflected or scattered at the connection interface unless the connecting fiber end faces
are properly prepared. Figure 4-5 shows some common examples of poor fiber ends. It illustrates a fiber-
end face tilt, lip, and hackle. Quality fiber-end preparation is essential for proper system operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber-end preparation begins by removing the fiber buffer and coating material from the end of the
optical fiber. Removal of these materials involves the use of mechanical strippers or chemical solvents.
When using chemical solvents, the removal process must be performed in a well-ventilated area. For this
reason mechanical strippers are used for buffer and coating removal in the shipboard environment. After
removing the buffer and coating material, the surface of the bare fiber is wiped clean using a wiping
tissue. The wiping tissue must be wet with isopropyl alcohol before wiping.

outer surface of the optical fiber and then placing it under tension until it breaks. A heavy metal or
diamond blade is used to score the fiber. Once the scoring process is complete, fiber tension is increased
until the fiber breaks. The fiber is placed under tension either by pulling on the fiber or by bending the
fiber over a curved surface.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-6 shows the setup for the score-and-break procedure for fiber cleaving. Under constant
tension, the score-and-break method for cleaving fibers produces a quality fiber end. This fiber end is
good enough to use for some splicing techniques. However, additional fiber-end preparation is necessary
to produce reliable low-loss connections when using fiber optic connectors.
</p><p class="paragraph">Polishing the fiber ends removes most surface imperfections introduced by the fiber cleaving
process. Fiber polishing begins by inserting the cleaved fiber into the ferrule of a connector assembly. A
ferrule is a fixture, generally a rigid tube, used to hold the stripped end of an optical fiber in a fiber optic
connector. An individual fiber is epoxied within the ferrule. The connector with the optical fiber
cemented within the ferrule can then be mounted into a special polishing tool for polishing.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-7 shows one type of fiber polishing tool for finishing optical fibers in a connector assembly.
Various types of connector assemblies are discussed later in this chapter. In this type of polishing tool, the
connector assembly is threaded onto the polishing tool. The connector ferrule passes through the center of
the tool allowing the fiber-end face to extend below the tool's circular, flat bottom. The optical fiber is
now ready for polishing.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

core ellipticity, and core-cladding concentricity differences. Figure 4-8 illustrates each type of optical and
geometrical fiber mismatch. Navy fiber specifications tightly specify these parameters to minimize
coupling losses from fiber mismatches.
</p><p class="paragraph">Core diameter and NA mismatch have a greater effect on intrinsic coupling loss than the other types
of fiber mismatches. In multimode fiber connections, the coupling loss resulting from core diameter
mismatch, NA mismatch, and refractive index profile difference depends on the characteristics of the
launching fiber. Coupling loss from core diameter mismatch results only if the launching fiber has a
larger core radius (a) than the receiving fiber. Coupling loss from NA mismatch results only if the

difference results only if the launching fiber has a larger profile parameter ( a ) than the receiving fiber.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A fiber optic splice is a permanent fiber joint whose purpose is to establish an optical connection
between two individual optical fibers. System design may require that fiber connections have specific
optical properties (low loss) that are met only by fiber-splicing. Fiber optic splices also permit repair of
optical fibers damaged during installation, accident, or stress. System designers generally require fiber
splicing whenever repeated connection or disconnection is unnecessary or unwanted.
</p><p class="paragraph">Mechanical and fusion splicing are two broad categories that describe the techniques used for fiber
splicing. Amechanical splice is a fiber splice where mechanical fixtures and materials perform fiber
alignment and connection. A fusion splice is a fiber splice where localized heat fuses or melts the ends of
two optical fibers together. Each splicing technique seeks to optimize splice performance and reduce
splice loss. Low-loss fiber splicing results from proper fiber end preparation and alignment.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber splice alignment can involve passive or active fiber core alignment. Passive alignment relies on
precision reference surfaces, either grooves or cylindrical holes, to align fiber cores during splicing.
Active alignment involves the use of light for accurate fiber alignment. Active alignment may consist of
either monitoring the loss through the splice during splice alignment or by using a microscope to
accurately align the fiber cores for splicing. To monitor loss either an optical source and optical power
meter or an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) are used. Active alignment procedures produce
low-loss fiber splices.

Mechanical splicing methods may involve either passive or active core alignment. Active core alignment
produces a lower loss splice than passive alignment. However, passive core alignment methods can
produce mechanical splices with acceptable loss measurements even with single mode fibers.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the strictest sense, a mechanical splice is a permanent connection made between two optical
fibers. Mechanical splices hold the two optical fibers in alignment for an indefinite period of time without
movement. The amount of splice loss is stable over time and unaffected by changes in environmental or
mechanical conditions.
</p><p class="paragraph">If high splice loss results from assembling some mechanical splices, the splice can be reopened and
the fibers realigned. Realignment includes wiping the fiber or ferrule end with a soft wipe, reinserting the
fiber or ferrule in a new arrangement, and adding new refractive index material. Once producing an
acceptable mechanical splice, splice realignment should be unnecessary because most mechanical splices
are environmentally and mechanically stable within their intended application.

transparent adhesive, injected into the tube, bonds the two fibers together. The adhesive also provides
index matching between the optical fibers. Figure 4-9 illustrates fiber alignment using a glass or ceramic
tube. This splicing technique relies on the inner diameter of the alignment tube. If the inner diameter is

impossible to insert the fiber into the tube.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FUSION-SPLICES-4-14-">FUSION SPLICES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The process of fusion splicing involves using localized heat to melt or fuse the ends of two optical
fibers together. The splicing process begins by preparing each fiber end for fusion. Fusion splicing
requires that all protective coatings be removed from the ends of each fiber. The fiber is then cleaved
using the score-and-break method. The quality of each fiber end is inspected using a microscope. In
fusion splicing, splice loss is a direct function of the angles and quality of the two fiber-end faces.
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic fusion splicing apparatus consists of two fixtures on which the fibers are mounted and two
electrodes. Figure 4-13 shows a basic fusion-splicing apparatus. An inspection microscope assists in the
placement of the prepared fiber ends into a fusion-splicing apparatus. The fibers are placed into the
apparatus, aligned, and then fused together. Initially, fusion splicing used nichrome wire as the heating
element to melt or fuse fibers together. New fusion-splicing techniques have replaced the nichrome wire
with carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers, electric arcs, or gas flames to heat the fiber ends, causing them to fuse
together. The small size of the fusion splice and the development of automated fusion-splicing machines
have made electric arc fusion (arc fusion) one of the most popular splicing techniques in commercial
applications.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Arc fusion involves the discharge of electric current across a gap between two electrodes. By placing
the fiber ends between the electrodes, the electric discharge melts or fuses the ends of each fiber. Figure
4-13 shows the placement of the fiber ends between tungsten electrodes during arc fusion. Initially, a
small gap is present between the fiber ends. A short discharge of electric current is used to prepare the
fiber ends for fusion. During this short discharge, known as prefusion, the fiber ends are cleaned and
rounded to eliminate any surface defects that remain from fiber cleaving. Surface defects can cause core
distortions or bubble formations during fiber fusion. A fusion splice results when the fiber ends are
pressed together, actively aligned, and fused using a longer and stronger electric discharge. Automated
fusion splicers typically use built-in local optical power launch/detection schemes for aligning the fibers.
</p><p class="paragraph">During fusion, the surface tension of molten glass tends to realign the fibers on their outside
diameters, changing the initial alignment. When the fusion process is complete, a small core distortion
may be present. Small core distortions have negligible effects on light propagating through multimode
fibers. However, a small core distortion can significantly affect single mode fiber splice loss. The core
distortion, and the splice loss, can be reduced by limiting the arc discharge and decreasing the gap
distance between the two electrodes. This limits the region of molten glass. However, limiting the region
of molten glass reduces the tensile strength of the splice.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fusion splicing yields typically vary between 25 and 75 percent depending on the strength and loss
requirements for the splice and other factors. Other factors affecting splice yields include the condition of
the splicing machine, the experience of the splice personnel, and environmental conditions. Since fusion
splicing is inherently permanent, an unacceptable fusion splice requires breakage and refabrication of the
splice.
</p><p class="paragraph">In general, fusion splicing takes a longer time to complete than mechanical splicing. Also, yields are
typically lower making the total time per successful splice much longer for fusion splicing. Both the yield
and splice time are determined to a large degree by the expertise of the fusion splice operator. Fusion
splice operators must be highly trained to consistently make low-loss reliable fusion splices. For these
reasons the fusion splice is not recommended for use in Navy shipboard applications.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Normally, multifiber splices are only installed on ribbon type fiber optic cables. Multifiber splicing
techniques can use arc fusion to restore connection, but most splicing techniques use mechanical splicing
methods. The most common mechanical splice is the ribbon splice.
</p><p class="paragraph">A ribbon splice uses an etched silicon chip, or grooved substrate, to splice the multiple fibers within
a flat ribbon. The spacing between the etched grooves of the silicon chip is equal to the spacing between
the fibers in the flat ribbon. Before placing each ribbon on the etched silicon chip, each fiber within the
ribbon cable is cleaved. All of the fibers are placed into the grooves and held in place with a flat cover.
Typically, an index matching gel is used to reduce the splice loss. Figure 4-14 shows the placement of the
fiber ribbon on the etched silicon chip.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FIBER-OPTIC-CONNECTORS-4-17-">FIBER OPTIC CONNECTORS
</h2><p class="paragraph">A fiber optic connector is a demateable device that permits the coupling of optical power between
two optical fibers or two groups of fibers. Designing a device that allows for repeated fiber coupling
without significant loss of light is difficult. Fiber optic connectors must maintain fiber alignment and
provide repeatable loss measurements during numerous connections. Fiber optic connectors should be
easy to assemble (in a laboratory or field environment) and should be cost effective. They should also be
reliable. Fiber optic connections using connectors should be insensitive to environmental conditions, such
as temperature, dust, and moisture. Fiber optic connector designs attempt to optimize connector
performance by meeting each of these conditions.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic connector coupling loss results from the same loss mechanisms described earlier in this
chapter. Coupling loss results from poor fiber alignment and end preparation (extrinsic losses), fiber
mismatches (intrinsic loss), and Fresnel reflection. The total amount of insertion loss for fiber optic
connectors should remain below 1 dB. Fiber alignment is the critical parameter in maintaining the total
insertion loss below the required level. There is only a small amount of control over coupling loss
resulting from fiber mismatches, because the loss results from inherent fiber properties. Index matching
gels cannot be used to reduce Fresnel losses, since the index matching gels attract dust and dirt to the
connection.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic connectors can also reduce system performance by introducing modal and reflection
noise. The cause of modal noise in fiber optic connectors is the interfering of the different wavefronts of
different modes within the fiber at the connector interface. Modal noise is eliminated by using only single
mode fiber with laser sources and only low-coherence sources such as light-emitting diodes with
multimode fiber. Fiber optic connectors can introduce reflection noise by reflecting light back into the
optical source. Reflection noise is reduced by index matching gels, physical contact polishes, or
antireflection coatings. Generally, reflection noise is only a problem in high data rate single mode systems
using lasers.
</p><p class="paragraph">Butt-jointed connectors and expanded-beam connectors are the two basic types of fiber optic
connectors. Fiber optic butt-jointed connectors align and bring the prepared ends of two fibers into close
contact. The end-faces of some butt-jointed connectors touch, but others do not depending upon the
connector design. Types of butt-jointed connectors include cylindrical ferrule and biconical connectors.
Fiber optic expanded-beam connectors use two lenses to first expand and then refocus the light from the
transmitting fiber into the receiving fiber. Single fiber butt-jointed and expanded beam connectors
normally consist of two plugs and an adapter (coupling device). Figure 4-15 shows how to configure each
plug and adapter when making the connection between two optical fibers.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Ferrule connectors use two cylindrical plugs (referred to as ferrules), an alignment sleeve, and
sometimes axial springs to perform fiber alignment. Figure 4-16 provides an illustration of this basic
ferrule connector design. Precision holes drilled or molded through the center of each ferrule allow for
fiber insertion and alignment. Precise fiber alignment depends on the accuracy of the central hole of each
ferrule. When the fiber ends are inserted, an adhesive (normally an epoxy resin) bonds the fiber inside the
ferrule. The fiber-end faces are polished until they are flush with the end of the ferrule to achieve a low-
loss fiber connection. Fiber alignment occurs when the ferrules are inserted into the alignment sleeve. The
inside diameter of the alignment sleeve aligns the ferrules, which in turn align the fibers. Ferrule
connectors lock the ferrules in the alignment sleeve using a threaded outer shell or some other type of
coupling mechanism.
</p><p class="paragraph">As stated before, fiber alignment depends on an accurate hole through the center of the ferrule.
Normally, ferrule connectors use ceramic or metal ferrules. The center hole is generally drilled in a metal
ferrule. Drilling an accurate hole through the entire metal ferrule can be difficult. To improve fiber
alignment, some metal ferrule connectors use precision watch-jeweled centering. In precision watch-
jeweled centering, a watch jewel with a precision centered hole is placed in the tip of the ferrule. The</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

watch jewel provides for better fiber alignment, because regulating the hole tolerance of the watch jewel
is easier than maintaining a precise hole diameter when drilling through an entire ferrule.
</p><p class="paragraph">The center hole in a ceramic ferrule is created by forming the ferrule around a precision wire, which
is then removed. This method produces holes accurately centered in the ferrule. Most cylindrical ferrule
connectors now use ceramic ferrules. The Straight Tip (STÒ connector is an example of a ceramic ferrule
connector. (ST is a registered trademark of AT&amp;T.)
</p><p class="paragraph">Other cylindrical ferrule connectors have a ferrule that contains both metal and ceramic. For these
connectors a ceramic capillary is placed within the tip of a metal ferrule to provide for precision fiber
alignment. The ceramic capillary is a ceramic tube with a small inner diameter that is just larger than the
diameter of the fiber. Figure 4-17 shows the placement of the ceramic capillary within the metal ferrule.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another type of butt-jointed connector is the biconical connector. Biconical connectors use two
conical plugs, a double conical alignment sleeve, and axial springs to perform fiber alignment. Figure
4-18 is an illustration of this basic biconical connector design. Formation of the plugs and alignment
sleeve involves transfer molding. Transfer molding uses silica-filled epoxy resin to mold the conical plug
directly to the fiber or around a cast (precision wire). After connecting the conical plugs to the optical
fibers, the fiber-end faces are polished before the plugs are inserted into the molded alignment sleeve.
During fiber insertion, the inside surface of the double conical sleeve performs fiber alignment, while the
axial springs push the fiber ends into close contact. If the alignment sleeve permits the fibers to actually
become in contact, then the axial spring provides enough force to maintain fiber contact but prevent
damage to the fiber-end faces. Normally, biconical connectors lock the fibers in alignment using a
threaded outer shell.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

fibers. One type of multifiber connector is the array connector. The array connector is used to connect
individual ribbons of ribbon-type cables. The array connector is similar to the ribbon splice. In the array
connector, the fibers of each ribbon are epoxied into grooves of a silicon chip so that the fiber ends
protrude from the end of the chip. The chip and the protruding fibers are polished flat for connection.
Each half of the connector is prepared separately before being butt-jointed. A spring clip and two grooved
metal-backed plates are used to align and connect the stacked ribbons of the two ribbon cables. Array
connectors may also use an alignment sleeve with V-grooved silicon chips and metal springs to align and
connect stacked ribbons. Figure 4-19 shows the spring clip method of array connector alignment. The

beam coupling than in butt-jointing. The same amount of fiber separation and lateral misalignment in
expanded beam coupling produces a lower coupling loss than in butt-jointing. However, angular
misalignment is more critical. The same amount of angular misalignment in expanded-beam coupling

fibers into a single fiber. Fiber optic couplers attenuate the signal much more than a connector or splice
because the input signal is divided among the output ports. For example, with a 1 · 2 fiber optic coupler,
each output is less than one-half the power of the input signal (over a 3 dB loss).

optic connections also permit fiber optic systems to be more than just a point-to-point data link.
</p><p class="paragraph">A FIBER OPTIC SPLICE is a permanent joint between two fibers or two groups of fibers.

</p><p class="paragraph">RADIANCE is the amount of optical power emitted by a unit area of emitting surface per unit time
in a specified direction. An optical source's radiance, or brightness, is a measure of its optical power
launching capability.
</p><p class="paragraph">FIBER-TO-FIBER COUPLING LOSS is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic coupling losses.
INTRINSIC COUPLING LOSSES are caused by inherent fiber characteristics. EXTRINSIC
COUPLING LOSSES are caused by jointing techniques.
</p><p class="paragraph">A FIBER PIGTAIL is a short length of optical fiber (usually 1 meter or less) permanently fixed to a
fiber optic component, such as an optical source or detector.
</p><p class="paragraph">FRESNEL REFLECTION occurs twice in a fiber-to-fiber connection. A portion of the optical
power is reflected when the light first exits the source fiber. Light is then reflected as the optical signal
enters the receiving fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">INDEX MATCHING GEL eliminates or reduces the step change in the refractive index at the fiber
interface, reducing Fresnel reflection.
</p><p class="paragraph">POOR FIBER ALIGNMENT is a main source of coupling loss in fiber-to-fiber connections. The
three basic coupling errors that occur during fiber alignment are fiber separation (longitudinal
misalignment), lateral misalignment, and angular misalignment.
</p><p class="paragraph">In FIBER SEPARATION a small gap remains between fiber-end faces after completing the fiber
connection. LATERAL, or AXIAL,MISALIGNMENT is when the axes of the two fibers are offset in
a perpendicular direction. ANGULARMISALIGNMENT is when the axes of the two fibers are no
longer parallel.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">SINGLE MODE FIBERS are more sensitive to alignment errors than multimode fibers because of
their small core diameters and low numerical apertures.
</p><p class="paragraph">TheMODE POWER DISTRIBUTION (MPD) is the distribution of radiant power among the
various modes propagating along the optical fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">Poor FIBER END PREPARATION is another source of extrinsic coupling loss. An optical fiber
end face must be flat, smooth, and perpendicular to the fiber's axis to ensure proper fiber connection.
</p><p class="paragraph">The SCORE-AND-BREAK method is the basic fiber cleaving technique for preparing optical fibers
for coupling.
</p><p class="paragraph">POLISHING the fiber ends removes most surface imperfections introduced by the fiber cleaving or
cutting process. Fiber polishing involves a step-down approach. The first step is to give the surface of the
fiber end a rough polish. The next step involves giving the surface of the fiber end a fine polish.
</p><p class="paragraph">FIBER MISMATCHES are a source of intrinsic coupling loss. Types of fiber mismatches include
fiber geometry mismatches, NA mismatch, and refractive index profile difference.
</p><p class="paragraph">FIBER GEOMETRY MISMATCHES include core diameter, cladding diameter, core ellipticity,
and core-cladding concentricity differences.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

fiber has a larger profile parameter than the receiving fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">MECHANICAL and FUSION SPLICING are two broad categories that describe the techniques
used for fiber splicing. A mechanical splice is a fiber splice where mechanical fixtures perform fiber
alignment and connection. A fusion splice is a fiber splice where localized heat fuses or melts the ends of
two lengths of optical fiber together.
</p><p class="paragraph">InMECHANICAL SPLICING, mechanical fixtures hold the two optical fibers in alignment for an
indefinite period of time without movement. The amount of splice loss is stable over time and unaffected
by changes in environmental or mechanical conditions.
</p><p class="paragraph">ARC FUSION involves the discharge of electric current across a gap between two electrodes. By
placing the fiber end between the electrodes, the electric discharge melts or fuses the ends of the fibers.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

prefusion the fiber ends are cleaned and rounded to eliminate any surface defects that remain from fiber
cleaving.
</p><p class="paragraph">A FIBER OPTIC CONNECTOR is a demateable device that permits the coupling of optical power
between two optical fibers or two groups of fibers.
</p><p class="paragraph">FIBER ALIGNMENT in a fiber optic connector is the critical parameter in maintaining total
insertion loss below the required level.
</p><p class="paragraph">FIBER OPTIC CONNECTORS can affect system performance by increasing modal and reflection
noise.
</p><p class="paragraph">MODAL NOISE is eliminated by using only single mode fiber with laser sources and only low-
coherence sources such as light-emitting diodes with multimode fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">REFLECTION NOISE is reduced by index matching gels, physical contact polishes, or
antireflection coatings.
</p><p class="paragraph">BUTT-JOINTED and EXPANDED BEAM CONNECTORS are two ways to classify fiber optic
connectors. Butt-jointed connectors bring the prepared ends of two fibers into close contact. Expanded
beam connectors use two lenses to first expand and then refocus the light from the transmitting fiber into
the receiving fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">LIGHT-DUTY and HEAVY-DUTY CONNECTORS are two ways that the Navy classifies fiber
optic connectors. Light-duty connector shipboard applications include locations that protect the
connectors from the environment such as in a junction box. Heavy-duty applications require a very
rugged, stand-alone, sealed connector.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic data links operate reliably if fiber optic component manufacturers and end users perform
the necessary laboratory and field measurements. Manufacturers must test how component designs,
material properties, and fabrication techniques affect the performance of fiber optic components. These
tests can be categorized as design tests or quality control tests. Design tests are conducted during the
development of a component. Design tests characterize the component's performance (optical,
mechanical, and environmental) in the intended application. Once the component performance is
characterized, the manufacturer generally only conducts quality control tests. Quality control tests verify
that the parts produced are the same as the parts the design tests were conducted on. When manufacturers
ship fiber optic components, they provide quality control data detailing the results of measurements
performed during or after component fabrication.
</p><p class="paragraph">End users (equipment manufacturers, shipbuilders, maintenance personnel, test personnel, and so on)
should measure some of these parameters upon receipt before installing the component into the fiber optic
data link. These tests determine if the component has been damaged in the shipping process. In addition,
end users should measure some component parameters after installing or repairing fiber optic components
in the field. The values obtained can be compared to the system installation specifications. These
measurements determine if the installation or repair process has degraded component performance and
will affect data link operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">Whenever a measurement is made, it should be made using a standard measurement procedure. For

measurements that are important to system operation. The list of optical fiber and optical connection
laboratory measurements described in this chapter includes the following:

Attenuation
</p><p class="paragraph">Attenuation is the loss of optical power as light travels along the fiber. It is a result of absorption,
scattering, bending, and other loss mechanisms as described in chapter 3. Each loss mechanism
contributes to the total amount of fiber attenuation.

</p><p class="paragraph">CUTBACK METHOD.—In laboratory situations, end users perform the cutback method for
measuring the total attenuation of an optical fiber. The cutback method involves comparing the optical
power transmitted through a long piece of test fiber to the power present at the beginning of the fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">The cutback method for measuring multimode fiber attenuation is EIA/TIA-455-46. The cutback
method for measuring single mode fiber attenuation is EIA/TIA-455-78. The basic measurement process
is the same for both of these procedures. The test method requires that the test fiber of known length (L)
be cut back to an approximate 2-m length. This cut back causes the destruction of 2-m of fiber. This
method requires access to both fiber ends. Each fiber end should be properly prepared to make
measurements. EIA/TIA-455-57 describes how to properly prepare fiber ends for measurement purposes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 5-1 illustrates the cutback method for measuring fiber attenuation. The cutback method
begins by measuring, with an optical power meter, the output power P1 of the test fiber of known length
(L) (figure 5-1, view A). Without disturbing the input light conditions, the test fiber is cut back to an
approximate 2-m length. The output power P2 of the shortened test fiber is then measured (figure 5-1,
view B). The fiber attenuation AT and the attenuation coefficient a are then calculated.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">LAUNCH CONDITIONS.—Measurement personnel must pay attention to how optical power is
launched into the fiber when measuring fiber attenuation. Different distributions of launch power (launch
conditions) can result in different attenuation measurements. This is more of a problem with multimode
fiber than single mode fiber. For single mode fiber, optical power must be launched only into the
fundamental mode. This is accomplished using a mode filter on the fiber. For multimode fiber, the
distribution of power among the modes of the fiber must be controlled. This is accomplished by
controlling the launch spot size and angular distribution.
</p><p class="paragraph">The launch spot size is the area of the fiber face illuminated by the light beam from the optical
source. The diameter of the spot depends on the size of the optical source and the properties of the optical
elements (lenses, and so on) between the source and the fiber end face. The angular distribution is the
angular extent of the light beam from the optical source incident on the fiber end face. The launch angular
distribution also depends on the size of the optical source and the properties of the optical elements
between the optical source and the fiber end face.
</p><p class="paragraph">Multimode optical fiber launch conditions are typically characterized as being underfilled or
overfilled. An underfilled launch concentrates most of the optical power in the center of the fiber. An
underfilled launch results when the launch spot size and angular distribution are smaller than that of the
fiber core. Underfilling the fiber excites mainly low-order modes. Figure 5-2 illustrates an underfilled
launch condition.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Overfilling the fiber excites both low-order and high-order modes. Figure 5-3 illustrates an overfilled
launch condition. An overfilled launch condition occurs when the launch spot size and angular
distribution are larger than that of the fiber core. Incident light that falls outside the fiber core is lost. In
addition, light that is incident at angles greater than the angle of acceptance of the fiber core is lost.
</p><p class="paragraph">In attenuation measurements, cladding-mode strippers and mode filters eliminate the effects that
high-order modes have on attenuation results. A cladding-mode stripper is a device that removes any
cladding mode power from the fiber. Most cladding-mode strippers consist of a material with a refractive</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

cladding-mode stripper.
</p><p class="paragraph">Amode filter is a device that attenuates specific modes propagating in the core of an optical fiber.
Mode filters generally involve wrapping the test fiber around a mandrel. For multimode, tight bends tend
to remove high-order modes from the fiber. This type of mode filter is known as amandrel wrap mode
filter. For multimode fibers, mode filters remove high-order propagating modes and are individually
tailored and adjusted for a specific fiber type.
</p><p class="paragraph">For single mode fibers, a mode filter is used to eliminate the second-order mode from propagating
along the fiber. The propagation of the second-order mode will affect attenuation measurements. Fiber
attenuation caused by the second-order mode depends on the operating wavelength, the fiber bend radius
and length.
</p><p class="paragraph">The two most common types of mode filters are free-form loops and mandrel wraps. Figure 5-4
illustrates the free-form loop and mandrel-wrap types of mode filters. Mandrel wraps for multimode
fibers consist of several wraps (approximately 4 or 5) around a mandrel. A 20-mm diameter mandrel is
typically used for 62.5 m m fiber. Mandrel wraps for single mode fibers consist of a single wrap around a
30-mm diameter mandrel. Another common mode filter for single mode fibers is a 30-mm diameter
circular free-form loop. Additional information on multimode and single mode filters (and launch
conditions) is available in EIA/TIA-455-50 and EIA/TIA-455-77, respectively.
</p><p class="paragraph">Launch conditions significantly affect the results of multimode fiber attenuation measurements. If
the fiber is underfilled, high-order-mode power loss has minimal effect on the measurement results. If too
much power is launched into high-order modes, the high-order-mode power loss will dominate the
attenuation results. Generally, fiber attenuation measurements are performed using an underfilled launch</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

fiber. What mode propagating along single mode fibers do mode filters eliminate?
</p><p class="question">Q8. What are the two most common types of mode filters?
Cutoff Wavelength
</p><p class="paragraph">The wavelength at which a mode ceases to propagate is called the cutoff wavelength for that mode.
However, an optical fiber is always able to propagate at least one mode, the fundamental mode. The
fundamental mode can never be cut off. The cutoff wavelength of a single mode fiber is the wavelength
above which the fiber propagates only the fundamental mode.
</p><p class="paragraph">Determining the cutoff wavelength of a single mode fiber involves finding the wavelength above
which the power transmitted through the fiber decreased abruptly. This power decrease occurs when the
second-order mode propagating in the fiber is cut off. The cutoff wavelength of single mode fibers
depends on the fiber length and bend conditions. The effects of length and bending are different on
different fibers depending on whether they are matched-clad or depressed-clad in design. The cutoff
wavelength of matched-clad fibers is more sensitive to bends than the cutoff wavelength of depressed-
clad fibers. The cutoff wavelength of depressed-clad fibers is more sensitive to length than the cutoff
wavelength of matched-clad fibers.
</p><p class="paragraph">Cutoff wavelength may be measured on uncabled or cabled single mode fibers. A slightly different
procedure is used in each case, but the basic measurement process is the same. The test method for
uncabled single mode fiber cutoff wavelength is EIA/TIA-455-80. The test method for cabled single
mode fiber cutoff wavelength is EIA/TIA-455-170. The fiber cutoff wavelength (l ) measured under
EIA/TIA-455-80 will generally be higher than the cable cutoff wavelength ( l ) measured under EIA/TIA-
455-170. The difference is due to the fiber bends introduced during the cable manufacturing process.
</p><p class="paragraph">Each test method describes the test equipment (input optics, mode filters, and cladding-mode
strippers) necessary for the test. Cutoff wavelength measurements require an overfilled launch over the
full range of test wavelengths. Since the procedures for measuring the cutoff wavelength of uncabled and
cabled single mode fibers are essentially the same, only the test method for measuring the cutoff
wavelength of uncabled fiber is discussed.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

that of a reference fiber at different wavelengths. The reference fiber can be the same piece of single
mode fiber with small bends introduced or a piece of multimode fiber. If the same fiber with small bends
is used as the reference fiber, the technique is called the bend-reference technique. If a piece of
multimode fiber is used as the reference fiber, the technique is called the multimode-reference
technique.
</p><p class="paragraph">For both techniques, the test fiber is loosely supported in a single-turn with a constant radius of 140
mm. Figure 5-5 shows this single-turn configuration. The transmitted signal power Ps ( l ) is then recorded
while scanning the wavelength range in increments of 10 nm or less. The launch and detection conditions
are not changed while scanning over the range of wavelengths. The wavelength range scanned
encompasses the expected cutoff wavelength.
</p><p class="paragraph">The reference power measurement is then made. For the bend-reference technique, the launch and
detection conditions are not changed, but an additional bend is added to the test fiber. The test fiber is
bent to a radius of 30 mm or less to suppress the second-order mode at all the scanned wavelengths. For
the multimode-reference technique, the single mode fiber is replaced with a 2-m length of multimode
fiber. The transmitted signal power Pr ( l ) is recorded while scanning the same wavelength range in the

</p><h3 class="subsection">Bandwidth
</h3><p class="paragraph">Dispersion reduces the bandwidth, or information-carrying capacity, of an optical fiber. Dispersion
causes the spreading of the light pulse as it travels along the fiber (see figure 2-20). Fiber dispersion
mechanisms include intramodal (chromatic) dispersion and intermodal (modal) dispersion. Multimode
fiber bandwidth is a measure of the intermodal dispersion of the multimode fiber.
</p><p class="paragraph">Intermodal dispersion is maximum when all fiber modes are excited. The source used for intermodal
dispersion measurements must overfill the fiber. The optical source must also have a narrow spectral
width to reduce the effects of chromatic dispersion in the measurement.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two basic techniques for measuring the modal bandwidth of an optical fiber. The first
technique characterizes dispersion by measuring the impulse response h(t) of the fiber in the time
domain. The second technique characterizes modal dispersion by measuring the baseband frequency
response H(f) of the fiber in the frequency domain. H(f) is the power transfer function of the fiber at the
baseband frequency (f). H(f) is also the Fourier transform of the power impulse response h(t). Only the
frequency response method is described here.
</p><p class="paragraph">The test method for measuring the bandwidth of multimode fibers in the frequency domain is
EIA/TIA-455-30. Signals of varying frequencies (f) are launched into the test fiber and the power exiting
the fiber at the launched fundamental frequency measured. This optical output power is denoted as Pout(f).
The test fiber is then cut back or replaced with a short length of fiber of the same type. Signals of the
same frequency are launched into the cut-back fiber and the power exiting the cut-back fiber at the
launched fundamental frequency measured. The optical power exiting the cutback or replacement fiber is
denoted as Pin (f). The magnitude of the optical fiber frequency response is
</p><p class="paragraph">The fiber bandwidth is defined as the lowest frequency at which the magnitude of the fiber frequency
response has decreased to one-half its zero-frequency value. This is the -3 decibel (dB) optical power
frequency (f3dB). This frequency is referred to as the fiber bandwidth.
</p><p class="paragraph">Bandwidth is normally given in units of megahertz-kilometers (MHz-km). Converting the - 3 dB
fiber bandwidth to a unit length assists in the analysis and comparison of optical fiber performance. For
long lengths of fiber (&gt;1km), the method for normalization is to multiply the length times the measured
bandwidth.

the fiber's radius of curvature and length. The cutoff wavelength of which single mode fiber type

others. This delay difference is called the differential group delay t ( l ) per unit length. This differential
group delay leads to pulse broadening.
</p><p class="paragraph">Chromatic dispersion is measured using EIA/TIA-455-168 in the time domain. Chromatic dispersion
is also measured in the frequency domain using EIA/TIA-455-169 and EIA/TIA-455-175. These methods
measure the composite optical fiber material and waveguide dispersion. To understand the contribution
that material and waveguide dispersive mechanisms have on multimode and single mode fiber dispersion,
refer to chapter 2. In this chapter we limit the discussion on chromatic dispersion to the time domain
method described in EIA/TIA-455-168.
</p><p class="paragraph">The chromatic dispersion of multimode graded-index and single mode fiber is obtained by measuring
fiber group delays in the time domain. These measurements are made using multiwavelength sources or
multiple sources of different wavelengths. A multiwavelength source could be a wavelength-selectable
laser.
</p><p class="paragraph">The pulse delay for both a long test sample fiber and a short reference fiber are measured over a
range of wavelengths. The pulse delay for the reference fiber as a function of wavelength is t in( l ). The
pulse delay for the test fiber as a function of wavelength is t out( l ). The group delay t ( l ). per unit length at
each wavelength is

The fiber chromatic dispersion is defined as the derivative, or slope, of the fiber group delay curve
</p><p class="paragraph">with respect to wavelength. Generally, the group delay as a function of wavelength is fit to a simple
mathematical function and the derivative calculated. The range of wavelengths over which meaningful
data is obtained depends on the wavelength range of optical source(s) used. The zero-dispersion
wavelength ( l 0) and the zero-dispersion slope (S0) are determined from the chromatic dispersion curve.

</h3><p class="paragraph">End users perform fiber geometry measurements to reduce system attenuation and coupling loss
resulting from poor fiber fabrication. Fiber attenuation and intrinsic coupling loss result from mismatches
in the inherent fiber characteristics of two connecting fibers. Fiber mismatches occur when manufacturers
fail to maintain optical or structural (geometrical) tolerances during the fiber fabrication process. Fiber
geometry measurements performed in the laboratory identify fiber mismatches before the optical fiber is
installed.

parameters. Additional test methods exist for measuring multimode fiber core diameter and NA. For
single mode fibers, the mode field diameter measurement replaces core diameter and NA measurements.
Core diameter, numerical aperture, and mode field diameter measurements are identified and explained
later in this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">To make fiber geometry measurements, the input end of the fiber is overfilled and any cladding
power stripped out. The output end of the fiber is prepared and viewed with a video camera. Generally the
fiber is less than 10 m in length. An objective lens magnifies the output image (typically 20 · ) going to a
video camera. The image from the video camera is displayed on a video monitor and is also sent to the
computer for digital analysis.
</p><p class="paragraph">The computer analyzes the image to identify the edges of the core and cladding. The centers rc and rg
of the core and cladding, respectively, are found. The cladding diameter is defined as the average
diameter of the cladding. The cladding diameter is twice the average radius (Rg). The core diameter is
defined as the average diameter of the core. The core diameter is twice the average core radius (Rc).
</p><p class="paragraph">Cladding noncircularity, or ellipticity, is the difference between the smallest radius of the fiber
(Rgmin) and the largest radius (Rgmax) divided by the average cladding radius (Rg). The value of the
cladding noncircularity is expressed as a percentage.
</p><p class="paragraph">The core-cladding concentricity error for multimode fibers is the distance between the core and

</h3><p class="paragraph">Insertion loss is composed of the connection coupling loss and additional fiber losses in the fiber
following the connection. In multimode fiber, fiber joints can increase fiber attenuation following the
joint by disturbing the fiber's mode power distribution (MPD). Fiber joints may increase fiber attenuation
because disturbing the MPD may excite radiative modes. Radiative modes are unbound modes that
radiate out of the fiber contributing to joint loss. In single mode fibers, fiber joints can cause the
second-order mode to propagate in the fiber following the joint. As long as the coupling loss of the
connection is small, neither radiative modes (multimode fiber) or the second-order mode (single mode
fiber) are excited.

the connection and after the connection may be specified for some applications. Power measurements are

Return Loss and Reflectance
</p><p class="paragraph">Reflections occur at optical fiber connections. Optical power may be reflected back into the source
fiber when connecting two optical fibers. In laser-based systems, reflected power reaching the optical
source can reduce system performance by affecting the stability (operation) of the source. In addition,
multiple reflections occur in fiber optic data links containing more than one connection. Multiple
reflections can reduce data link performance by increasing the signal noise present at the optical detector.
</p><p class="paragraph">Reflectance is a measure of the portion of incident light that is reflected back into the source fiber at
the point of connection. Reflectance is given as a ratio (R) of the reflected light intensity to the incident
light intensity. The reflectance ratio (R) for Fresnel reflection is discussed in chapter 4.
</p><p class="paragraph">Return loss and reflectance are measured using EIA/TIA-455-107. They are measured using an
optical source connected to one input of a 2 · 2 fiber optic coupler. Light is launched into the component
under test through the fiber optic coupler. The light reflected from the component under test is transmitted
back through the fiber optic coupler to a detector connected to the other input port. The optical power is
measured at the output of the device under test (Po) and at the input port of the coupler where the detector
is located (Pr). Po is corrected to account for the loss in power through the device under test. Pr is
corrected to account for the loss in power through the coupler and any other connection losses in the path.
The reflectance is then given by the ratio Pr/Po.

</p><p class="paragraph">laboratory can change after the installation of these components on board ship. End users must perform
field measurements to evaluate those properties most likely affected by the installation or repair of fiber
optic components or systems.
</p><p class="paragraph">The discussion on field measurements is limited to optical fiber and optical connection properties.
Optical fiber and optical connection field measurements evaluate only the transmission properties affected
by component or system installation or repair. Because optical fiber geometrical properties, such as core
and cladding diameter and numerical aperture, are not expected to change, there is no need to remeasure
these properties. The optical fiber properties that are likely to change include fiber attenuation (loss) and
bandwidth. Bandwidth changes in the field tend to be beneficial, so field bandwidth measurement is
generally not performed. If field bandwidth measurements are required, they are essentially the same as
laboratory measurements so they will not be repeated. The optical connection properties that are likely to
change are connection insertion loss and reflectance and return loss.
</p><p class="paragraph">The installation and repair of fiber optic components on board ship can affect system operation.
Microbends introduced during installation can increase fiber attenuation. Modal redistribution at fiber
joints can increase fiber attenuation in the fiber after the joint. Fiber breaks or faults can prevent or
severely disrupt system operation. Poor fiber connections can also increase insertion loss and degrade
transmitter and receiver performance by increasing reflectance and return loss. End users should perform
field measurements to verify that component performance is within allowable limits so system
performance is not adversely affected.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are additional differences in measuring optical fiber and optical connection properties in the
field than in the laboratory. Field measurements require rugged, portable test equipment, unlike the
sophisticated test equipment used in the laboratory. Field test equipment must provide accurate
measurements in extreme environmental conditions. Since electrical power sources may not always be
available in the field, test equipment should allow battery operation. In addition, while both fiber ends are
available for conducting laboratory measurements, only one fiber end may be readily available for field
measurements. Even if both fiber ends are available for field measurements, the fiber ends are normally
located some distance apart. Therefore, field measurements may require two people.
</p><p class="paragraph">The main field measurement technique involves optical time-domain reflectometry. An optical time-
domain reflectometer (OTDR) is recommended for conducting field measurements on installed optical
fibers or links of 50 meters or more in length. An OTDR requires access to only one fiber end. An OTDR
measures the attenuation of installed optical fibers as a function of length. It also identifies and evaluates
optical connection losses along a cable link and locates any fiber breaks or faults.
</p><p class="paragraph">End users can also measure fiber attenuation and cable plant transmission loss using an optical power
meter and a stabilized light source. End users use this measurement technique when optical time-domain
reflectometry is not recommended. Measurements obtained with a stabilized light source and power meter
are more accurate than those obtained with an OTDR. Measuring fiber attenuation and transmission loss
using a power meter and light source requires access to both ends of the fiber or link. An optical loss test
set (OLTS) combines the power meter and source functions into one physical unit.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Optical Time-Domain Reflectometry
</h3><p class="paragraph">End users use optical time-domain reflectometry to characterize optical fiber and optical connection
properties in the field. In optical time-domain reflectometry, an OTDR transmits an optical pulse through
an installed optical fiber. The OTDR measures the fraction of light that is reflected back due to Rayleigh
scattering and Fresnel reflection. By comparing the amount of light scattered back at different times, the
OTDR can determine fiber and connection losses. When several fibers are connected to form an installed
cable plant, the OTDR can characterize optical fiber and optical connection properties along the entire
length of the cable plant. A fiber optic cable plant consists of optical fiber cables, connectors, splices,
mounting panels, jumper cables, and other passive components. A cable plant does not include active
components such as optical transmitters or receivers.
</p><p class="paragraph">The OTDR displays the backscattered and reflected optical signal as a function of length. The OTDR
plots half the power in decibels (dB) versus half the distance. Plotting half the power in dB and half the
distance corrects for round trip effects. By analyzing the OTDR plot, or trace, end users can measure fiber
attenuation and transmission loss between any two points along the cable plant. End users can also
measure insertion loss and reflectance of any optical connection. In addition, end users use the OTDR
trace to locate fiber breaks or faults.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 5-13 shows an example OTDR trace of an installed cable plant. OTDR traces can have
several common characteristics. An OTDR trace begins with an initial input pulse. This pulse is a result
of Fresnel reflection occurring at the connection to the OTDR. Following this pulse, the OTDR trace is a
gradual downsloping curve interrupted by abrupt shifts. Periods of gradual decline in the OTDR trace
result from Rayleigh scattering as light travels along each fiber section of the cable plant. Periods of
gradual decline are interrupted by abrupt shifts called point defects. A point defect is a temporary or
permanent local deviation of the OTDR signal in the upward or downward direction. Point defects are
caused by connectors, splices, or breaks along the fiber length. Point defects, or faults, can be reflective or
nonreflective. An output pulse at the end of the OTDR trace indicates the end of the fiber cable plant.
This output pulse results from Fresnel reflection occurring at the output fiber-end face.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">ATTENUATION.—The fiber optic test method for measuring the attenuation of an installed optical
fiber using an OTDR is EIA/TIA-455-61. The accuracy of this test method depends on the user entering
the appropriate source wavelength, pulse duration, and fiber length (test range) into the OTDR. In
addition, the effective group index of the test fiber is required before the attenuation coefficient and
accurate distances can be recorded. The group index (N) is provided by fiber manufacturers or is found
using EIA/TIA-455-60. By entering correct test parameters, OTDR fiber attenuation values will closely
coincide with those measured by the cutback technique.
</p><p class="paragraph">Test personnel can connect the test fiber directly to the OTDR or to a dead-zone fiber. This dead-
zone fiber is placed between the test fiber and OTDR to reduce the effect of the initial reflection at the
OTDR on the fiber measurement. The dead-zone fiber is inserted because minimizing the reflection at a
fiber joint is easier than reducing the reflection at the OTDR connection.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 5-14 illustrates the OTDR measurement points for measuring the attenuation of the test fiber
using a dead-zone fiber. Fiber attenuation between two points along the test fiber is measured on gradual
downsloping sections on the OTDR trace. There should be no point defects present along the portion of
fiber being tested.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">OTDRs are equipped with either manual or automatic cursors to locate points of interest along the
trace. In figure 5-14, a cursor is positioned at a distance zo on the rising edge of the reflection at the end of
the dead-zone fiber. Cursors are also positioned at distances z1 and z2. The cursor positioned at z1 is just
beyond the recovery from the reflection at the end of the dead-zone fiber. Since no point defects are
present in figure 5-14, the cursor positioned at z2 locates the end of the test fiber. Cursor z2 is positioned
just before the output pulse resulting from Fresnel reflection occurring at the end of the test fiber.

At any point along the length of fiber, attenuation values can change depending on the amount of
</p><p class="paragraph">optical power backscattered due to Rayleigh scattering. The amount of backscattered optical power at
each point depends on the forward optical power and its backscatter capture coefficient. The backscatter
capture coefficient varies with length depending on fiber properties. Fiber properties that may affect the
backscatter coefficient include the refractive index profile, numerical aperture (multimode), and
mode-field diameter (single mode) at the particular measurement point. The source wavelength and pulse
width may also affect the amount of backscattered power.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">By performing the OTDR attenuation measurement in each direction along the test fiber, test
personnel can eliminate the effects of backscatter variations. Attenuation measurements made in the
opposite direction at the same wavelength (within 5 nm) are averaged to reduce the effect of backscatter
variations. This process is called bidirectional averaging. Bidirectional averaging is possible only if test
personnel have access to both fiber ends. OTDR attenuation values obtained using bidirectional averaging
should compare with those measured using the cutback technique in the laboratory.
</p><p class="paragraph">POINT DEFECTS.—Point defects are temporary or local deviations of the OTDR signal in the
upward or downward direction. A point defect, or fault, can be reflective or nonreflective. A point defect
normally exhibits a loss of optical power. However, a point defect may exhibit an apparent power gain. In
some cases, a point defect can even exhibit no loss or gain. Refer back to figure 5-13; it illustrates a
reflective fault and a nonreflective fault, both exhibiting loss. Figure 5-15 shows a nonreflective fault with
apparent gain and a reflective fault with no apparent loss or gain.
</p><p class="paragraph">Point defects are located and measured using EIA/TIA-455-59. Test personnel must enter the
appropriate input parameters including the source wavelength, the pulse duration, and the fiber or cable
group index into the OTDR. The nature of fiber point defects depends on the value of each parameter
entered by the end user. The pulse duration usually limits the length of the point defect while other input
parameters, such as the wavelength, can vary its shape.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the length of the fiber point defect changes with the pulse duration, then the OTDR signal
deviation is in fact a point defect. If the length remains the same, then the OTDR signal deviation is a
region of high fiber attenuation. Regions of high fiber attenuation are referred to as attenuation
non-uniformities.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber point defects occur from factory fiber splices or bends introduced during cable construction or
installation. For shipboard applications, manufacturers are not allowed to splice fibers during cable
construction. Fiber joints are natural sources of OTDR point defects. However, fiber breaks, cracks, or
microbends introduced during cable installation are additional sources of point defects.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">5-24
</p><p class="paragraph">Point defects that occur at fiber joints are relatively easy to identify because the location of a fiber
joint is generally known. A reflective or nonreflective fault occurs at a distance equal to fiber joint
location. In most circumstances, an optical connector produces a reflective fault, while an optical splice
produces a nonreflective fault.
</p><p class="paragraph">Reflective and nonreflective faults occurring at distances other than fiber joint locations identify
fiber breaks, cracks, or microbends. A fiber break produces a reflective fault because fiber breaks result in
complete fiber separation. Fiber cracks and microbends generally produce nonreflective faults.
</p><p class="paragraph">A point defect may exhibit apparent gain because the backscatter coefficient of the fiber present
before the point defect is higher than that of the fiber present after. Test personnel measure the signal loss
or gain by positioning a pair of cursors, one on each side of the point defect. Figure 5-16 illustrates the
positioning of the cursors for a point defect showing an apparent signal gain. The trace after the point
defect is extrapolated as shown in figure 5-16. The vertical distance between the two lines in figure 5-16
is the apparent gain of the point defect.
</p><p class="paragraph">Point defects exhibiting gain in one direction will exhibit an exaggerated loss in the opposite
direction. Figure 5-17 shows the apparent loss shown by the OTDR for the same point defect shown in
figure 5-16 when measured in the opposite direction. Bidirectional measurements are conducted to cancel
the effects of backscatter coefficient variations. Bidirectional averaging combines the two values to
identify the true signal loss. Bidirectional averaging is possible only if test personnel have access to both
ends of the test sample.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

places as for measuring the loss of the point defect. The return loss of the point defect is displayed when
the return loss option is selected on the OTDR. The steps for selecting the return loss option depend upon
the OTDR being used.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Power Meter
</h3><p class="paragraph">Test personnel also use an optical power meter and stabilized light source to measure fiber
attenuation and transmission loss in the field. Optical power meter measurements are recommended when
the length of an installed optical fiber cable or cable plant is less than 50 meters. A test jumper is used to
couple light from the stabilized source to one end of the optical fiber (or cable plant) under test. An
additional test jumper is also used to connect the other end of the optical fiber (or cable plant) under test
to the power meter. Optical power meter measurements may be conducted using an optical loss test set
(OLTS). An OLTS combines the power meter and source functions into one physical unit. When making
measurements, it does not matter whether the stabilized source and power meter are in one physical unit
or two.
</p><p class="paragraph">Power meter measurements are conducted on individual optical fiber cables installed on board ship.
The installed optical fiber cable must have connectors or terminations on both ends to make the
measurement. If the installed optical fiber cable does not have connectors or terminations on both ends, an
OTDR should be used to evaluate the cable. If the cable is too short for evaluation with an OTDR, cable
continuity can be verified using a flashlight.
</p><p class="paragraph">Power meter measurements for cable assembly link loss require that test personnel clean all optical
connections at test jumper interfaces before performing any measurement. Test personnel should use
cotton wipes dampened with alcohol to clean connectors and blow dry before making connections. End
users should also ensure that test equipment calibration is current.
</p><p class="paragraph">Power meter measurements connecting a test reference cable between the light source and power
meter. The test reference cable has the same nominal fiber characteristics as the cable under test. The
optical power present at the power meter is the reference power (P1). Disconnect the test reference cable
and connect the optical fiber cable under test between the light source and power meter using test
jumpers. If possible, the test reference cable should be used as the input jumper cable for the test cable
measurement. The test jumper fiber properties, such as core diameter and NA, should be nominally equal
to the fiber properties of the cable being tested. The optical power present at the power meter is test power
(P2).
</p><p class="paragraph">Test personnel use P1 and P2 to calculate the cable assembly link loss. The cable assembly link loss
(BCA) of optical fiber installed with connectors or terminations on both ends is
</p><p class="paragraph">The cable assembly link loss should always be less than the specified link loss for that particular
link.
</p><p class="paragraph">Besides measuring individual cables, test personnel measure the transmission loss of installed fiber
optic cable plants. The transmission loss of fiber optic cable plants is measured using EIA/TIA-526-14
method B (multimode fiber) or EIA/TIA-526-7 (single mode fiber). The procedure measures the internal
loss of the cable plant between points A and B, plus two connection losses. Figure 5-18 (A) illustrates the
method described in EIA/TIA-526-14 method B for measuring the reference power (P1). Figure 5-18 (B)
shows the final test configuration for measuring the cable plant test power (P2).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

measurements in both directions and at each system operational wavelength. By performing these

decreased to one half its zero-frequency value is the -3 decibel (dB) optical power frequency (f3dB).

</h2><p class="paragraph">Chapter 1 taught you that a fiber optic data link has three basic functions. One function is that a fiber
optic data link must convert an electrical signal to an optical signal permitting the transfer of data along
an optical fiber. The fiber optic device responsible for that signal conversion is a fiber optic transmitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">A fiber optic transmitter is a hybrid device. It converts electrical signals into optical signals and
launches the optical signals into an optical fiber. A fiber optic transmitter consists of an interface circuit, a
source drive circuit, and an optical source. The interface circuit accepts the incoming electrical signal and
processes it to make it compatible with the source drive circuit. The source drive circuit intensity
modulates the optical source by varying the current through the source.
</p><p class="paragraph">An optical source converts electrical energy (current) into optical energy (light). Light emitted by an
optical source is launched, or coupled, into an optical fiber for transmission. Fiber optic data link
performance depends on the amount of optical power (light) launched into the optical fiber. This chapter
attempts to provide an understanding of light-generating mechanisms within the main types of optical
sources used in fiber optics.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic communication systems operate in the 850-nm, the 1300-nm, and the 1550-nm
wavelength windows. Semiconductor sources are designed to operate at wavelengths that minimize
optical fiber absorption and maximize system bandwidth. By designing an optical source to operate at
specific wavelengths, absorption from impurities in the optical fiber, such as hydroxyl ions (OH -), can be
minimized. Maximizing system bandwidth involves designing optical fibers and sources that minimize
chromatic and intermodal dispersion at the intended operational wavelength.
</p><p class="paragraph">Initially, the material properties of semiconductor optical sources provided for optical emission in
the 850-nm wavelength region. An 850-nm operational wavelength avoids fiber absorption loss from OH-
impurities near the 900-nm wavelength. Light sources for 850-nm systems were originally semiconductor
LEDs and lasers. Currently, most 850-nm systems use LEDs as a light source. LEDs operating at 850-nm
provide sufficient optical power for short-distance, low-bandwidth systems. However, multimode fiber
dispersion, the relatively high fiber attenuation, and the LED's relatively low optical output power prevent
the use of these devices in longer-distance, higher bandwidth systems.
</p><p class="paragraph">The first development allowing the operational wavelength to move from 850 nm to 1300 nm was
the introduction of multimode graded-index fibers. Multimode graded-index fibers have substantially
lower intermodal dispersion than multimode step-index fibers. Systems operating at 850 nm cannot take
full advantage of the fiber's low intermodal dispersion because of high chromatic dispersion at 850 nm.
However, the use of multimode graded-index fibers allow 850-nm LEDs to operate satisfactorily in
short-distance, higher bandwidth systems.
</p><p class="paragraph">Following the enhancements in multimode fiber design, next generation LEDs were designed to
provide optical emission in the 1300-nm region. Multimode graded-index fiber systems using these LEDs
can operate over longer distances and at higher bandwidths than 850-nm systems. Longer distances and
higher bandwidths are possible because fiber material losses and dispersion are significantly reduced at
the 1300-nm region.
</p><p class="paragraph">Advances in single mode fiber design and construction sped the development of semiconductor
LEDs and LDs optimized for single mode fibers. Single mode fibers have very low dispersion values.
However, existing LEDs were unable to focus and launch sufficient optical power into single mode fibers</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor LEDs emit incoherent light. Spontaneous emission of light in semiconductor LEDs
produces light waves that lack a fixed-phase relationship. Light waves that lack a fixed-phase relationship
are referred to as incoherent light. Spontaneous emission of light is discussed in more detail later in this
chapter. The use of LEDs in single mode systems is severely limited because they emit unfocused
incoherent light. Even LEDs developed for single mode systems are unable to launch sufficient optical
power into single mode fibers for many applications. LEDs are the preferred optical source for multimode
systems because they can launch sufficient power at a lower cost than semiconductor LDs.
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor LDs emit coherent light. LDs produce light waves with a fixed-phase relationship
(both spatial and temporal) between points on the electromagnetic wave. Light waves having a fixed-
phase relationship are referred to as coherent light. Stimulated emission of light is discussed later in this
chapter. Since semiconductor LDs emit more focused light than LEDs, they are able to launch optical
power into both single mode and multimode optical fibers. However, LDs are usually used only in single
mode fiber systems because they require more complex driver circuitry and cost more than LEDs.
</p><p class="paragraph">Optical power produced by optical sources can range from microwatts (ÿW) for LEDs to tens of
milliwatts (mW) for semiconductor LDs. However, it is not possible to effectively couple all the available
optical power into the optical fiber for transmission.
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of optical power coupled into the fiber is the relevant optical power. It depends on the
following factors:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• The angles over which the light is emitted
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• The size of the source's light-emitting area relative to the fiber core size
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• The alignment of the source and fiber

</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor LEDs emit light spread out at even larger angles. Coupling losses of several decibels can
easily occur when coupling light from an optical source to a fiber, especially with LEDs.
</p><p class="paragraph">Source-to-fiber coupling efficiency is a measure of the relevant optical power. The coupling

</h2><p class="paragraph">Understanding optical emission in semiconductor lasers and LEDs requires knowledge of
semiconductor material and device properties. Providing a complete description of semiconductor
properties is beyond the scope of this introductory manual. In this chapter we only discuss the general
properties of semiconductor LEDs and LDs.
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor sources are diodes, with all of the characteristics typical of diodes. However, their
construction includes a special layer, called the active layer, which emits photons (light particles) when a
current passes through the layer. The particular properties of the semiconductor are determined by the
materials used and the layering of the materials within the semiconductor. Silicon (Si) and gallium
arsenide (GaAs) are the two most common semiconductor materials used in electronic and electro-optic
devices. In some cases other elements, such as aluminum (Al), indium (In) and phosphorus (P), are added
to the base semiconductor material to modify the semiconductor properties. These elements are called
dopants.
</p><p class="paragraph">Current flowing through a semiconductor optical source causes it to produce light. An in-depth
description of either of the two processes by which this occurs is beyond the scope of this module.
However, we discuss elementary descriptions in the following paragraphs.
</p><p class="paragraph">LEDs generally produce light through spontaneous emission when a current is passed through them.
Spontaneous emission is the random generation of photons within the active layer of the LED. The
emitted photons move in random directions. Only a certain percentage of the photons exit the
semiconductor and are coupled into the fiber. Many of the photons are absorbed by the LED materials and
the energy dissipated as heat. This process causes the light output from an LED to be incoherent, have a
broad spectral width, and have a wide output pattern.
</p><p class="paragraph">Laser diodes are much more complex than LEDs. Laser is an acronym for light amplification by the
stimulated emission of radiation. Laser diodes produce light through stimulated emission when a current
is passed through them. Stimulated emission describes how light is produced in any type of laser. In the
laser diode, photons, initially produced by spontaneous emission interact with the laser material to
produce additional photons. This process occurs within the active area of the diode called the laser cavity.
The process does not affect the original photon. The stimulated photon has many of the same properties
(wavelength, direction, phase) as the original photon.
</p><p class="paragraph">As with the LED, not all of the photons produced are emitted from the laser diode. Some of the
photons are absorbed and the energy dissipated as heat. The emission process and the physical
characteristics of the diode cause the light output to be coherent, have a narrow spectral width, and have a
narrow output pattern.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

spontaneous emission, when a current is passed through it. Typically LEDs for the 850-nm region are
fabricated using GaAs and AlGaAs. LEDs for the 1300-nm and 1550-nm regions are fabricated using
InGaAsP and InP.
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic LED types used for fiber optic communication systems are the surface-emitting LED
(SLED), the edge-emitting LED (ELED), and the superluminescent diode (SLD). LED performance
differences help link designers decide which device is appropriate for the intended application. For
short-distance (0 to 3 km), low-data-rate fiber optic systems, SLEDs and ELEDs are the preferred optical
source. Typically, SLEDs operate efficiently for bit rates up to 250 megabits per second (Mb/s). Because
SLEDs emit light over a wide area (wide far-field angle), they are almost exclusively used in multimode
systems.
</p><p class="paragraph">For medium-distance, medium-data-rate systems, ELEDs are preferred. ELEDs may be modulated at
rates up to 400 Mb/s. ELEDs may be used for both single mode and multimode fiber systems. Both SLDs
and ELEDs are used in long-distance, high-data-rate systems. SLDs are ELED-based diodes designed to
operate in the superluminescence mode. A further discussion on superluminescence is provided later in
this chapter. SLDs may be modulated at bit rates of over 400 Mb/s.

Burrus, its developer. In SLEDs, the size of the primary active region is limited to a small circular area of
20 m m to 50 m m in diameter. The active region is the portion of the LED where photons are emitted. The
primary active region is below the surface of the semiconductor substrate perpendicular to the axis of the
fiber. A well is etched into the substrate to allow direct coupling of the emitted light to the optical fiber.
The etched well allows the optical fiber to come into close contact with the emitting surface. In addition,
the epoxy resin that binds the optical fiber to the SLED reduces the refractive index mismatch, increasing
coupling efficiency.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

front facet with antireflection material, the front facet reduces optical feedback and allows light emission.
ELEDs emit light only through the front facet.

couple more power into small NA fibers than SLEDs. ELEDs can couple enough power into single mode

the selected modes must exceed the optical loss during one round-trip through the cavity. This process is
referred to as optical feedback.

from stimulated emission rather than spontaneous emission. Figure 6-4 illustrates the transition from

spontaneous emission is the threshold current. Before the threshold current is reached, the optical output
power increases only slightly with small increases in drive current. However, after the threshold current is

provides no diagram detailing LD structures because they are similar to ELEDs in design. The rear facet
is typically coated with a reflective layer so that all of the light striking the facet is reflected back into the
active region. The front facet is typically left uncoated so that most of the light is emitted. By increasing
the drive current, the diode becomes a laser.
</p><p class="paragraph">At currents below the threshold current, LDs function as ELEDs. To optimize frequency response,
laser diodes are often biased above this laser threshold. As a result, in an LD fiber optic system, light is
modulated between a high power level and a lower power level, but never shut off. LDs typically can be
modulated at frequencies up to over 2 gigahertz (GHz). Some lasers are capable of being modulated at
frequencies over 20 GHz.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are several important differences between LDs and LEDs. One is that LEDs usually lack
reflective facets and in some cases are designed to suppress reflections back into the active region.
Another is that lasers tend to operate at higher drive currents to produce light. A higher driver current
results in more complicated drive circuits and more heat dissipation in the device.
</p><p class="paragraph">LDs are also much more temperature sensitive than either SLEDs or ELEDs. Increases in the laser
temperature significantly reduce laser output power. Increases in laser temperature beyond certain limits
result in the loss of lasing. When lasers are used in many applications, the temperature of the laser must
be controlled. Typically, electronic coolers, called thermo-electric (TE) coolers, are used to cool LDs in
system applications.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SUPERLUMINESCENT-DIODES-6-9-">SUPERLUMINESCENT DIODES
</h2><p class="paragraph">Superluminescence occurs when the spontaneous emissions of an ELED experience gain due to
higher injected currents and reflections from facets. Superluminescent diodes (SLDs) are differentiated
from both conventional LEDs and LDs. Although the output is not fully coherent, SLDs emit light that
consists of amplified spontaneous emissions. The spectral width and beam angle of SLDs are narrower
than that of conventional LEDs and wider than that of LDs.
</p><p class="paragraph">An SLD is, in essence, a combination of a laser and an ELED. SLDs are similar in geometry to lasers
but have no built-in optical feedback mechanism required by laser diodes for stimulated emission to
achieve lasing. SLDs have structural features similar to those of ELEDs that suppress the lasing action by
reducing the reflectivity of the facets. SLDs are essentially highly optimized ELEDs.
</p><p class="paragraph">While SLDs operate like ELEDs at low current levels, their output power increases superlinearly and
the spectral width narrows at high currents. Optical gain resulting from the higher injection currents
causes the superlinear power increase and narrowing of the spectral width.
</p><p class="paragraph">The advantages of SLDs over conventional LEDs include higher coupled power, narrower spectral
width, and greater bandwidths. The disadvantages include nonlinear power-current characteristics, higher
temperature sensitivity, and lower reliability.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FIBER-OPTIC-TRANSMITTERS-6-10-">FIBER OPTIC TRANSMITTERS
</h2><p class="paragraph">As stated previously, a fiber optic transmitter is a hybrid electro-optic device. It converts electrical
signals into optical signals and launches the optical signals into an optical fiber. A fiber optic transmitter
consists of an interface circuit, a source drive circuit, and an optical source. The interface circuit accepts
the incoming electrical signal and processes it to make it compatible with the source drive circuit. The
source drive circuit intensity modulates the optical source by varying the current through it. The optical
signal is coupled into an optical fiber through the transmitter output interface.
</p><p class="paragraph">Although semiconductor LEDs and LDs have many similarities, unique transmitter designs result
from differences between LED and LD sources. Transmitter designs compensate for differences in optical
output power, response time, linearity, and thermal behavior between LEDs and LDs to ensure proper
system operation. Nonlinearities caused by junction heating in LEDs and mode instabilities in LDs
necessitate the use of linearizing circuits within the transmitter in some cases.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic transmitters using LDs require more complex circuitry than transmitters using LEDs. The
basic requirement for digital systems is for drive circuitry to switch the optical output on and off at high
speeds in response to logic voltage levels at the input of the source drive circuit. Because LDs are
threshold devices, LDs are supplied with a bias just below the threshold in the off state. This bias is often
referred to as prebias. One reason for prebiasing the LD is to reduce the turn-on delay in digital systems.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most LD transmitters contain output power control circuitry to compensate for temperature
sensitivity. This circuitry maintains the LD output at a constant average value by adjusting the bias
current of the laser. In most cases LED transmitters do not contain output power control circuitry. LD and
LED transmitters may also contain cooling devices to maintain the source at a relatively constant
temperature. Most LD transmitters either have an internal thermo electric cooler or require a relatively
controlled external temperature. Because LDs require more complex circuitry than LEDs, fiber optic
transmitters using LDs are more expensive. For more information concerning fiber optic transmitters and
their drive circuitry, refer to the reference material listed in appendix 2.
</p><p class="paragraph">Transmitter output interfaces generally fall into two categories: optical connectors and optical fiber
pigtails. Optical pigtails are attached to the transmitter optical source. This pigtail is generally routed out
of the transmitter package as a coated fiber in a loose buffer tube or a single fiber cable. The pigtail is
either soldered or epoxied to the transmitter package to provide fiber strain relief. The buffer tube or
single fiber cable is also attached to the transmitter package to provide additional strain relief.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic transmitters come in various sizes and shapes. The least complex fiber optic transmitters
are typically packaged in transistor outline (TO) cans or hybrid microcircuit modules in dual inline
packages (DIPs). These simple transmitters may require separate circuitry in the system equipment to
provide an acceptable input signal to the transmitter. More complex fiber optic transmitters are available
that have some or all of the signal conditioning circuitry integrated into the package. These transmitters
typically are packaged in hybrid microcircuit modules in either DIP or butterfly lead packages, circuit
cards, or complete stand-alone fiber optic converters. Stand-alone fiber optic converters and circuit cards
generally contain sources in either TO cans or one of the hybrid microcircuit packages. For commercial
applications, the most popular transmitter packages are the TO can and the DIP hybrid microcircuit.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic transmitters can be classified into two categories: digital and analog. Digital transmitters
produce two discrete optical power levels. These levels are essentially on and off with the exception that
some light is emitted in the off state by some transmitters. Analog transmitters continuously vary the

multi-channel analog audio and video systems as well as frequency modulated (FM) systems. Laser
sources are almost never used in low- or moderate-frequency analog applications. The main reason for

referred to as coherent light.
</p><p class="paragraph">SEMICONDUCTOR LED'S emit incoherent light. Light waves that lack a fixed-phase relationship
are referred to as incoherent light.
</p><p class="paragraph">The RELEVANT OPTICAL POWER is the amount of optical power coupled into the fiber. It
depends on the angle over which the light is emitted, the size of the source's light-emitting area relative to
the fiber core size, the alignment of the source and fiber, and the coupling characteristics of the fiber
(such as the NA and the refractive index profile).
</p><p class="paragraph">SOURCE-TO-FIBER COUPLING EFFICIENCY is a measure of the relevant optical power.
</p><p class="paragraph">SILICON (Si) and GALLIUM ARSENIDE (GaAs) are the two most common semiconductor
materials used in electronic and electro-optic devices.
</p><p class="paragraph">In a semiconductor device, PHOTONS (LIGHT) are emitted when current flows through the active
area.
</p><p class="paragraph">SPONTANEOUS EMISSION occurs when photons are emitted in a random manner. Spontaneous
emission produces incoherent light.
</p><p class="paragraph">STIMULATED EMISSION occurs when a photon interacts with the laser material to produce
additional photons.
</p><p class="paragraph">A LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits incoherent light,
through spontaneous emission, when a current is passed through it. The basic LED types used for fiber
optic communication systems are the SURFACE-EMITTING LED (SLED), the EDGE-EMITTING
LED (ELED), and the SUPERLUMINESCENT DIODE (SLD).
</p><p class="paragraph">In SURFACE-EMITTING LED'S (SLEDs), the size of the primary active region is limited to a
small circular area of 20 m to 50 m in diameter. The active region is the portion of the LED where
photons are emitted. SLEDs usually emit more total power into the air gap at the fiber interface than an
ELED, but they do not launch as much power into the fiber. SLEDS also tend to emit power over a wider
spectral range than ELED.
</p><p class="paragraph">EDGE-EMITTING LED'S (ELEDs) emit light in a narrow emission angle allowing for better
source-to-fiber coupling. They couple more power into small NA fibers than SLEDs. The polished or cut
surfaces at each end of the ELED active stripe are called FACETS.
</p><p class="paragraph">SUPERLUMINESCENCE occurs when the spontaneous emissions of an ELED experience gain
due to higher injected currents and reflections from facets.
</p><p class="paragraph">SUPERLUMINESCENT DIODES (SLDs) are similar in geometry to lasers but have no built-in
optical feedback mechanism required by laser diodes for stimulated emission to achieve lasing. Although
the output is not fully coherent, superluminescent diodes (SLDs) emit light that consists of amplified
spontaneous emissions. The spectral width and beam angle of SLDs are narrower than that of
conventional LEDs and wider than that of LDs.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ADVANTAGES of SLDs over conventional LEDs include higher coupled power, narrower
spectral width, and greater bandwidths. The DISADVANTAGES include nonlinear power-current
characteristics, higher temperature sensitivity, and lower reliability.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

electrical signals, converting them into optical signals, and launching the optical signals into an optical
fiber. The optical signals propagating in the fiber become weakened and distorted because of scattering,
absorption, and dispersion. The fiber optic device responsible for converting the weakened and distorted
optical signal back to an electrical signal is a fiber optic receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">A fiber optic receiver is an electro-optic device that accepts optical signals from an optical fiber and
converts them into electrical signals. A typical fiber optic receiver consists of an optical detector, a
low-noise amplifier, and other circuitry used to produce the output electrical signal (see figure 7-1). The
optical detector converts the incoming optical signal into an electrical signal. The amplifier then amplifies
the electrical signal to a level suitable for further signal processing. The type of other circuitry contained
within the receiver depends on what type of modulation is used and the receiver electrical output
requirements.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic communications systems require that optical detectors meet specific performance and
compatibility requirements. Many of the requirements are similar to those of an optical source. Fiber optic
systems require that optical detectors:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Be compatible in size to low-loss optical fibers to allow for efficient coupling and easy
packaging.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Have a high sensitivity at the operating wavelength of the optical source.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Have a sufficiently short response time (sufficiently wide bandwidth) to handle the system's data
rate.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Contribute low amounts of noise to the system.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Maintain stable operation in changing environmental conditions, such as temperature.
</p><p class="paragraph">Optical detectors that meet many of these requirements and are suitable for fiber optic systems are
semiconductor photodiodes. The principal optical detectors used in fiber optic systems include
semiconductor positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) photodiodes and avalanche photodiodes (APDs).

coupled to optical fibers. Fiber-to-photodiode coupling involves centering the flat fiber-end face over the
photodiode active area. This is normally done directly by butt coupling the fiber up to the photodiode
surface. As long as the photodiode active area is larger than that of the fiber core, fiber-to-detector
coupling losses are very low. In some cases a lens may be used to couple the fiber end-face to the
detector. However, this is not typically done.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The mechanism by which optical detectors convert optical power into electrical current requires
knowledge of semiconductor material and device properties. As stated in chapter 6, providing a complete
description of these properties is beyond the scope of this manual. In this chapter we only discuss the
general properties of semiconductor PINs and APDs.
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor detectors are designed so that optical energy (photons) incident on the detector active
area produces a current. This current is called a photocurrent. The particular properties of the
semiconductor are determined by the materials used and the layering of the materials within the device.
Silicon (Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs), germanium (Ge), and indium phosphide (InP) are the most
common semiconductor materials used in optical detectors. In some cases aluminum (Al) and indium (In)
are used as dopants in the base semiconductor material.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Responsivity
</h3><p class="paragraph">Responsivity is the ratio of the optical detector's output photocurrent in amperes to the incident
optical power in watts. The responsivity of a detector is a function of the wavelength of the incident light
and the efficiency of the device in responding to that wavelength. For a particular material, only photons
of certain wavelengths will generate a photocurrent when they are absorbed. Additionally, the detector
material absorbs some wavelengths better than others. These two properties cause the wavelength
dependence in the detector responsivity. Responsivity is a useful parameter for characterizing detector
performance because it relates the photocurrent generated to the incident optical power.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A PIN photodiode is a semiconductor positive-negative (p-n) structure with an intrinsic region
sandwiched between the other two regions (see figure 7-2). It is normally operated by applying a
reverse-bias voltage. The magnitude of the reverse-bias voltage depends on the photodiode application,
but typically is less than a few volts. When no light is incident on the photodiode, a current is still
produced. This current is called the dark current. The dark current is the leakage current that flows when
a reverse bias is applied and no light is incident on the photodiode. Dark current is dependent on
temperature. While dark current may initially be low, it will increase as the device temperature increases.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">There are several factors that influence the response time of a photodiode and its output circuitry (see
figure 7-3). The most important of these are the thickness of the detector active area and the detector RC
time constant. The detector thickness is related to the amount of time required for the electrons generated
to flow out of the detector active area. This time is referred to as the electron transit time. The thicker the
detector active area, the longer the transit time will be.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

constant. The capacitance of the photodetector must be kept small to prevent the RC time constant from
limiting the response time. The photodiode capacitance consists mainly of the junction capacitance and
any capacitance relating to packaging. The RC time constant is given by tRC = RC.
</p><p class="paragraph">Trade-offs between fast transit times and low capacitance are necessary for high-speed response.
However, any change in photodiode parameters to optimize the transit time and capacitance can also
affect responsivity, dark current, and coupling efficiency. A fast transit time requires a thin detector active
area, while low capacitance and high responsivity require a thick active region. The diameter of the
detector active area can also be minimized. This reduces the detector dark current and minimizes junction
capacitance. However, a minimum limit on this active area exists to provide for efficient fiber-to-detector
coupling.

electrical current (photocurrent) of the photodiode is linearly proportional to the input optical power.
Reverse-biased photodetectors remain linear over an extended range (6 decades or more) of photocurrent
before saturation occurs. Output saturation occurs at input optical power levels typically greater than 1</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

AVALANCHE PHOTODIODES
</p><p class="paragraph">An avalanche photodiode (APD) is a photodiode that internally amplifies the photocurrent by an
avalanche process. Figure 7-4 shows an example APD structure. In APDs, a large reverse-bias voltage,
typically over 100 volts, is applied across the active region. This voltage causes the electrons initially
generated by the incident photons to accelerate as they move through the APD active region. As these
electrons collide with other electrons in the semiconductor material, they cause a fraction of them to
become part of the photocurrent. This process is known as avalanche multiplication. Avalanche
multiplication continues to occur until the electrons move out of the active area of the APD.
</p><p class="paragraph">The gain of the APD can be changed by changing the reverse-bias voltage. A larger reverse-bias
voltage results in a larger gain. However, a larger reverse-bias voltage also results in increased noise
levels. Excess noise resulting from the avalanche multiplication process places a limit on the useful gain
of the APD. The avalanche process introduces excess noise because every photogenerated carrier does not
undergo the same multiplication. The noise properties of an APD are affected by the materials that the</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

attenuated and distorted (see figure 7-5). The fiber optic receiver must convert the input and amplify the
resulting electrical signal without distorting it to a point that other circuitry cannot use it.
</p><p class="paragraph">As stated previously, a fiber optic receiver consists of an optical detector, an amplifier, and other
circuitry. In most fiber optic systems, the optical detector is a PIN photodiode or APD. Receiver
performance varies depending on the type of detector used. The amplifier is generally described as having
two stages: the preamplifier and the postamplifier. The preamplifier is defined as the first stage of
amplification following the optical detector. The postamplifier is defined as the remaining stages of
amplification required to raise the detector's electrical signal to a level suitable for further signal
processing. The preamplifier is the dominant contributor of electrical noise in the receiver. Because of
this, its design has a significant influence in determining the sensitivity of the receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">The output circuitry processes the amplified signal into a form suitable for the interfacing circuitry.
For digital receivers, this circuitry may include low-pass filters and comparators. For analog receivers,
this circuitry may also include low-pass filters.

receiver performance. One goal in designing fiber optic receivers is to optimize receiver sensitivity. To
increase sensitivity, receiver noise resulting from signal-dependent shot noise and thermal noise must be
kept at a minimum. A more detailed discussion of receiver shot and thermal noise is provided later in this
chapter.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

RECEIVER NOISE
</p><p class="paragraph">Noise corrupts the transmitted signal in a fiber optic system. This means that noise sets a lower limit
on the amount of optical power required for proper receiver operation. There are many sources of noise in
fiber optic systems. They include the following:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Noise from the light source
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Noise from the interaction of light with the optical fiber
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Noise from the receiver itself
</h3><p class="paragraph">Because the intent of this chapter is to discuss optical detector and receiver properties, only noise
associated with the photodetection process is discussed. Receiver noise includes thermal noise, dark
current noise, and quantum noise. Noise is the main factor that limits receiver sensitivity.
</p><p class="paragraph">Noise introduced by the receiver is either signal dependent or signal independent. Signal dependent
noise results from the random generation of electrons by the incident optical power. Signal independent
noise is independent of the incident optical power level.
</p><p class="paragraph">Thermal noise is the noise resulting from the random motion of electrons in a conducting medium.
Thermal noise arises from both the photodetector and the load resistor. Amplifier noise also contributes to
thermal noise. A reduction in thermal noise is possible by increasing the value of the load resistor.
However, increasing the value of the load resistor to reduce thermal noise reduces the receiver bandwidth.
In APDs, the thermal noise is unaffected by the internal carrier multiplication.
</p><p class="paragraph">Shot noise is noise caused by current fluctuations because of the discrete nature of charge carriers.
Dark current and quantum noises are two types of noise that manifest themselves as shot noise. Dark
current noise results from dark current that continues to flow in the photodiode when there is no incident
light. Dark current noise is independent of the optical signal. In addition, the discrete nature of the
photodetection process creates a signal dependent shot noise called quantum noise. Quantum noise
results from the random generation of electrons by the incident optical radiation. In APDs, the random
nature of the avalanche process introduces an additional shot noise called excess noise. For further
information on the excess noise resulting from the avalanche process, refer to the avalanche photodiode
section.

RECEIVER DESIGN
</p><p class="paragraph">The simplest fiber optic receivers consist of only the optical detector and a load resistor. However,
the output signal of these simple receivers is not in a suitable form for most types of interfacing circuitry.
To produce a suitable signal, a preamplifier, a post amplifier, and other circuitry are generally included in
the receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">The choice of an optical detector and the design of the preamplifier help determine the operational
characteristics of the receiver. Fiber optic receivers using APDs have greater sensitivity than those using
PIN photodiodes. In addition, trade-offs are made in preamplifier designs to increase sensitivity while
optimizing bandwidth and dynamic range. The two basic types of amplifiers used in fiber optic receivers
are the high-impedance amplifier and the transimpedance amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">The high-impedance preamplifier is generally used with a large load resistor to improve sensitivity.
The large load resistor is used to reduce thermal noise. Although the high-impedance preamplifier
achieves high sensitivity, receiver bandwidth and dynamic range are limited. The transimpedance
preamplifier uses a low-noise, high-input impedance amplifier with negative feedback. This design
provides improvements in bandwidth and dynamic range with some degradation in sensitivity from an
increase in noise. For more information on receiver performance and design, refer to the reference
material listed in appendix 2.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Most of the discussion on fiber optic data links provided earlier in this training manual refers to
simple point-to-point links. A point-to-point fiber optic data link consists of an optical transmitter,
optical fiber, and an optical receiver. In addition, any splices or connectors used to join individual optical
fiber sections to each other and to the transmitter and the receiver are included. Figure 8-1 provides a
schematic diagram of a point-to-point fiber optic data link.
</p><p class="paragraph">A common fiber optic application is the full duplex link. This link consists of two simple point-to-
point links. The links transmit in opposite directions between the equipments. This application may be
configured using only one fiber. If configured with one fiber, fiber optic splitters are used at each end to
couple the transmit signal onto the fiber and receive signal to the detector.
</p><p class="paragraph">All fiber optic systems are simply sets of point-to-point fiber optic links. Different system topologies
arise from the different ways that point-to-point fiber optic links can be connected between equipments.
The term topology, as used here, refers to the configuration of various equipments and the fiber optic
components interconnecting them. This equipment may be computers, workstations, consoles, or other
equipments. Point-to-point links are connected to produce systems with linear bus, ring, star, or tree
topologies. Point-to-point fiber optic links are the basic building block of all fiber optic systems.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A linear bus topology consists of a single transmission line that is shared by a number of
equipments (see figure 8-2). Generally the transmission line in a fiber optic linear bus consists of two
optical lines, one for each direction of communication. Optical taps (optical splitters) are used by each
equipment to connect to each line. For each line, the optical tap couples signals from the line to the
equipment receiver and from the equipment transmitter onto the line. The connection between any two
equipments is a simple point-to-point link that contains the optical tap for each equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">A ring topology consists of equipments attached to one another in a closed loop or ring (see figure
8-3). The connection between each equipment is a simple point-to-point link. In some systems each
equipment may have an associated optical switch. In normal operation, the switch routes signals from the
fiber connected to the previous equipment to the receiver. It also routes signals from the transmitter to the
fiber connected to the next equipment. In bypass operation, the switch routes signals from the fiber
connected to the previous equipment to the fiber connected to the next equipment. In each case, the
connection between adjacent equipments on the ring is a simple point-to-point link through fiber,
connectors, and switches.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the coupler is connected to each equipment receiver. The connection between any two equipments is a
simple point-to-point link through the star coupler. If the center hub is an active equipment, the

</h2><p class="paragraph">While there are several ways to classify fiber optic links, this chapter classifies links according to the
modulation type: either digital or analog.Modulation is the process of varying one or more
characteristics of an optical signal to encode and convey information. Generally, the intensity of the
optical signal is modulated in fiber optic communications systems. Digital modulation implies that the
optical signal consists of discrete levels. Analog modulation implies that the intensity of the optical signal</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

digital transmission systems generally provide superior performance over analog transmission systems.
</p><p class="question">Q4. Define modulation.
DIGITAL TRANSMISSION
</p><p class="paragraph">A digital signal is a discontinuous signal that changes from one state to another in discrete steps. A
popular form of digital modulation is binary, or two level, digital modulation. In binary modulation the
optical signal is switched from a low-power level (usually off) to a high-power level. There are a number
of modulation techniques used in digital systems, but these will not be discussed here. For more
information on digital modulation techniques, refer to the references listed in appendix 2.
</p><p class="paragraph">Line coding is the process of arranging symbols that represent binary data in a particular pattern for
transmission. The most common types of line coding used in fiber optic communications include non-
return-to-zero (NRZ), return-to-zero (RZ), and biphase, or Manchester. Figure 8-6 illustrates NRZ, RZ,
and biphase (Manchester) encoding.
</p><p class="paragraph">NRZ code represents binary 1s and 0s by two different light levels that are constant during a bit
duration. The presence of a high-light level in the bit duration represents a binary 1, while a low-light
level represents a binary 0. NRZ codes make the most efficient use of system bandwidth. However, loss
of timing may result if long strings of 1s and 0s are present causing a lack of level transitions.
</p><p class="paragraph">RZ coding uses only half the bit duration for data transmission. In RZ encoding, a half period optical
pulse present in the first half of the bit duration represents a binary 1. While an optical pulse is present in
the first half of the bit duration, the light level returns to zero during the second half. A binary 0 is
represented by the absence of an optical pulse during the entire bit duration. Because RZ coding uses only
half the bit duration for data transmission, it requires twice the bandwidth of NRZ coding. Loss of timing
can occur if long strings of 0s are present.
</p><p class="paragraph">Biphase, or Manchester, encoding incorporates a transition into each bit period to maintain timing
information. In Manchester encoding, a high-to-low light level transition occurring in the middle of the
bit duration represents a binary 1. A low-to-high light level transition occurring in the middle of the bit
duration represents a binary 0.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">For further information on digital encoding schemes and modulation techniques, refer to the
reference material listed in appendix 2.
</p><p class="paragraph">Digital transmission offers an advantage with regard to the acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at
the optical receiver. Digital communications systems can tolerate large amounts of signal loss and
dispersion without impairing the ability of the receiver to distinguish a binary 1 from a binary 0. Digital
signalling also reduces the effects that optical source nonlinearities and temperature have on system
performance. Source nonlinearities and temperature variations can severely affect analog transmission.
Digital transmission provides superior performance in most complex systems (such as LANs) and long-
haul communications systems. In short-haul systems, the cost and complexity of analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog conversion equipment, in some cases, outweigh the benefits of digital transmission.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ANALOG-TRANSMISSION-8-6-">ANALOG TRANSMISSION
</h2><p class="paragraph">An analog signal is a continuous signal whose amplitude, phase, or some other property varies in a
direct proportion to the instantaneous value of a physical variable. An example of an analog signal is the
output power of an optical source whose intensity is a function of a continuous electrical input signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most analog fiber optic communications systems intensity modulate the optical source. In intensity
modulation, the intensity of the optical source's output signal is directly modulated by the incoming
electrical analog baseband signal. A baseband signal is a signal that is in its original form and has not
been changed by a modulation technique.
</p><p class="paragraph">In some cases, the optical source may be directly modulated by a incoming electrical signal that is
not a baseband signal. In these cases the original electrical signal generally modulates an electrical
subcarrier frequency. The most common form of analog subcarrier modulation in fiber optic systems is
frequency modulation (FM). The optical source is intensity modulated by the electrical subcarrier.
</p><p class="paragraph">While most fiber optic systems employ digital modulation techniques, there are certain applications
where analog modulation techniques are preferred. The transmission of video using analog techniques is
very popular, especially for shorter distances, where costs can be minimized and complex multiplexing
and timing equipment is unnecessary. The transmission of analog voice signals may also be attractive in
small, short-haul systems. In addition, fiber optic sensor systems may incorporate analog transmission.
Requirements that analog transmission places on applications include high signal-to-noise ratio and high
source linearity. While analog transmission can be attractive for short-haul or medium-haul systems, it is
unattractive for long-haul systems where digital techniques provide better performance.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic systems can be simple point-to-point data links or can involve more complex topologies.
However, it is generally necessary only to refer to point-to-point data links when discussing the process of
link design. Fiber optic systems that incorporate complex architectures can be simplified into a collection
of point-to-point data links before beginning the design process.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fiber optic system design is a complicated process that involves link definition and analysis. The
design process begins by providing a complete description of the communication requirements. This
information is used to develop the link architecture and define the communications links. System
designers must decide on the operational wavelength and types of components to use in the system. These
decisions affect numerous system and link design parameters, such as launched power, connection losses,
bandwidth, cost, and reliability.
</p><p class="paragraph">Once a system design has been formulated, each link is analyzed to determine its viability. Link
analysis involves calculating each link's power budget and risetime budget. Calculating a power budget
involves identifying all of the sources of loss in the fiber optic link. These losses and an additional safety
margin are then compared to the difference between the transmitter output power and the receiver
sensitivity. The difference between the transmitter output power and the receiver sensitivity is referred to
as the available power. If the sources of loss plus the safety margin are less than the available power in
the link, the design is viable.
</p><p class="paragraph">Calculating the risetime budget involves calculating the risetimes of the link transmitter and the
optical fiber. The composite optical transmitter/fiber risetime is referred to as the fiber exit risetime. If
the fiber exit risetime is less than the maximum input risetime specified for the link receiver, then the link
design is viable.
</p><p class="paragraph">If a proposed link design is not viable, the system designer will reevaluate various decisions made
earlier in the system design. These reevaluations may include using a different transmitter or receiver or
may involve redesigning the physical configuration of the link. Because there are many variables
involved in link design and analysis, it may take several iterations before the variables are combined in a
manner that ensures link operation. For more information of fiber optic system design, refer to the Navy
Fiber Optic System Design Standard.

the primary precautions that need to be emphasized when installing fiber optic systems on board ships are
as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Optical fibers or cables should never be bent at a radius of curvature less than a certain value,
called theminimum bend radius. Bending an optical fiber or cable at a radius smaller than the
minimum bend radius causes additional fiber loss.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Fiber optic cables should never be pulled tight or fastened over or through sharp corners or
cutting edges. Extremely sharp bends increase the fiber loss and may lead to fiber breakage.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Fiber optic connectors should always be cleaned before mating. Dirt in a fiber optic connection
will significantly increase the connection loss and may damage the connector.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Precautions must be taken so the cable does not become kinked or crushed during installation of
the hardware. Extremely sharp kinks or bends increase the fiber loss and may lead to fiber
breakage.
