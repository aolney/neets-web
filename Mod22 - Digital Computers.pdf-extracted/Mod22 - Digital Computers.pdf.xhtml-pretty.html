SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-1-1-">INTRODUCTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Digital computers are used in many facets of today's Navy. It would be impossible for one NEETS 
module to cover all the ways they are used in any depth. A few of these ways are covered later in this 
chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The purpose of this module is to acquaint you, the trainee, with the basic principles, techniques, and 
procedures associated with digital computers. We will use a desktop (personal) computer for most of the 
examples. Personal computers should be more familiar to you than the large mainframes, and the 
operating principles of personal computers relate directly to the operating principles of mainframe 
computers. You will learn the basic terminology used in the digital-computer world. When you have 
completed these chapters satisfactorily, you will have a better understanding of how computers are able to 
perform the demanding tasks assigned to them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If we were to define the word computer, we would say a computer is an instrument for performing 
mathematical operations, such as addition, multiplication, division, subtraction, integration, vector 
resolution, coordinate conversion, and special function generation at very high speeds. But the usage of 
computers goes well beyond the mathematical-operations level. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Computers have made possible military, scientific, and commercial advances that before were 
considered impossible. The mathematics involved in orbiting a satellite around the earth, for example, 
would require several teams of mathematicians for a lifetime. Now, with the aid of electronic digital 
computers, the conquest of space has become reality. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Computers are employed when repetitious calculations or the processing of large amounts of data are 
necessary. The most frequent applications are found in the military, scientific, and commercial fields. 
They are used in many varied projects, ranging from mail sorting, through engineering design, to the 
identification and destruction of enemy targets. The advantages of digital computers include speed, 
accuracy, reliability, and man-power savings. Frequently computers are able to take over routine jobs, 
releasing people for more important work; work that cannot be handled by a computer. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HISTORY-OF-COMPUTERS-1-2-">HISTORY OF COMPUTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The ever increasing need for faster and more efficient computers has created technological advances 
that can be considered amazing. Ever since humans discovered that it was necessary to count objects, we 
have been looking for easier ways to do it. Contrary to popular belief, digital computers are not a new 
idea. The abacus is a manually operated digital computer used in ancient civilizations and used to this day 
in the Orient (see fig. 1-1). For those who consider the abacus outdated, in a contest between a person 
using a modern calculator and a person using an abacus, the person using the abacus won. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The first mechanical adding machine (calculator) was invented by Blaise Pascal (French) in 1642. 
Twenty years later, an Englishman, Sir Samuel Morland, developed a more compact device that could 
multiply, add, and subtract. In 1682, Wilhelm Liebnitz (German) perfected a machine that could perform 
all the basic operations (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication), as well as extract the square 
root. Liebnitz's principles are still in use today in our modern electronic digital computers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As early as 1919, electronics entered the scene. An article by W. H. Eccles and F. W. Jordan 
described an electronic "trigger circuit" that could be used for automatic counting. It was the 
ECCLES-JORDAN multivibrator which was a little ahead of its time because a trigger circuit is one of 
many components required to make an electronic digital computer. Modern digital computers use these 
circuits, known as flip-flops, to store information, perform arithmetic operations, and control the timing 
sequences within the computer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Under the pressure of military needs in World War II, the science of electronic data processing made 
giant strides forward. In 1944, Harvard University developed a computing system known as the 
Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. After the initial design and construction, several improved 
models were built. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Meanwhile, at the University of Pennsylvania, a second system was being developed. This system, 
completed in 1946, was named ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). ENIAC 
employed 18,000 vacuum tubes in its circuitry; and in spite of these bulky, hot tubes, it worked quite 
successfully. The first problem assigned to ENIAC was a calculation in nuclear physics that would have 
taken 100 human-years to solve by conventional methods. The ENIAC solved the problem in 2 weeks, 
only 2 hours of which were actually spent on the calculation. The remainder of the time was spent 
checking the results and operational details. All modern computers have their basics in these two early 
developments conducted at Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In 1950, the UNIVAC I was developed. This machine was usually regarded as the most successful 
electronic data processor of its day. An outstanding feature of the UNIVAC I was that it checked its own 
results in each step of a problem; thus eliminating the need to run the problems more than once to ensure 
accuracy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">During the first outbreak of publicity about computers (especially when the UNIVAC predicted the 
outcome of the 1952 presidential election), the term "giant brain" caused much confusion and uneasiness. 
Many people assumed that science had created a thinking device superior to the human mind. Currently 
most people know better. By human standards the giant brain is nothing more than a talented idiot that is 
wholly dependent upon human instructions to perform even the simplest job. A computer is only a 
machine and definitely cannot think for itself. The field of artificial intelligence, however, is developing 
computer systems that can "think"; that is, mimic human thought in a specific area and improve 
performance with experience and operation. The field of digital computers is still in the growing stages. 
New types of circuitry and new ways of accomplishing things are continuing to be developed at a rapid 
rate. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the military field, the accomplishments of digital computers are many and varied. One outstanding 
example is in weapons systems. Most of the controlling is done by digital computers. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CLASSIFICATIONS-OF-COMPUTERS-1-3-">CLASSIFICATIONS OF COMPUTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Computers can be classified in many different ways. They can be classified by the type of 
technology they use (mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic), the purpose for which they were 
designed (general purpose or special purpose), by the type of data they can handle (digital or analog), by 
the amount they cost (from $50 to $10 million and up), and even by their physical size (handheld to room 
size). We will briefly explain mechanical, electromechanical, and electronic computers; special-purpose 
and general-purpose computers; and analog and digital computers. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MECHANICAL-COMPUTERS-1-3-">MECHANICAL COMPUTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Mechanical or analog computers are devices used for the computation of mathematical problems. 
They are made up of components, such as integrators, sliding racks, cams, gears, springs, and driveshafts. 
Figure 1-2 shows a typical mechanical computer used by the Navy. These computers are analog in nature, 
and their physical size depends on the number of functions the computer has to perform. In an analog 
computer, a continuing input will give a constantly updated output. This being perfect for target 
information, the Navy uses these analog computers primarily for gun fire control. As systems for naval 
weapons became more and more complex, the need for a different computer was apparent. The functions 
that had to be performed had increased the size of the computer to an unreasonable scale. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTROMECHANICAL-COMPUTERS-1-4-">ELECTROMECHANICAL COMPUTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Electromechanical computers came next and differ from mechanical computers in that they use 
electrical components to perform some of the calculations and to increase the accuracy. Because the 
electrical components are smaller than their mechanical counterparts, the size of the computer was 
reduced, even though it performs more functions. The components used to perform the calculations are 
devices such as synchros, servos, resolvers, amplifiers, servo amplifiers, summing networks, 
potentiometers, and linear potentiometers. Figure 1-3 shows one of the Navy's electromechanical 
computers. These computers are used in gun fire control and missile fire control. Even though they are 
better than the mechanical computer, they still have their drawbacks. Of prime importance is that they are 
special-purpose computers. This means they can only be used for one job, dependent on their design 
characteristics. By today's Navy standards they are still too large, and the maintenance time on them is 
excessive. The need for a more accurate, reliable, versatile, and smaller computer was recognized. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Next came electronic computers. The early electronic computers' mathematical processes were 
solved by using electrical voltages only, applied to elements such as amplifiers, summing networks, 
differentiating, and integrating circuits. The weak link in this type of electrical computation was the 
vacuum tube. To correct this, transistors which consume less power and last longer than vacuum tubes 
were used in the amplifiers. Through technological research and development, we have progressed from 
tubes, to transistors, to miniaturized circuits, to integrated circuitry. These advances have made it possible 
to reduce the size and weight of our computers. Figure 1-4 is an example of one of our modern electronic 
digital computers. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SPECIAL-PURPOSE-COMPUTERS-1-6-">SPECIAL-PURPOSE COMPUTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A special-purpose computer, as the name implies, is designed to perform a specific operation and 
usually satisfies the needs of a particular type of problem. Such a computer system would be useful in 
weather predictions, satellite tracking, or oil exploration. While a special-purpose computer may have 
many of the same features found in a general-purpose computer, its applicability to a particular problem is 
a function of its design rather than to a stored program. The instructions that control it are built directly 
into the computer, which makes for a more efficient and effective operation. A drawback of this 
specialization, however, is the computer's lack of versatility. It cannot be used to perform other 
operations. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-GENERAL-PURPOSE-COMPUTERS-1-6-">GENERAL-PURPOSE COMPUTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">General-purpose computers are designed to perform a wide variety of functions and operations. You 
will probably use this type of computer. A general-purpose computer is able to perform a wide variety of 
operations because it can store and execute different programs in its internal storage. Unfortunately, 
having this ability is often achieved at the expense of speed and efficiency. In most situations, however, 
you will find that having this flexibility makes this compromise a most acceptable one. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ANALOG-COMPUTERS-1-6-">ANALOG COMPUTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">All analog computers are special-purpose computers. They are designed to measure continuous 
electrical or physical conditions, such as current, voltage, flow, temperature, length, or pressure. They 
then convert these measurements into related mechanical or electrical quantities. The early analog 
computers were strictly mechanical or electromechanical devices. They did not operate on digits (in 
binary notation, either of the characters, 0 and 1). If digits were involved at all, they were obtained </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">indirectly. Your wrist watch (if nondigital); your car's speedometer; and oil pressure, temperature, and 
fuel gauges are also considered analog computers. The output of an analog computer is often an 
adjustment to the control of a machine; such as, an adjustment to a valve that controls the flow of steam to 
a turbine generator or a temperature setting to control the ovens in the ship's galley for baking. Analog 
computers are also used for controlling processes. To do so, they must convert analog data to digital form, 
process it, and then convert the digital results back to analog form. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You should know that a digital computer can process data with greater accuracy than an analog 
computer, but an analog computer can process data faster than a digital computer, in some systems. Some 
computers combine the functions of both analog and digital computers. They are called hybrid computers. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DIGITAL-COMPUTERS-1-7-">DIGITAL COMPUTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Digital computers perform arithmetic and logic functions on separate discrete data, like numbers, or 
combinations of discrete data, such as name, rate, and division. This makes them different from analog 
computers that operate on continuous data, like measuring temperature changes. We generally use digital 
computers for business and scientific data processing. The following are examples: 
</p><p class="paragraph">Accounting—Computers are ideal for keeping payroll records, printing paychecks, billing 
customers, preparing tax returns, and taking care of many of the other accounting tasks in an organization. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Recordkeeping—Computers can record information like inventories and personnel files. They can 
also keep track of books checked out of a library. Airline ticket counters are much more efficient than 
they used to be, thanks to centralized reservation computers that can be reached over the telephone lines. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Industrial Uses—Industrial computers save considerable time and reduce waste by efficiently 
performing hundreds of industrial tasks, ranging from filling sales orders and routing parts to various 
locations on an assembly line, to designing earthquake-resistant structures, and controlling an entire oil 
refinery. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Science—The research and development applications are the most numerous. Digital computers are 
being used to do lengthy and complicated mathematical calculations millions of times faster than human 
beings. They are also used to collect, store, and evaluate data from experiments, analyze weather patterns, 
forecast crop statistics, and, believe it or not, design other computers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Word Processing—Remember, these words were typed into a desktop computer! Word processing 
is among the most common applications for personal computers. If you have not discovered the 
advantages of computer writing, it's time to visit a computer dealer for a personalized demonstration. 
</p><p class="paragraph">None of this work could be performed by a computer without first instructing the computer how to 
do it by means of a list of instructions called a program. The instructions in the program must be written 
in one of the languages the computer understands. The most popular generic term for computer programs 
is software (this is covered in chapter 3). Hardware (covered in chapter 2), of course, refers to the 
computer and related equipment. It is easy to say that both computer hardware and software are 
interdependent because neither can perform useful work without the other. Digital computers may be 
either special or general purpose. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ACCURACY-OF-COMPUTERS-1-7-">ACCURACY OF COMPUTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The fundamental difference between analog and digital computers is that digital computers deal with 
discrete quantities such as beads on an abacus, notches on a toothed wheel, or electrical pulses, while 
analog computers deal with continuous physical variables such as electrical voltages or mechanical shaft 
rotations. Computation with analog computers depends on the relation of information to a measurement </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

either a digital or an analog system as follows. In the digital method (fig. 1-5, view A), you use an adding 
machine and count the boards one by one. In the analog method (fig. 1-5, view B), you draw a string 
(marked off in inches for the width of each board including the gap) over the length of the fence, then 
measure the length of the string. The number of boards may then be determined by dividing the length of 
string by the number of inches per board.

</p><p class="paragraph">The accuracy of an analog computer is restricted to the accuracy with which physical quantities can 
be sensed and displayed. This, in turn, is related to the quality of the components used in constructing the 
computer; for example, the tolerance of electrical resistors or mechanical shafts and the quality of the 
output equipment. In an analog computer, for example, if the constant is represented by a voltage, it 
probably could be read only to the third decimal place. 
</p><p class="paragraph">On the other hand, the accuracy of a digital computer is governed by the number of significant 
figures carried in the computations. This, in turn, is determined by the computer's design. In a digital 
computer, the number of decimal places in the constant could be many, depending on the design of the 
computer processing unit. The digital computer is, therefore, capable of higher precision and accuracy. 
However, a computer, regardless of its accuracy, would do you no good if the wrong one were chosen for 
a given task.

system is said to belong to a specific "generation." Each generation indicates a significant change in 
computer design. The UNIVAC I represents the first generation. Currently we are moving toward the 
fourth generation. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FIRST-GENERATION-1-10-">FIRST GENERATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The computers of the first generation (1951-1958) were physically very large machines characterized 
by the vacuum tube (fig. 1-6). Because they used vacuum tubes, they were very unreliable, required a lot 
of power to run, and produced so much heat that adequate air conditioning was critical to protect the 
computer parts. Compared to today's computers, they had slow input and output devices, were slow in 
processing, and had small storage capacities. Many of the internal processing functions were measured in 
thousandths of a second (millisecond). The software (computer program) used on first generation 
computers was unsophisticated and machine oriented. This meant that the programmers had to code all 
computer instructions and data in actual machine language. They also had to keep track of where 
instructions and data were stored in memory. Using such a machine language (see chapter 3) was efficient 
for the computer but difficult for the programmer.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The computers of the second generation (1959-1963), were characterized by transistors (fig. 1-7) 
instead of vacuum tubes. Transistors were smaller, less expensive, generated almost no heat, and required 
very little power. Thus second generation computers were smaller, required less power, and produced a 
lot less heat. The use of small, long lasting transistors also increased processing speeds and reliability. 
Cost performance also improved. The storage capacity was greatly increased with the introduction of 
magnetic disk storage and the use of magnetic cores for main storage. High speed card readers, printers, </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">and magnetic tape units were also introduced. Internal processing speeds increased. Functions were 
measured in millionths of a second (microseconds). Like the first generation, a particular computer of the 
second generation was designed to process either scientific or business oriented problems but not both. 
The software was also improved. Symbolic machine languages or assembly languages were used instead 
of actual machine languages. This allowed the programmer to use mnemonic operation codes for 
instruction operations and symbolic names for storage locations or stored variables. Compiler languages 
were also developed for the second generation computers (see chapter 3). 
</p><p class="paragraph">

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THIRD-GENERATION-1-11-">THIRD GENERATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The computers of this generation (1964-1970), many of which are still in use, are characterized by 
miniaturized circuits. This reduces the physical size of computers even more and increases their durability 
and internal processing speeds. One design employs solid-state logic microcircuits (fig. 1-8) for which 
conductors, resistors, diodes, and transistors have been miniaturized and combined on half-inch ceramic 
squares. Another smaller design uses silicon wafers on which the circuit and its components are etched. 
The smaller circuits allow for faster internal processing speeds resulting in faster execution of 
instructions. Internal processing speeds are measured in billionths of a second (nanoseconds). The faster 
computers make it possible to run jobs that were considered impractical or impossible on first or second 
generation equipment. Because the miniature components are more reliable, maintenance is reduced. New 
mass storage, such as the data cell, was introduced during this generation, giving a storage capacity of 
over 100 million characters. Drum and disk capacities and speed have been increased, the portable disk 
pack has been developed, and faster, higher density magnetic tapes have come into use. Considerable 
improvements were made to card readers and printers, while the overall cost has been greatly reduced. 
Applications using online processing, real-time processing, time sharing, multiprogramming, 
multiprocessing, and teleprocessing have become widely accepted. More on this in later chapters. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Manufacturers of third generation computers are producing a series of similar and compatible 
computers. This allows programs written for one computer model to run on most larger models of the 
same series. Most third generation systems are designed to handle both scientific and business data 
processing applications. Improved program and operating software has been designed to provide better 
control, resulting in faster processing. These enhancements are of significant importance to the computer 
operator. They simplify system initialization (booting) and minimize the need for inputs to the program 
from a keyboard (console intervention) by the operator. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FOURTH-GENERATION-AND-BEYOND-1-12-">FOURTH GENERATION AND BEYOND 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The computers of the fourth generation are not easily distinguished from earlier generations, yet 
there are some striking and important differences. The manufacturing of integrated circuits has advanced 
to the point where thousands of circuits (active components) can be placed on a silicon wafer only a 
fraction of an inch in size (the computer on a chip). This has led to what is called large scale integration 
(LSI) and very large scale integration (VLSI). As a result of this technology, computers are significantly 
smaller in physical size and lower in cost. Yet they have retained large memory capacities and are ultra 
fast. Large mainframe computers are increasingly complex. Medium sized computers can perform the 
same tasks as large third generation computers. An entirely new breed of computers called 
microcomputers  (fig. 1-9) and minicomputers are small and inexpensive, and yet they provide a large 
amount of computing power. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

miniaturization. You can expect to see the power of large mainframe computers on a single super chip. 
Massive data bases, such as the Navy's supply system, may be written into read-only memory (ROM) on 
a piece of equipment no bigger than a desktop calculator (more about ROM in chapter 2). The future 
challenge will not be in increasing the storage or increasing the computer's power, but rather in properly 
and effectively using the computing power available. This is where software (programs such as 
assemblers, report generators, subroutine libraries, compilers, operating systems, and applications 
programs) will come into play (see chapter 3). Some believe developments in software and in learning 
how to use these extraordinary, powerful machines we already possess will be far more important than 
further developments in hardware over the next 10 to 20 years. As a result, the next 20 years (during your 
career) may be even more interesting and surprising than the last 20 years.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-USES-OF-A-DIGITAL-COMPUTER-1-14-">USES OF A DIGITAL COMPUTER 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In the modern computer world of today, the uses of the digital computer are almost as limitless as a 
person's imagination. New and better programs are being written everyday for easier and greater uses. 
Consider how many mathematicians it would take to put an astronaut in orbit around the moon, but it only 
takes one computer. Think back to the days without word processing when a document had to be retyped 
entirely when any changes were needed. Think back to the days of using an adding machine to prepare 
and revise budgets and accounting reports. Let's look at three of the primary uses of general-purpose 
digital computers in the Navy: word processing, accounting/recordkeeping, and work center uses. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WORD-PROCESSING-1-14-">WORD PROCESSING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">One of the more widespread uses of the computer is word processing. The word processor can be 
considered a typewriter with a display screen. To the hundreds of thousands of word processor users, the 
computer is nothing more than a typewriter. Both have keyboards, and both have a mechanism for making 
the image of the character you strike on the keyboard appear on some type of visual medium. When using 
an electric typewriter, the process is strictly mechanical. When you press the key, it causes the type face 
to strike the paper, and in so doing, it leaves an impression. In the computer, the process is more indirect. 
A program stored in the computer's memory causes a visual representation to appear on a crt (cathode-ray 
tube) or at a printer. However, from the view point of the user, the result is the same, a printed document. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The great advantage of computers over typewriters is in correcting errors. In the past, correcting a 
document with a typewriter has meant typing it all over again. Since computers allow the movement of 
information from one part of memory to another, it is possible to make many changes on a document, and 
print the result. If the document is still not correct, only the changes need to be entered. The use of 
computers in this particular way came to be known as word processing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A further breakthrough came with the development of word-processing application programs for 
microcomputers. These programs cost a fraction of their office machine counterparts, and could be run on 
general-purpose microcomputers. This was unique because general-purpose microcomputers could be 
used for functions such as spreadsheets, data base management systems, and programming in common 
computer languages. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Navy saw the obvious uses to which microcomputers using the word processing programs could 
be put. Some of these are manuscript writing, memorandum writing, identification-card application filing, 
and recordkeeping. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">There are virtually unlimited applications for the computer in today's modern business world, from 
basic accounting functions to controlling the manufacture of products, and of course, keeping records of 
these actions. Six standard systems dealing with accounting applications are widely accepted. These 
systems are (1) order entry; (2) inventory control; (3) accounts receivable; (4) accounts payable; (5) 
general ledger; and (6) payroll. (Figure 1-10 shows a simplified flowchart of payroll.) The area of 
recordkeeping has two requirements, legal and audit. The Navy has included similar functions in its 
Shipboard Non-Tactical ADP Program for work center use. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">WORK CENTER USES (SNAP II) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Every Navy rating has the responsibility for some element of ship's maintenance. And for every rate, 
recordkeeping has been a "tough nut to turn," an administrative chore that goes along with the work to be 
done, but takes a "back burner" position to the physical maintenance of the ship and equipment. Today, 
aboard some ships and soon aboard most, much of that hassle will be done with a SNAP. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The Navy has looked at the paperwork blizzard of recordkeeping responsibility of the essential 
records and reports that must be generated, and has offered relief to the fleet. This is in the form of 
S-N-A-P, which stands for Shipboard Non-Tactical ADP Program. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SNAP II is a modern shipboard computer system designed to support shipboard and intermediate-
level maintenance, supply, financial, and administrative functions. If this sounds confusing, it really isn't, 
for the systems are designed to be user-friendly; that is, operating instructions are written in everyday 
English. Figure 1-11 shows the AN/UYK-62 (V) Data Processing Set. This is the SNAP II computer and 
its associated hardware. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Over the next 3 years, new functions will be added to SNAP to support more of the ship's 
administrative workload. Pay, personnel, food service, ship's store, PMS, training, medical and dental 
data are all to be added to SNAP systems. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The SNAP concept is to take the power of the modern computer, the ability to process information, 
and put that power in the hands of the work center sailors. The sailors can use the system to reduce the 
labor associated with the paperwork function. User terminals are placed in the different work centers for 
use by the work center supervisor. Each work center has a different access code. This access code or 
password prevents unauthorized entry into the main computer's program. Different levels of entry are also 
defined. The levels depend on a work center's need. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Information stored in the computer for a typical work center normally has the following items that 
can be updated by the work center supervisor. COSAL (coordinated onboard ship/shore allowance list) is 
a listing of the repair parts that are allowed to be kept onboard ship, at all times. APL (allowance parts </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

EIC (equipment identification code) identifies a system, sub-system, or equipment. SHIP'S FORCE 
WORK LIST is a listing of all work to be performed by a certain work center during a given time period. 
CSMP (current ship's maintenance projects) provides shipboard maintenance managers with a 
consolidated listing of deferred maintenance to manage and control its accomplishment. These are but a 
few of the uses of SNAP II that can be updated by the work center supervisor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Although the information is usually viewed on a display screen (cathode-ray tube), printed (hard) 
copies can be obtained. Today, hard copy output from SNAP can be sent to higher authorities in lieu of 
written reports. In the future, these hard copy transmittals may be replaced by disks or tapes containing 
the same data. In some cases, the shipboard computers will have an extra telephone wire to the pier or 
tender, and information can be exchanged electronically. 
</p><p class="paragraph">And there are other important benefits. In practice, the system expedites the storage and retrieval of 
information the Navy has about its ships. In turn, information that is more accessible means a more timely 
supply of parts, an improved aid to planners on when and how long to schedule ships' overhauls, and 
updated information for making decisions whether to place additional or remove unnecessary shipboard 
equipment. These decisions are now made by laboriously using stacks of printed files. SNAP can sort 
through these files electronically so Navy planners can make more effective and timely decisions.

many of the physical and electronic security requirements.

you to run application programs like word processing or recordkeeping programs. So let's begin with the 
operating system. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OPERATING-SYSTEM-1-18-">OPERATING SYSTEM 
</h2><p class="paragraph">An operating system is simply a set of programs and routines that lets you and other programs use 
the computer. A digital computer uses one central set of programs called the operating system to manage 
execution of other programs and to perform common functions like read, write, or print. Other programs, 
or you the user, can order the operating system to perform these common functions. These orders are 
called system calls when other programs use them, or simply commands when you put them through the 
keyboard. 
</p><p class="paragraph">First, you must load the operating system into the computer so we, and our programs, can use the 
computer. Remember, in our example, we have a desktop computer with two floppy disk drives, named A 
and B. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Booting the System 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Each desktop computer has a built-in program called "bootstrap loader." When you turn the 
computer on, this program tries to load, or "boot," an external operating system from disk, usually from 
drive A, into the computer's internal memory. Disk drive B is usually used for data file disks. The term 
boot comes from the idea of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. The computer loads a little program 
from the disk that tells it how to load a second, bigger program (the operating system). The operating 
system then tells it how to load another program (an applications program or utility program) to perform a 
specific job or function. The first thing you need to learn about using a computer is that computers and 
their programs are very particular. They require complete accuracy and attention to detail on your part. 
They are not good at guessing what you meant. You'll quickly learn there are a few things that can go 
wrong at this point, in which case the computer will give you an error message on the display screen 
similar to this:

</p><p class="paragraph">Another error message you might receive at this time is: 
</p><h3 class="subsection">No System 
</h3><p class="paragraph">This means the computer is reading a properly inserted floppy disk, but the disk does not have an 
operating system on it. Replace the disk with one that does contain the operating system. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Once the operating system is properly booted (loaded), you will see a display similar to this: 
</p><h3 class="subsection">A&gt; 
</h3><p class="paragraph">You now have what is called a prompt. At this point you can tell the computer what to do next, such 
as run an application program for example: word processing, accounting, or recordkeeping. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Running an Application Program 
</h3><p class="paragraph">To load an application program into the computer from drive A, you put the disk with the application 
program in disk drive A. Next you type the name of the program following the operating system prompt 
(A&gt;). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">A&gt;WORDPROC 
</h3><p class="paragraph">This tells the system what program to load and run; in this case Word Processing. The computer then 
does what the application program tells it. If the application is word processing, the system is ready for 
you to type a new document, correct an existing document, print a document, and so on. You'll learn more 
about both the operating system and application programs in chapter 3. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each application program will have its own set of instructions to follow. In addition to printed 
documentation, many will include online HELP screens you can display while you are working. These 
will tell you how to perform a given function or operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another area that needs your constant attention relates to handling floppy disks and making backup 
copies to be sure your work is not lost.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Floppy disks (fig. 1-13) are one means by which you will store data (files that you create) either 
directly or in backing up the data you store on hard (or fixed) disk. For this reason, and because floppy 
disks are extremely fragile, you should follow certain guidelines to ensure their proper care and handling. 
This includes properly labeling and backing up disks. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

actual disk is protected most of the time; however, there are areas that are exposed. These areas are the 
timing hole and the read/write slots. Touching an exposed area can ruin that particular area. If you are 
familiar with Murphy's Law, you will realize the area you ruin will invariably contain the most important 
data on that disk. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Storage 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Never bend, fold, or otherwise distort the shape of a disk. Never place heavy objects such as books 
on top of disks. Store disks in the box they came in, or in filing containers that are specifically designed 
for storing disks. Try to store disks vertically, but if you do store disks horizontally, do not stack more 
than 10 disks.

a negative effect.

material, and if you have ever seen a phonograph record that has been exposed to heat or sunlight, you 
have some idea of the damage that can result from exposure. Typically, disks will operate only between 
10 and 50 degrees Celsius (50 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit). They will accept a relative humidity of 10% to 
80%. 
</p><p class="paragraph">X-RAYS.—There is some question about the effect that airport x-ray machines have on disks. It has 
been the normal experience that the walk-through x-ray machines at airports have no effect on floppy 
disks; however, this is not to say there will be no effect. It is up to you because these disks contain the 
data you work with and need. You may not want to take the chance the disks will be affected. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Labeling 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When labeling the outside of a floppy disk, write the label before attaching it to the disk. Never use a 
pencil or ballpoint pen to write on a label once that label has been attached to a disk. When you use an 
instrument with a sharp point to write on the label, you can actually etch into the surface of the disk 
underneath the protective sheath, thereby destroying that disk. If you must write on a label once it has 
been attached to a disk, use a felt-tip marker. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Data Backup 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In virtually all computer systems, the possibility exists for errors to occur that accidentally alter or 
destroy the data stored in the data bases or files. This may occur because of natural disasters, such as fire, 
flood, or power outages. It may occur through operator error. It may occur through equipment 
malfunction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">It is essential, therefore, to provide a means to ensure that any data lost can be recovered. The most 
common method is backup files. A backup file is merely a copy of a file. If for some reason the file or 
data base is destroyed or becomes unusable, the backup file can be used to recreate the file or data base. 
Two media are commonly used for backup: disk or tape. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Disk—The most common method of creating a backup for a microcomputer is to use a floppy disk 
and the diskcopy procedure. This is accomplished by using the original data base or file and copying the 
information onto a blank floppy disk. The instructions for this procedure will be provided with the 
particular computer and program you are using. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Tape—Another method of creating a backup is to use magnetic tape. The information contained on 
your disk, whether it is a data base or file, can be copied onto a tape. The instructions for this procedure 
will also be provided with the particular computer and program you are using.

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY 
</h1><p class="paragraph">This chapter has presented information on the history and classification of computers. It introduced 
you to electronic digital computers, their uses and operation. The information that follows summarizes the 
important points of this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Early computers were MECHANICAL or ELECTROMECHANICAL. ELECTRONIC 
COMPUTERS came into use in the 1940s. 
</p><p class="paragraph">ANALOG COMPUTERS are special-purpose computers designed to measure continuous electrical 
or physical conditions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DIGITAL COMPUTERS are special- or general-purpose computers designed to perform 
arithmetic and logic functions on separate discrete data. They are generally used for business and 
scientific data processing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Digital computers have evolved through four generations: vacuum tubes, transistors, miniaturized 
circuits, and integrated circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">WORD PROCESSING is one of the most widespread uses of desktop computers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">ACCOUNTING AND RECORDKEEPING are also major uses of computers. Included are order 
entry, inventory control, accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, and payroll. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Navy's SHIPBOARD NON-TACTICAL ADP PROGRAM (SNAP) consists of computers 
used by work center supervisors for logistic and administrative support. This system expedites the storage 
and retrieval of information the Navy has about its ships. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A DESKTOP (PERSONAL) COMPUTER is a microcomputer with at least a display screen, 
keyboard, floppy disk drive, and printer. It may also have additional devices such as a second floppy or a 
hard disk drive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An OPERATING SYSTEM is loaded into the computer to let you and other programs use the 
computer. It also provides common functions like read, write, and print. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You can direct the computer to run an APPLICATION PROGRAM by telling the operating system 
the name of program to run. Common application programs are word processing, accounting, and 
recordkeeping. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You will probably be using FLOPPY DISKS for data storage and backup. To ensure you don't 
damage a disk, use care in handling, labeling and storing the disks. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="learningobjective">1. Explain the cpu and describe the functions of the different sections. 
</p><p class="learningobjective">2. Categorize the types of storage and their functions.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-2-1-">INTRODUCTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Components or tools of a computer system are grouped into one of two categories, hardware or 
software. We refer to the machines that compose a computer system as hardware. This hardware includes 
all the mechanical, electrical, electronic, and magnetic devices within the computer itself (the central 
processing unit) and all related peripheral devices (printers, magnetic tape units, magnetic disk drive 
units, and so on). These devices will be covered in this chapter to show you how they function and how 
they relate to one another. Take a few minutes to study figure 2-1. It shows the functional units of a 
computer system: the  inputs, the central processing unit (cpu), and the outputs. The inputs can be on any 
storage medium from punched cards, paper tape, or magnetic ink to magnetic tape, disk, or drum; or they 
can be entries from a console keyboard or a cathode-ray tube (crt) terminal. The data from one or more of 
these inputs will be processed by the central processing unit to produce output. The output may be in 
punched cards or paper tape, on magnetic tape, disk, or drum, or it may be printed reports or information 
displayed on a console typewriter or crt terminal. The figure also shows the data flow, instruction flow, 
and flow of control. We'll start our hardware discussion with the cpu and then move into storage media 
(disk, tape, and drum). We'll end the chapter with a discussion of input/output devices and how they 
work. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The brain of a computer system is the central processing unit, which we generally refer to as the cpu 
or mainframe. The central processing unit IS THE COMPUTER. It is the cpu that processes the data 
transferred to it from one of the various input devices, and then transfers either the intermediate or final 
results of the processing to one of many output devices. A central control section and work areas are 
required to perform calculations or manipulate data. The cpu is the computing center of the system. It 
consists of a control section, internal storage section (main or primary memory), and arithmetic-logic 
section (fig. 2-1). Each of the sections within the cpu serves a specific function and has a particular 
relationship to the other sections within the cpu. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CONTROL-SECTION-2-2-">CONTROL SECTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The control section may be compared to a telephone exchange because it uses the instructions 
contained in the program in much the same manner as the telephone exchange uses telephone numbers. 
When a telephone number is dialed, it causes the telephone exchange to energize certain switches and 
control lines to connect the dialing phone with the phone having the number dialed. In a similar manner, </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">each programmed instruction, when executed, causes the control section to energize certain control lines, 
enabling the computer to perform the function or operation indicated by the instruction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The program may be stored in the internal circuits of the computer (computer memory), or it may be 
read instruction-by-instruction from external media. The internally stored program type of computer, 
generally referred to only as a stored-program computer, is the most practical type to use when speed and 
fully automatic operation are desired. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Computer programs may be so complex that the number of instructions plus the parameters 
necessary for program execution will exceed the memory capacity of a stored-program computer. When 
this occurs, the program may be sectionalized; that is, broken down into modules. One or more modules 
are then stored in computer memory and the rest in an easily accessible auxiliary memory. Then as each 
module is executed producing the desired results, it is swapped out of internal memory and the next 
succeeding module read in. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to the commands that tell the computer what to do, the control unit also dictates how and 
when each specific operation is to be performed. It is also active in initiating circuits that locate any 
information stored within the computer or in an auxiliary storage device and in moving this information 
to the point where the actual manipulation or modification is to be accomplished. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The four major types of instructions are (1) transfer, (2) arithmetic, (3) logic, and (4) control. 
Transfer instructions are those whose basic function is to transfer (move) data from one location to 
another. Arithmetic instructions are those that combine two pieces of data to form a single piece of data 
using one of the arithmetic operations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Logic instructions transform the digital computer into a system that is more than a high-speed adding 
machine. Using logic instructions, the programmer may construct a program with any number of alternate 
sequences. For example, through the use of logic instructions, a computer being used for maintenance 
inventory will have one sequence to follow if the number of a given item on hand is greater than the order 
amount and another sequence if it is smaller. The choice of which sequence to use will be made by the 
control section under the influence of the logic instruction. Logic instructions, thereby, provide the 
computer with the ability to make decisions based on the results of previously generated data. That is, the 
logic instructions permit the computer to select the proper program sequence to be executed from among 
the alternatives provided by the programmer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Control instructions are used to send commands to devices not under direct command of the control 
section, such as input/output units or devices. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ARITHMETIC-LOGIC-SECTION-2-3-">ARITHMETIC-LOGIC SECTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The arithmetic-logic section performs all arithmetic operations-adding, subtracting, multiplying, and 
dividing. Through its logic capability, it tests various conditions encountered during processing and takes 
action based on the result. As indicated by the solid arrows in figure 2-1, data flows between the 
arithmetic-logic section and the internal storage section during processing. Specifically, data is transferred 
as needed from the internal storage section to the arithmetic-logic section, processed, and returned to the 
internal storage section. At no time does processing take place in the storage section. Data may be 
transferred back and forth between these two sections several times before processing is completed. The 
results are then transferred from internal storage to an output unit, as indicated by the solid arrow (fig. 
2-1). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">MEMORY (INTERNAL STORAGE) SECTION 
</h3><p class="paragraph">All memory (internal storage) sections must contain facilities to store computer data or instructions 
(that are intelligible to the computer) until these instructions or data are needed in the performance of the 
computer calculations. Before the stored-program computer can begin to process input data, it is first 
necessary to store in its memory a sequence of instructions, and tables of constants and other data it will 
use in its computations. The process by which these instructions and data are read into the computer is 
called loading. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Actually, the first step in loading instructions and data into a computer is to manually place enough 
instructions into memory using the keyboard or electronically using an operating system (discussed in 
chapter 1), so that these instructions can be used to bring in more instructions as desired. In this manner a 
few instructions are used to bootstrap more instructions. Some computers make use of an auxiliary 
(wired) memory that permanently stores the bootstrap program, thereby making manual loading 
unnecessary. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The memory (internal storage) section of a computer is essentially an electronically operated file 
cabinet. It has a large number (usually several hundred thousand) of storage locations; each referred to as 
a storage address or register. Every item of data and program instruction read into the computer during the 
loading process is stored or filed in a specific storage address and is almost instantly accessible. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-1. What is the brain of a computer system? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-2. How many sections make up the central processing unit? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-3. What are the names of the sections that make up the cpu?

</p><p class="paragraph">Q-5. What are the four major types of instructions in the control section?

processing and take action based on the result?

</p><p class="paragraph">Q-8. What is the process by which instructions and data are read into a computer? 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TYPES-OF-INTERNAL-STORAGE-2-4-">TYPES OF INTERNAL STORAGE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">You already know that the internal storage section is the holding area in which instructions and data 
are kept. For the control section to control and coordinate all processing activity, it must be able to locate 
each instruction and data item in storage. About now, you are probably wondering how the control section 
is able to find these instructions and data items. To understand this, let's look at storage as nothing more 
than a collection of mailboxes. Each mailbox has a unique address and represents a location in memory as 
shown in figure 2-2. Like the mail in your mailbox, the contents of a storage location can change, but the 
number on your mailbox or memory address always remains the same. In this manner, a particular 
program instruction or data item that is held in storage can be located by knowing its address. Some 
computers can address each character of data in memory directly. Others address computer words which 
contain a group of characters at a single address. Each computer word contains a group of characters at a </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MAGNETIC-CORE-STORAGE-2-5-">MAGNETIC CORE STORAGE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Although magnetic core storage is no longer as popular as it once was, we will cover it in some 
detail because its concepts are easily understood and apply generally to the more integrated 
semiconductor and bubble-type memories. Magnetic core storage is made up of tiny doughnut-shaped 
rings made of ferrite (iron), that are strung on a grid of very thin wires (fig. 2-3). Since data in computers 
is stored in binary form (refer to NEETS, module 13), a two-state device is needed to represent the two 
binary digits (bits), 0 for off and 1 for on. In core storage, each ferrite ring can represent a 0 or 1 bit, 
depending on its magnetic state. If magnetized in one direction, it represents a 1 bit, and if magnetized in 
the opposite direction, it represents a 0 bit. These cores are magnetized by sending an electric current 
through the wires on which the core is strung. It is this direction of current that determines the state of 
each core.

</p><h3 class="subsection">SEMICONDUCTOR STORAGE (THE SILICON CHIP) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor memory consists of hundreds of thousands of tiny electronic circuits etched on a 
silicon chip (fig. 2-4). Each of these electronic circuits is called a bit cell and can be in either an off or on 
state to represent a 0 or 1 bit, depending on whether or not current is flowing in that cell. Another name 
you will hear used for semiconductor memory chips is integrated circuits (ICs). Developments in 
technology have led to large scale integration (LSI), which means that more and more circuits can be 
squeezed onto the same silicon chip. Companies are even manufacturing very large scale integrated 
circuits (VLSI), which means even further miniaturization.

</p><p class="paragraph">Some of the advantages of semiconductor storage are fast internal processing speeds, high reliability, 
low power consumption, high density (many circuits), and low cost. However, there is a drawback to this 
type of storage. It is volatile, which means all data in memory is lost when the power supply is removed. 
Should the power on your computer fail and you have no backup power supply, all the stored data is lost. 
This is not the case with magnetic core storage. Core storage is nonvolatile. This means the data is 
retained even if there is a power failure or breakdown, since the cores store data in the form of magnetic 
charges rather than electric current. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BUBBLE-STORAGE-2-6-">BUBBLE STORAGE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">One of the latest technological developments in storage media is the introduction of bubble memory. 
Bubble memory consists of a very thin crystal made of semiconductor material. The molecules of this 
special crystal act as tiny magnets (fig. 2-5). The polarity of these molecules or "magnetic domains" can 
be switched in an opposite direction by passing a current through a control circuit imprinted on top of the 
crystal. In this manner, data can be stored by changing the polarity of the magnetic domains. Since the 
principle is the same as for magnetic core storage, bubble memory is considered nonvolatile. The data is 
retained even if there is a power failure. Furthermore, the process of reading from bubble memory is 
nondestructive, meaning that the data is still present after being read. This is not the case with core 
storage, which must be regenerated after being read. If we were to view these magnetic domains under a 
microscope, they would look like tiny bubbles; hence the name, bubble memory. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Up to this point, you have learned some of the general functions of the cpu, the physical 
characteristics of memory, and how data is stored in the internal storage section. Now, we will explain yet 
another way to classify internal (primary or main) storage. This is by the different kinds of memories used 
within the cpu: read-only memory, random-access memory, programmable read-only memory, and 
erasable programmable read-only memory. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">READ-ONLY MEMORY (ROM) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In most computers, it is useful to have often used instructions, such as those used to bootstrap (initial 
system load) the computer or other specialized programs, permanently stored inside the computer. 
Memory that enables us to do this without the programs and data being lost (even when the computer is 
powered down) is called read-only memory. Only the computer manufacturer can provide these programs 
in ROM and once done, they cannot be changed. Consequently, you cannot put any of your own data or 
programs in ROM. Many complex functions such as routines to extract square roots, translators for 
programming languages, and operating systems can be placed in ROM memory. Since these instructions 
are hard wired (permanent), they can be performed quickly and accurately. Another advantage of ROM is </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">that your computer facility can order programs tailored for its needs and have them permanently installed 
in ROM by the manufacturer. Such programs are called microprograms or firmware. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">RANDOM-ACCESS MEMORY (RAM) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Another kind of memory used inside computers is called random-access memory (RAM) or 
read/write memory. RAM memory is rather like a blackboard on which you can scribble down notes, read 
them, and rub them out when you are finished with them. In the computer, RAM is the working memory. 
Data can be read (retrieved) from or written (stored) into RAM just by giving the computer the address of 
the location where the data is stored or is to be stored. When the data is no longer needed, you can simply 
write over it. This allows you to use the storage again for something else. Core, semiconductor, and 
bubble storage all have random access capabilities. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">PROGRAMMABLE READ-ONLY MEMORY (PROM) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">An alternative to ROM is programmable read only memory (PROM) that can be purchased already 
programmed by the manufacturer or in a blank state. By using a blank PROM, you can enter any program 
into the memory. However, once the PROM has been written into, it can never be altered or changed. 
Thus you have the advantage of ROM with the additional flexibility to program the memory to meet a 
unique need. The main disadvantage of PROM is that if a mistake is made and entered into PROM, it 
cannot be corrected or erased. Also, a special device is needed to "burn" the program into PROM. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">ERASABLE PROGRAMMABLE READ-ONLY MEMORY (EPROM) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) was developed to overcome the drawback 
of PROM. EPROMs can also be purchased blank from the manufacturer and programmed locally at your 
command/activity. Again, this requires special equipment. The big difference with EPROM is that it can 
be erased if and when the need arises. Data and programs can be retrieved over and over again without 
destroying the contents of the EPROM. They will stay there quite safely until you want to reprogram it by 
first erasing the EPROM with a burst of ultra-violet light. This is to your advantage, because if a mistake 
is made while programming the EPROM, it is not considered fatal. The EPROM can be erased and 
corrected. Also, it allows you the flexibility to change programs to include improvements or 
modifications in the future.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SECONDARY-STORAGE-2-9-">SECONDARY STORAGE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The last kind of memory we will briefly introduce here is called secondary storage or auxiliary 
storage. This is memory outside the main body of the computer (cpu) where we store programs and data 
for future use. When the computer is ready to use these programs and data, they are read into internal 
storage. Secondary (auxiliary) storage media extends the storage capabilities of the computer system. We 
need it for two reasons. First, because the computer's internal storage is limited in size, it cannot always 
hold all the data we need. Second, in secondary storage, data and programs do not disappear when power 
is turned off. Secondary storage is nonvolatile. This means information is lost only if you, the user, 
intentionally erase it. The three types of secondary storage we most commonly use are magnetic disk, 
tape, and drum. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MAGNETIC-DISK-2-9-">MAGNETIC DISK 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The popularity of disk storage devices is largely because of their direct-access capabilities. Most 
every system (micro, mini, and mainframe) will have disk capability. Magnetic disks resemble 
phonograph records (round platters), coated with a magnetizable recording material (iron oxide), but their 
similarities end there. Magnetic disks come in many different sizes and storage capacities. They range 
from 3 inches to 4 feet in diameter and can store from 2.5 million to 600 million characters (bytes) of 
data. They can be portable in that they are removable, or they can be permanently mounted in the storage 
devices called disk drive units or disk drives. They can be made of rigid metal (hard disks) or flexible 
plastic (floppy disks or diskettes) as shown in figure 2-6. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Music is stored on a phonograph record in a continuous groove that spirals into the center of the 
record. But there are no grooves on a magnetic disk. Instead, data is stored on all disks in a number of 
invisible concentric circles called tracks. Each track has a designated number beginning with track 000 at 
the outer edge of the disk. The numbering continues sequentially toward the center to track 199, 800, or 
whatever the highest track number is. No track ever touches another (fig. 2-7). The number of tracks can 
vary from 35 to 77 on a floppy disk surface and from 200 to over 800 on hard disk surfaces. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Data is written as tiny magnetic bits (or spots) on the disk surface. Eight-bit codes are generally used 
to represent data. Each code represents a different number, letter, or special character. In chapter 4, you'll 
learn how the codes are formed. When data is read from the disk, the data on the disk remains unchanged. 
When data is written on the disk, it replaces any data previously stored on the same area of the disk. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Characters are stored on a single track as strings of magnetized bits (0's and 1's) as shown in figure 
2-8. The 1 bits indicate magnetized spots or ON bits. The 0 bits represent unmagnetized portions of the 
track or OFF bits. Although the tracks get smaller as they get closer to the center of the disk platter, each 
track can hold the same amount of data because the data density is greater on tracks near the center. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A track can hold one or more records. A record is a set of related data treated as a unit. The records 
on a track are separated by gaps in which no data is recorded, and each of the records is preceded by a 
disk address. This address indicates the unique position of the record on the track and is used to directly 
access the record. Figure 2-9 shows a track on which five records have been recorded. Because of the 
gaps and addresses, the amount of data we can store on a track is reduced as the number of records per 
track is increased. Records on disk can be blocked (grouped together). Only one disk address is needed </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">per block, and as a result, fewer gaps occur. We can use the blocking technique to increase the amount of 
data we can store on one track. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The storage capacity of a disk depends on the bits per inch of track and the tracks per inch of surface. 
Using Winchester technology, the designers of disk drive units were able to increase the data density of a 
disk by increasing the number of tracks. Winchester was the code name used by IBM during the 
development of this technology. The designers originally planned to use dual disk drives to introduce the 
new concept. Each drive was to have a storage capacity of 30 million characters, and thus was expected to 
be a "30-30." Since that was the caliber of a famous rifle, the new product was nicknamed "Winchester." 
The designers found that data density could be improved and storage capacity increased by reducing the 
flying height, the distance of the read/write heads over the disk surfaces when reading and writing. By 
doing this, smaller magnetized spots could be precisely written and then read. The read/write heads were 
moved so close to the disk that a human hair looked like a mountain in the path of the flying head. 
Winchester technology reduces this potential problem by sealing the disks in a contamination-free 
container. This eliminates foreign objects from coming in contact with the read/write heads. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Data can be physically organized in one of two ways on a disk pack, depending on the manufacturer 
and the model of disk drive you are using. One way uses the cylinder method, and the other uses the 
sector method. On diskettes, data is organized using the sector method. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The cylinder method uses a cylinder as the basic reference point. When you look at figure 2-10, view 
A, you will see a disk pack containing six disk platters with 10 recording surfaces. Imagine you are 
looking down through the disk pack from the top. All the tracks with the same number line up vertically. 
Together they are called a cylinder. These 10 tracks, one on each recording surface, can be referenced by 
the 10 read/write heads on the five access arms at each discrete location where the access arms can be 
positioned. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, to physically reference a record stored using the cylinder method, a computer program 
must specify the cylinder number, the recording surface number, and the record number as shown in 
figure 2-10, view A. Here, the record is stored in cylinder 25 of recording surface 6 and is the first record 
on that track. Special data stored on each track specifies the beginning of the track so that the first record, 
second record, third record, and so on, can be identified. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another way to physically organize data on the disk pack (and on diskettes) is to use the sector 
method. This requires that each of the tracks be divided into individual storage areas called sectors 
(shown in figure 2-10, view B). The number of sectors varies with the disk system used; however, there 
are usually eight or more. Each sector holds a specific number of characters. Before a record can be 
accessed, a computer program must again give the disk drive the record's address specifying the track 
number, the surface number, and the sector number of the record. One or more read/write heads are then 
moved to the proper track, the head over the specified surface is activated, and the data is read from or 
written to the designated sector as it spins under the head.

tape recorders. It is used mainly for secondary storage. It differs from commercial tape in that it is usually 
wider (ranging from one-half inch to an inch), and it is manufactured to more rigid quality specifications. 
It is made of a MYLAR® base coated with a magnetic oxide that can be magnetized to store data. 
Magnetic tape comes in a variety of lengths (from 600 to 3,000 feet), and is packaged in one of three 
ways: open reel, cartridge, or cassette, as shown in figure 2-11. Large computers use standard open reels, 
1/2-inch wide tape, 2,400 feet in length. Magnetic tape units are categorized by the type of packaging 
used for the tape. The tape unit (or drive) shown in figure 2-12 uses open reels, while cartridge tape units 
use tape cartridges and cassette units use tape cassettes. Cartridge tape units are often used on personal 
computers to provide backup for hard disk.

Regardless of which term is used, a frame or byte is a group of related bits that make up a single character 
written across the width of the tape. Most magnetic tape units are capable of reading and writing in 
several different densities. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Magnetic tapes have many common features and data recording formats. Each tape is physically 
marked in some manner to indicate where reading and writing on tape is to begin (known as the 
beginning-of-tape [BOT]), and where it ends (known as the end-of-tape [EOT]). The length of tape 
between the BOT and EOT is referred to as the usable recording (reading/writing) surface or usable 
storage area. BOT/EOT markers are usually made of short silver strips of reflective tape (1/4-inch wide 
by 1/2-inch long) as shown in figure 2-14. The BOT marker is normally placed toward the front edge of 
the tape (the side nearest you when the tape is mounted on the tape unit). The EOT marker is placed 
toward the back edge (the side farthest from you when the tape is mounted on the tape unit). They are 
placed approximately 15 to 20 feet in from each end on the shiny side of the tape. Sometimes, holes or 
clear plastic inserts are used as markers in place of reflective strips. Regardless of the method used, the 
BOT/EOT markers are sensed by an arrangement of lamps and/or photodiode sensors to indicate where 
reading and writing is to begin and end. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">We can make records on magnetic tape any size we need to hold the data. We are restricted only by 
the length of the tape or the capacity of internal storage. For example, a record can be one character, 
several characters, or thousands of characters in length. The collection of records is called a file. A file 
containing payroll records is called a payroll file; a file containing supply inventory records is called a 
supply inventory file. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Records can be placed on tape either separately as single records (unblocked) as shown in figure 
2-15, view A, or multiple records can be grouped together (blocked) as shown in figure 2-15, view B, to 
form a record block. The number of records stored in a record block is the blocking factor. In this

</p><p class="paragraph">All magnetic tape must be moving at a predetermined speed for data to be read from or written on 
the tape. Data cannot be read or written while the tape is coming up to speed, slowing down, or stopped. 
During this time delay, the tape moves a short distance creating a blank spot on the tape. This interrecord 
gap or interblock gap separates each single record or block of records on the tape. The length of the gap 
varies, depending upon the particular system and method of recording, but is approximately 2/5 to 3/4 
inch in length. If single records are stored on the tape, the interrecord gap may be longer than the portion 
of tape used to store the record. Therefore, much of the tape's recording surface is wasted. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To overcome the inefficiency of storing single data records, we normally block records. In figure 
2-15, view B, you will notice the tape is used more efficiently than the tape in figure 2-15, view A. 
Blocking allows more data to be stored on a reel of tape. 
</p><p class="paragraph">During reading, the record begins with the first character sensed following an interrecord or 
interblock gap and continues until the next gap is reached. All input records read are internally stored in 
accordance with the amount of storage area set aside by the applications program. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Magnetic tape, as a storage media, offers several useful features. We can store large amounts of data 
in a variety of convenient package sizes (open reels, cartridges, or cassettes). Magnetic tapes are easily 
interchangeable between similar tape units of different computer systems, and tapes are less prone to 
damage than other types of storage media.

</p><p class="paragraph">A magnetic drum differs from a magnetic disk in that the tracks in which the data is stored are 
assigned to channels located around the circumference of the drum as shown in figure 2-16. That is, the 
channels form circular bands around the drum. The coded representation of data in figure 2-16 is similar 
to that used on 9-track magnetic tape, 8-bit code. The basic functions of the read/write heads are to place 
magnetized spots (those little binary 0's and 1's) on the drum during a writing operation and to sense these 
spots during a reading operation. The read/write heads of a drum perform in a manner similar to the 
read/write heads of a magnetic tape unit or disk drive unit. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The tracks on each channel are grouped into sectors as illustrated in figure 2-16. Does this sound 
familiar to you? It sounds almost like the format used on disk packs when referring to tracks (or 
cylinders) and sectors. As the drum rotates, the reading or writing occurs when the specified sector of a 
given channel passes under the read/write head for that channel. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Some drums are mounted in a horizontal position, such as the one shown in figure 2-16, while others 
are mounted in a vertical position. Another major difference in the design is the number of read/write 
heads. Some drums use only one read/write head, which services all channels on the drum. In this case, 
the head moves back and forth (or up and down) over the surface of the drum as required. Other drums, 
using multiple read/write heads, have one principal advantage over drums with the single-head type. 
Since one read/write head is assigned to each channel, no read/write head movement is required. That is, 
the time required for head positioning is zero. The only significant time required when reading or writing 
is the rotational delay that occurs in reaching a desired record location.

</p><h3 class="subsection">INPUT/OUTPUT DEVICES (EXTERNAL) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Input and output devices are similar in operation but perform opposite functions. It is through the use 
of these devices that the computer is able to communicate with the outside world. Input data may be in 
any one of three forms: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Manual inputs from a keyboard or console 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Analog inputs from instruments or sensors 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Inputs from a source on or in which data has previously been stored in a form intelligible to the 
computer 
</p><p class="paragraph">Computers can process hundreds of thousands of computer words or characters per second. Thus, a 
study of the first method (manual input) reflects the inability of human-operated keyboards or keypunches 
to supply data at a speed that matches the speed of digital computers. A high average speed for keyboard 
operation is two or three characters per second, that, when coded to form computer words, would reduce 
the data input rate to the computer to less than a computer word per second. Since mainframe computers 
are capable of reading several thousand times this amount of information per second, it is clear that 
manual inputs should be minimized to make more efficient use of computer time. However, as a rule, the 
keyboard is the normal input media for microcomputers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Input data that has previously been recorded on paper tapes, magnetic tapes, magnetic disks, or 
floppy disks in a form understood by the program may also be entered into the computer. These are much 
faster methods than entering data manually from a keyboard. The most commonly used input devices in 
this category are magnetic tape units, magnetic disk drive units, and floppy disk drive units. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Output information is also made available in three forms: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Displayed information: codes, numbers, words, or symbols presented on a display device like a 
cathode-ray screen </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">MAGNETIC TAPE UNITS (INPUT/OUTPUT) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The purpose of any magnetic tape unit (drive or device) is to write data on or read data from a 
magnetic tape (fig. 2-17). Tape stores data in a sequential manner. In sequential processing, the computer 
must begin searching at the beginning and check each record until the desired data is found. Like a tape 
cassette with recorded music, to play the fifth song recorded, you must play or fast forward the tape past 
the first four songs before you can play the fifth. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Two reels are used, tape moves from a supply reel to a take-up reel (both are mounted on hubs). 
Figure 2-18 shows the basic tape drive mechanism. The magnetic oxide coated side of the tape passes 
directly over the read/write head assembly, making contact with the heads. The magnetic tape unit reads 
and writes data in parallel channels or tracks along the length of the tape as shown in figure 2-19, view A. 
Each channel or track is used by a read/write head (one for each channel), as the tape moves across the 
magnetic gap of the head. Read/write heads may be either one gap or two gap as shown in figure 2-19, 
views B and C. The one-gap head has only one magnetic gap at which both reading and writing occur. 
The two-gap head has one gap for reading and another for writing. Although the one gap is satisfactory, 
the two-gap head gives increased speed by checking while writing. For example, a tape being written on 
passes over the write gap where the data is recorded, and then the data is read as it passes over the read 
gap to make a comparison. With this method, errors are detected almost instantly. When you look closely 
at figure 2-19, view B (top view), you will notice that there is one read/write coil in the write head for 
each channel (or track). In this particular case, there are seven. It is the electrical current flowing through 
these coils that magnetizes the iron-oxide coating on the surface of the tape. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The major differences between magnetic tape units are the speed at which the tape is moved past the 
read/write head and the density of the recorded information. You know that density describes the number 
of binary digits, bytes, or frames we can record on an inch of tape. The most common tape densities are 
800 and 1,600 BPI (or FPI). Tape speed (or tape movement) varies to a great extent, from less than 50 
inches per second to more than 100 inches per second. How fast a tape unit reads and writes is specified 
as the character transfer rate which is calculated by multiplying the speed of the magnetic tape unit by the 
character density. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">MAGNETIC DISK DRIVE UNITS (INPUT/OUTPUT) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Magnetic disk drive units are storage devices that read and write information on the magnetized 
surfaces of rotating disks (fig. 2-20). The disks are made of thin metal, coated on each side so that data 
can be recorded in the form of magnetized spots. As the disks spin around like music records, characters 
can be stored on them or retrieved in a direct manner. This direct accessing of data has a big advantage 
over the sequential accessing of data. It gives us fast, immediate access to specific data without having to 
examine each and every record from the beginning. You can direct the disk drive to begin reading at any 
point. This is like the phonograph record, you can place the needle at any point and begin playing at any 
point. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Located within each disk drive unit is a drive motor that rotates the disk at a constant speed, 
normally 3,600 revolutions per minute (rpm); or, if you prefer, 60 revolutions per second. The rotational 
speed for floppy disks is usually between 300 and 400 rpm because of their plastic base. Data is written 
on the tracks of a spinning disk surface and read from the surface by one or more (multiple) read/write 
heads. When reading from and writing to hard disks (rigid disks), the read/write heads float on a cushion 
of air and do not actually touch the surface of the disk. The distance between the head and the surface 
varies from a millionth of an inch to one-half millionth of an inch. This distance is called the flying 
height. When multiple disks (platters) are packaged together as a unit in a disk pack, a number of access 
arms and read/write heads are used to access both surfaces of each platter (fig. 2-21). The disk pack 
shown consists of six metal disks mounted on a central spindle. Data can be recorded on all surfaces 
except the top surface of the top disk, and the bottom surface of the bottom disk. These two surfaces are 
intentionally left blank for protection. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

with personal (desktop) computers (fig. 2-22). The unit consists of a disk drive in which the disk rotates 
and a controller containing the electronic circuitry that feeds signals onto and from the disk. The disk 
(diskette) is a thin, flexible platter (floppy disk) coated with magnetic material so characters can be 
recorded on the surface in the form of magnetized spots. Floppy disks come in several sizes from 3 to 8 
inches in diameter. The most common are the 8-inch disk, the 5 1/4-inch disk, and the 3 1/2-inch disk. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

drawings. Printers range from electronic typewriters to high-speed printers. High-speed printers are 
usually used on mainframes and minis to prepare supply requisitions, pay checks, inventory, or financial 
reports at 10 lines per second and faster. The types of printers we'll discuss are daisy-wheel, dot matrix,

</h3><p class="paragraph">Daisy-wheel printers have the most professional-looking, pleasing-to-the-eye print of all the printers 
in the character-at-a-time impact printer class. Daisy-wheel printers are often used in an office or word 
processing environment, where crisp, sharp, high-quality (letter quality) characters are a must. The daisy-
wheel printer uses a round disk, with embossed characters located at the end of each petal-like projection 
(one character per petal), similar to the petals of a daisy, as shown in figure 2-24. A drive motor spins the 
wheel at a high rate of speed. When the desired character spins to the correct position, the print hammer 
strikes that character causing it to be printed on the paper. Once printed, the daisy wheel continues to 
move, searching out the next character to be printed, until the line is completed. The speeds of daisy-
wheel printers range from 30 to 60 characters per second (cps). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Dot-Matrix Printers 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Dot-matrix printers, (also known as the wire matrix printers) create characters in much the same way 
you see numbers on the scoreboard at a baseball or football game. In contrast to the daisy-wheel printers, 
dot-matrix printers use an arrangement of tiny pins or hammers, called a dot matrix, to generate characters 
a dot-at-a-time. A dot-matrix print head builds characters out of the dots created by the pins in the matrix. 
Figure 2-25, view A, shows what dot matrix characters look like when printed. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The dot matrix is defined in terms of rows and columns of dots. A 5 by 7 matrix uses up to five 
vertical columns of seven dots to create a character. An example of a 5 by 7 matrix printing the letter H is 
shown in figure 2-25, view D. The size of dot matrixes varies from a 5 by 7 matrix to as large as a 58 by 
18 matrix. A number of dot-matrix printers use a single vertical column of pins to print characters, as 
shown in figure 2-25, view B. The characters are printed by moving (stepping) the print head a small 
amount and printing the vertical columns one at a time until the character is printed as shown in figure 
2-25, views C and D. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The size of the matrix determines the quality of the printed character. In other words, the more dots 
used to print a character, the better the character is filled in and the higher its print quality. Dot-matrix 
printers are faster than the daisy-wheel printers with speeds ranging from 60 to 350 cps, but their print 
quality is not as good. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Ink Jet Printers 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Ink jet printers employ a technique very similar to the way we use a can of spray paint and a stencil. 
A spray of electrically charged ink is shot (under pressure) toward the paper. Before reaching the paper, 
the ink is passed through an electrical field which forms the letters in a matrix form. The print resulting 
from this process consists of easy to read, high-quality characters. Some manufacturers use large droplets 
of ink for faster printing, while others use small droplets for better clarity but with slightly reduced 
printing speeds. These printers can print up to 300 cps (characters per second). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Laser Printers 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Laser printers direct a beam of light through a rotating disk containing the full range of print 
characters. The appropriate character image is directed onto photographic paper, which is then put 
through a toner, developed, and used to make additional copies. The print resulting from this process 
consists of sharp, clean images that are easy on the eyes. These printers can print up to 20,000 plus lines 
per minute, or 26,666 cps (characters per second). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">KEYBOARDS (INPUT) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A keyboard is nothing more than an array of switches called keyswitches. Keyboards are designed to 
input a code to the computer when a keyswitch is depressed. Each keyswitch, or key, on the keyboard is 
assigned a particular code value; and it is usually imprinted with a legend to identify its function. Figure 
2-26 shows a keyboard combined with a crt on a microcomputer. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The primary purpose of a keyboard is to enter or input alphanumeric (numbers, letters, and special 
characters) character codes. The major grouping of keyswitches on a keyboard will be in one of the two 
styles of a typewriter keyboard arrangement (QWERTY or DVORAK). The typewriter keyswitches are 
arranged in 4 rows of 10 or more switches. The keyboard arrangement shown in figure 2-27 is QWERTY. 
The rows are usually offset to the row above to make it easier to reach all the keys when typing. The tops 
of the individual keyswitches are sculptured to conform to the shape of the human finger. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

keypads, special function switches (F1-F12), and cursor control keys. The special function switches allow 
an operator to use the special functions designed in the software. For example, in a word processing 
program, you can use them to spell check a document, search for a particular portion of text, move text 
from one place to another, and to print hard copies of a document. These are but a few of the functions 
allowed; however, as you become more familiar with computers you will learn them all. The cursor 
control key allows you to move to different locations on the screen. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The design of keyboards varies from device to device and is dependent on the requirements of the 
system in which the keyboards are installed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Keyboards are generally used with nontactical computer systems. However, the newer tactical 
display system consoles have optional keyboards for data entry. A keyboard may be built into the display 
device, or it may be a separate component connected only by a communication cable. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DISPLAY-DEVICES-2-28-">DISPLAY DEVICES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Display devices are the crts and other displays that are part of computer terminals, computer

information (alphanumerics or graphic symbology). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The information displayed on a display device screen is not permanent. That is where the term soft-
copy comes from. The information is available for viewing only as long as it is on the display screen.

</p><p class="paragraph">The raster is a series of horizontal lines crossing the face of the crt screen (fig. 2-28). Each horizontal 
line is made up of one trace of the electron beam from left to right. The raster starts at the top left corner 
of the crt screen. As each horizontal line is completed, the blanked electron beam is rapidly returned or 
retraced to the left of the screen. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Vertical deflection moves the beam down, and the horizontal sweep repeats. When the vertical 
sweep reaches the bottom line of the raster, a vertical blanked retrace returns the sweep to the starting 
position of the raster, and the process is repeated. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each completed raster scan is referred to as a field; two fields make up a frame. The display rate of 
fields and frames determines the amount of flicker in the display that is perceived by the human eye. Each 
field is made up of approximately 525 horizontal lines. The actual number of horizontal lines varies from 
device to device. A frame consists of the interlaced lines of two fields. The horizontal lines of the two 
fields are interlaced to smooth out the display. A display rate of 30 frames per second produces a smooth, 
flicker-free raster and corresponding display on the screen. 
</p><p class="paragraph">PICTURE ELEMENTS.—The actual display of data results from the use of picture elements. A 
picture element is a variable dot of light derived from video signals input to the display monitor. The 
picture elements, often called pixels or pels, are contained in the horizontal scan lines crossing the face of 
the crt screen. The horizontal and vertical sweeps are continuous and repetitive in nature. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Pictures with alphanumeric characters and graphics can be created and displayed by varying the 
intensity or brightness of the picture element dots. This is done in conjunction with the phosphor coating 
on the face of the crt. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The number of picture elements in each horizontal line varies from device to device. The actual 
number of picture elements is dependent on the frequency bandwidth of the video monitor, the number of 
characters to be displayed on a line, and the physical size of the screen. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">2-30 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each picture element is addressable by a row and column address. Picture elements are numbered 
from left to right on each horizontal line (column number). Each horizontal line has a row number. 
Picture elements, at a minimum, will have off (blanked) or on (full intensity) states. Many display devices 
have the capability to display picture elements at varying degrees of intensity for the display of graphics. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Characters are assembled on the screen in much the same way as a dot-matrix print head prints a 
character. It takes several horizontal lines and picture elements on each line to create a character. Figure 
2-29 shows the generation of the character A, 7 picture elements wide and 9 horizontal lines high. The 
character is built using what is, in effect, a 7 by 9 dot matrix. The picture elements used to build the 
character would be at full intensity; the remaining picture elements in the matrix would be blanked. If 
dark characters on a lighted screen were desired, then the character picture elements would be blanked 
and the remainder displayed at full intensity. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Approximately 640 picture elements per horizontal line are required for the display of an 80 
character line. Therefore, you can expect 140,000 picture elements on a raster scan display screen (80 
alphanumeric characters per line and 25 lines). 
</p><p class="paragraph">HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL RESOLUTION.—Horizontal resolution is defined in terms of 
the number of picture elements that can be displayed on the horizontal line without overlapping or 
running into each other. It is often stated in terms of lines of resolution. In other words, a monitor with a 
horizontal resolution of 1,000 lines can display 1,000 vertical lines using 1,000 picture elements per line. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Vertical resolution depends on the number of horizontal scan lines used by the particular display 
raster. Generally, the greater the number of scan lines, the easier it is to resolve a horizontal line of 
display. This characteristic remains true up to a point, called the merge point, where the variation between 
the lines cannot be detected by the human eye. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DISPLAYING DATA ON RASTER SCAN SCREENS.—Raster scan displays are repetitive in 
nature. The raster frame is displayed approximately 30 times a second. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic video monitor does nothing more than display the video signals it receives. If no video 
signals are received, then all the picture elements remain blanked, and the screen is blank in each frame. 
For data to be displayed accurately, each and every frame must blank and unblank the same picture 
elements. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The digital logic that drives video monitors is designed to take advantage of the repetitive nature of 
frames. There can only be a fixed number of picture elements on the screen of a display; therefore, the 
contents of the display screen are organized into a data unit called a page. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The page contains the status of every picture element on the display screen. The page is usually 
stored in some form of random-access memory, RAM chips being the most common. The contents of 
page memory, or, as it is sometimes called, video memory, are continually scanned by the video 
generation logic and used to develop the video signals for the picture element display. The picture 
element locations in page memory are read in time to develop the video signals for the picture element 
display on the horizontal lines. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the display is to be changed, the contents of page memory must be changed. The display on the 
screen changes as new data is stored in page memory. Two addressing methods are used with page 
memory. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Unformatted Displays.—Displays that reference page memory by picture element address are 
called unformatted or fully populated displays. These displays are more commonly used for graphics 
rather than alphanumeric characters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Formatted Displays.—Often displays are organized by character position and line number. These 
displays are known as formatted displays. This display method is used with devices displaying 
alphanumeric characters only or those with an alternate graphic capability. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The video generation logic of these types of displays scans the entire page memory, as before, to 
generate the display picture elements. The difference is in the way the new data is written into the page 
memory. Individual picture element addresses are not used. Character addresses are used to reference 
page memory. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The screen is organized into character lines. Each line is made up of a fixed number of character 
positions or columns. A fixed number of character lines can be displayed. A common arrangement found 
on display screens is twenty five 80-character lines, or 2,000 characters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The character set that can be displayed on a device's formatted screen is stored in ROMs or PROMS. 
That is, the dot-matrix (picture element) patterns for each individual character to be displayed are stored. 
Different character sets may be displayed by simply replacing the appropriate ROM or PROM chips with 
new chips containing different character patterns. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Upon receipt of a character code and a row and column address, the device logic reads the picture 
element pattern (dot matrix) from the ROM and writes the pattern into the appropriate character position 
in the page memory. The desired character is then displayed at the correct position. Other display devices 
store the codes in page memory and convert the codes to picture element dots when scanning memory to 
refresh or redisplay the characters on the screen. The use of formatted displays greatly simplifies the 
programming requirements for the display of alphanumeric data. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Flat Panel Displays 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A number of display methods are in use that are designed to reduce the depth of the crt display 
caused by the length of the tube. These devices are collectively known as flat panel displays. Three types 
of flat panel displays commonly in use with computer systems are liquid crystal displays (LCDs), gas 
plasma displays (GPDs), and electroluminescent displays (ELDs). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The screens of these flat panel displays are made up of pairs of electrodes. Each pair of electrodes is 
used to generate one picture element. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">2-32 
</p><p class="paragraph">The liquid crystal display differs from the gas plasma and electroluminescent displays in that it does 
not generate its own light for the picture elements. The LCD requires an external light source, often called 
a backlight, for computer applications. The liquid crystal material between the charged electrodes 
becomes translucent when voltage is applied and allows the backlight to shine through as a picture 
element. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the gas plasma and electroluminescent displays, the picture element light is generated by ionizing 
a gas (neon or neon argon) between the charged electrodes (gas plasma display) or by stimulating a 
luminescent material in the same manner (electroluminescent display). In either case, the picture element 
only emits light when the electrodes have voltage applied to them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the advantages of flat panel displays is that smaller voltages are required for their operation 
than for a crt. Gas plasma displays use approximately 200 volts to charge the electrodes, and 
electroluminescent displays require only 20 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The picture elements in these displays are addressed by the row and column method. Displays with 
as many as 737,280 picture elements (960 rows by 768 columns) have been developed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The picture elements on flat panel displays are not lighted continually. This would require a large 
amount of power and generate excessive heat. A sequential scan similar to a crt raster is used. Once again 
a page memory is required. The picture element electrodes are on and off as the scan sequentially 
addresses page memory. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Those picture elements that are to display a dot are momentarily turned on and off starting with the 
first picture element in the top row, or line, and ending with the last picture element on the bottom row. 
The picture elements are turned on and off at a high enough frequency that the human eye cannot detect 
the flicker of the off-on-off cycle. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The sequential scan used to light the picture elements is continuous and repetitive. Once again, the 
page memory must be changed to change the display. Flat panel displays may be formatted or 
unformatted in the same manner as crt displays.

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY 
</h1><p class="paragraph">Now that you have finished chapter 2, you should be feeling more at ease with digital computers. 
You should realize by now that they are not so hard to understand, once you have the terminology down. 
The information that follows summarizes the important points of this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT is the brain of the computer. We generally refer to it as the 
cpu or mainframe. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The CONTROL SECTION directs the flow of traffic (operations) and data, and maintains order 
within the computer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ARITHMETIC-LOGIC SECTION performs all arithmetic operations-adding, subtracting, 
multiplying, and dividing. It also tests various conditions during processing and takes action based on the 
result. 
</p><p class="paragraph">INTERNAL STORAGE is sometimes referred to as primary storage, main storage, or main 
memory (because its functions are similar to our own human memory). It stores the programs and data. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC CORE STORAGE is made up of tiny doughnut-shaped rings made of ferrite (iron) 
that are strung on a grid of very thin wires. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SEMICONDUCTOR STORAGE consists of hundreds of thousands of tiny electronic circuits 
etched on a silicon chip. 
</p><p class="paragraph">BUBBLE STORAGE is made of semiconductor material in the form of a very thin crystal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">READ-ONLY MEMORY (ROM) allows us to permanently store programs that will not be lost 
even when the computer is powered down. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RANDOM-ACCESS MEMORY (RAM) is read/ write memory. It is the working memory, rather 
like a blackboard, that you can scribble down notes, read them, and rub them out when you are finished 
with them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SECONDARY STORAGE is the memory outside the main body of the computer (cpu) where we 
store programs and data for future use. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC TAPE is a sequential access storage device. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC DISK is a direct access storage device. 
</p><p class="paragraph">INPUT/OUTPUT DEVICES are the means by which the computer communicates with the outside 
world. These include magnetic tape units, magnetic disk drive units, floppy disk drive units, printers 
(daisy-wheel, dot-matrix, ink jet, and laser), and display devices (raster scan crt and flat panel). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Up to now we have been discussing computer OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS and HARDWARE (the 
computer and its peripheral devices), and how these devices work and communicate with each other. 
What about this thing called SOFTWARE? Do we really need it? We most certainly do! Software plays a 
major role in computer data processing. For example, without software, the computer could not perform 
simple addition. It's the software that makes everything happen. Or putting it another way, software 
brings the computer to life. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You already know it takes a program to make the computer function. You load an operating system 
into the computer to manage the computer's resources and operations. You give job information to the 
operating system to tell it what you want the computer to do. You may tell it to assemble or compile a 
COBOL program. You may tell it to run the payroll or print inventory reports. You may tell it to copy a 
tape using a utility program. You may tell it to print the data from a disk file, also using a utility program. 
You may tell it to test a program. This job information may be entered through the console or read into 
the computer from tape or disk. It also may be entered by the programmer or user from a remote computer 
terminal. The operating system receives and processes the job information and executes the programs 
according to that job information. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Software can be defined as all the stored programs and routines (operating aids) needed to fully use 
the capabilities of a computer. Generally speaking, we say, "If it is not hardware then it must be 
software."

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OPERATING-SYSTEMS-3-1-">OPERATING SYSTEMS

Basically, operating systems are designed to provide the operator with the most efficient way of executing 
many user programs. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">An operating system is a collection of many programs used by the computer to manage its own 
resources and operations. These programs control the execution of other programs. They schedule, assign 
resources, monitor, and control the work of the computer. There are several types. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TYPES-OF-OPERATING-SYSTEMS-3-2-">TYPES OF OPERATING SYSTEMS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Operating systems are designed to provide various operating modes. Some systems can only do one 
task at a time, while others can perform several at a time. Some systems allow only one person to use the 
system, and others allow multiple users. Single user/single tasking operating systems are the simplest and 
most common on microcomputers. CP/M®-801, CP/M-86®1, and MS-DOS®2 are examples. Single 
user/multitasking operating systems allow you to do more than one task as long as the tasks don't use the 
same type of resources. For example, you can print one job while you run another, as long as the second 
job does not require the printer. Examples are Concurrent CP/M® -86 3, Concurrent® DOS 3, and MS-
DOS®; (3.0 and above). Multiuser/multitasking operating systems let more than one user access the same 
resources at the same time. This is especially useful for sharing common data. These are only feasible on 
processors (the functional unit in a computer that interprets and executes instructions) of 16 bits or more 
and with large memories. UNIX 4 is an example. There are also multiprocessor systems, shared resource 
systems. This means each user (or operator) has a dedicated microprocessor (cpu), which shares common 
resources (disks, printers, etc.).

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMPATIBILITY-WITH-APPLICATIONS-SOFTWARE-3-2-">COMPATIBILITY WITH APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">To use an applications program, it must be compatible with the operating system. Therefore, the 
availability of application software for a particular operating system is critical. Because of this, several 
operating systems have become the most popular. For 8-bit microcomputers, CP/M (Control Program for 
Microprocessors) is widely used because many hardware manufacturers have adopted it. MS-DOS 
(MicroSoft Disk Operating System) designed from CP/M dominates in lower performance 16-bit systems. 
UNIX, an operating system for larger computers, is being used on the more powerful 16-bit and 32-bit 
microcomputers. Other operating systems are offered by microcomputer manufacturers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To overcome the applications software compatibility problem, some software comes in several 
versions so it can be run under several different operating systems. The point to remember is that not all 
applications software will run on all systems. You have to check to see that compatibility exists. You 
need the right version. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OPERATING-SYSTEM-FUNCTIONS-3-2-">OPERATING SYSTEM FUNCTIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">To give you a better idea of what you can expect to see on your microcomputer display screen, we 
will show a few fundamental disk operating system commands and messages. Again, the functions of 
each operating system are about the same, but each may use a different command to do about the same 
thing. For example, try not to get confused because CP/M uses the command PIP (peripheral interchange 
program) to copy a file, while MS-DOS uses the command COPY. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember, the first thing you need to do is boot (initial program load) the system. There are many 
ways this can be done. Here is an example. When you turn on the power, a prompt may appear on the </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the RETURN key. The operating system will load from the disk. If you are using a system set up for 
automatic booting, you won't have to type the B. The system automatically loads the operating system 
when you insert the disk that contains it. Some systems will then ask for date and time. Enter these. You 
will next see a prompt, usually A&gt; (or A:). The system is ready and drive A is assigned as your primary 
drive. One thing you might want to do is to display the disk directory to see what is on the disk. To do 
this, enter DIR following the A&gt;. This will list your files.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Now that you have learned about operating systems, let's go into another type of program, utilities. 
In addition to the utility commands (like diskcopy and rename), which are built into the operating system, 
you will probably have some independent utility programs. These are standard programs that run under 
control of the operating system just like your applications programs. They are called utilities because they 
perform general types of functions that have little relationship to the content of the data. Utility programs 
eliminate the need for programmers to write new programs when all they want to do is copy, print, or sort 
a data file. Although a new program is not needed, we do have to tell the program what we want it to do. 
We do this by providing information about files, data fields, and the process to be used. For example, a 
sort program arranges data records in a specified order. You will have to tell the sort program what fields 
to sort on and whether to sort in ascending or descending sequence. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's examine two types of utility programs to give you some idea of how a utility program works. 
The first will be sort-merge and the second the report program generator (RPG). 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SORT-MERGE-PROGRAMS-3-4-">SORT-MERGE PROGRAMS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Sorting is the term given to arranging data records in a predefined sequence or order. Merging is the 
combining of two or more ordered files into one file. For example, we normally think of putting a list of 
people's names in alphabetical order arranging them in sequence by last name. We arrange those with the 
same last name in order by first name. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If we do this ourselves, we know the alphabetic sequence B comes after A, C after B, and so on, 
and it is easy to arrange the list, even if it is a time consuming job. On a computer, the sequence of 
characters is also defined. It is called the collating sequence. Every coding system has a collating 
sequence. The capability of a computer to compare two values and determine which is greater (B is 
greater than A, C is greater than B, and so on) makes sorting possible. What about numbers and special </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">characters? They are also part of the collating sequence. In EBCDIC, (EBCDIC is a computer code that is 
discussed in detail in chapter 4) special characters, such as #, $, &amp;, and *, come in front of the alphabetic 
characters, and numbers follow. When you sort records in the defined sequence, they are in ascending 
sequence. Most sort programs also allow you to sort in reverse order. This is called descending sequence. 
In EBCDIC, it is 9-0, Z-A, then special characters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To sort a data file, you must tell the sort program what data field or fields to sort on. These fields are 
called sort (or sorting) keys. In our example, the last name is the major sort key and the first name is the 
minor sort key. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Sorting is needed in many applications. For example, for mailing we need addresses in ZIP Code 
order; personnel records may be kept in service number order; and inventory records may be kept in stock 
number order. We could go on and on. Because many of our files are large, sorting is very time 
consuming, and it is one of the processes most used on computer systems. As a user, you will become 
very familiar with this process. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Sort-merge programs usually have phases. First they initialize: read the parameters, produce the 
program code for the sort, allocate the memory space, and set up other functions. The sort-merge program 
then reads in as many input data records as the memory space allocated can hold, arranges (sorts) them in 
sequence, and writes them out to an intermediate sort-work file. It continues reading input, sorting and 
writing intermediate sort-work files until all the input is processed. It then merges (combines) the ordered 
intermediate sort-work files to produce one output file in the sequence specified. The merging process can 
be accomplished with less memory than the sort process since the intermediate sort work files are all in 
the same sequence. Records from each work file can be read, the sort keys compared based on the 
collating sequence and sort parameters, and records written to the output file maintaining the specified 
sequence. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-REPORT-PROGRAM-GENERATORS-3-5-">REPORT PROGRAM GENERATORS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Report program generators (RPG) are used to generate programs to print detail and summary reports 
of data files. Figure 3-1 is an example of a printed report. RPGs were designed to save programming time. 
Rather than writing procedural steps in a language like BASIC or COBOL, the RPG programmer writes 
the printed report requirements on specially designed forms.

</p><p class="paragraph">Included in the requirements are an input file description, the report heading information lines, the 
input data record fields, the calculations to be done, and the data fields to be printed and summarized. The 
RPG program takes this information and generates a program for the specific problem. You then run that 
program with the specified input data file to produce the printed report. The input data file must be in the 
sequence in which you want the report to summarize the data. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In our example (fig. 3-1), we summarized requisitions based on unit identification codes (UIC). We 
first sorted the input data file on the field that contains the UIC. We provided specifications to the RPG 
program to tell it to accumulate totals from the detail (individual) data records until the UIC changed. We 
then told it to print the total number of requisitions and total cost for that UIC. We did not have it print 
each detail record, although we could have. The UIC is called the control field. Each time the control field 
changes, there is a control break. Each time there is a control break, the program prints the summary 
information. After all records are read and processed, it prints a summary line (TOTALS) for all UICs. 
You can also use RPGs to generate a program to update data files.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGES-3-6-">PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Programmers must use a language that can be understood by the computer. Several methods can 
achieve human-computer communication. For example, let us assume the computer only understands 
French and the programmer speaks English. The question arises: How are we to communicate with the 
computer? One approach is for the programmer to code the instructions with the help of a translating 
dictionary before giving them to the processor. This would be fine so far as the computer is concerned; 
however, it would be very awkward for the programmer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another approach is a compromise between the programmer and computer. The programmer first 
writes instructions in a code that is easier to relate to English. This code is not the computer's language; 
therefore, the computer does not understand the orders. The programmer solves this problem by giving 
the computer another program, one that enables it to translate the instruction codes into its own language. 
This translation program, for example, would be equivalent to an English-to-French dictionary, leaving 
the translating job to be done by the computer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The third and most desirable approach from an individual's standpoint is for the computer to accept 
and interpret instructions written in everyday English terms. Each of these approaches has its place in the 
evolution of programming languages and is used in computers today. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MACHINE-LANGUAGES-3-6-">MACHINE LANGUAGES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">With early computers, the programmer had to translate instructions into the machine language form 
that the computers understood. This language was a string of numbers that represented the instruction 
code and operand address(es). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to remembering dozens of code numbers for the instructions in the computer's instruction 
set, the programmer also had to keep track of the storage locations of data and instructions. This process 
was very time consuming, quite expensive, and often resulted in errors. Correcting errors or making 
modifications to these programs was a very tedious process. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SYMBOLIC-LANGUAGES-3-7-">SYMBOLIC LANGUAGES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In the early 1950s, mnemonic instruction codes and symbolic addresses were developed. This 
improved the program preparation process by substituting letter symbols (mnemonic codes) for basic 
machine language instruction codes. Each computer has mnemonic codes, although the symbols vary 
among the different makes and models of computers. The computer still uses machine language in actual 
processing, but it translates the symbolic language into machine language equivalent. Symbolic languages 
have many advantages over machine language coding. Less time is required to write a program. Detail is 
reduced. Fewer errors are made. Errors which are made are easier to find, and programs are easier to 
modify. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PROCEDURE-ORIENTED-LANGUAGES-3-7-">PROCEDURE-ORIENTED LANGUAGES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The development of mnemonic techniques and macroinstructions led to the development of 
procedure-oriented languages. Macroinstructions allow the programmer to write a single instruction that 
is equivalent to a specified sequence of machine instructions. These procedure-oriented languages are 
oriented toward a specific class of processing problems. A class of similar problems is isolated, and a 
language is developed to process these types of applications. Several languages have been designed to 
process problems of a scientific-mathematical nature and others that emphasize file processing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Procedure-oriented languages were developed to allow a programmer to work in a language that is 
close to English or mathematical notation. This improves overall efficiency and simplifies the 
communications process between the programmer and the computer. These languages have allowed us to 
be more concerned with the problems to be solved rather than with the details of computer operation. For 
example: 
</p><p class="paragraph">COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language) was developed for business applications. It uses 
statements of everyday English and is good for handling large data files. 
</p><p class="paragraph">FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator) was developed for mathematical work. It is used by engineers, 
scientists, statisticians, and others where mathematical operations are most important. 
</p><p class="paragraph">BASIC (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was designed as a teaching language to 
help beginning programmers write programs. Therefore, it is a general-purpose, introductory language 
that is fairly easy to learn and to use. With the increase in the use of microcomputers, BASIC has 
regained popularity and is available on most microcomputer systems. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Other languages gaining in popularity are PASCAL and Ada. PASCAL is being used by many 
colleges and universities to teach programming because it is fairly easy to learn; yet is a more powerful 
language than BASIC. Although PASCAL is not yet a standardized language, it is still used rather 
extensively on microcomputers. It has greater programming capabilities on small computers than are 
possible with BASIC. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Ada's development was initiated by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). Ada is a modern 
general-purpose language designed with the professional programmer in mind and has many unique 
features to aid in the implementation of large scale applications and real-time systems. Because Ada is so 
strongly supported by the DOD and other advocates, it will become an important language like those </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

considerable adjustment on the part of most programmers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The most familiar of the procedure-oriented languages are BASIC and FORTRAN for scientific or 
mathematical problems, and COBOL for file processing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Programs written in procedure-oriented languages, unlike those in symbolic languages, may be used 
with a number of different computer makes and models. This feature greatly reduces reprogramming 
expenses when changing from one computer system to another. Other advantages to procedure-oriented 
languages are (1) they are easier to learn than symbolic languages; (2) they require less time to write; (3) 
they provide better documentation; and (4) they are easier to maintain. However, there are some 
disadvantages of procedure-oriented languages. They require more space in memory, and they process 
data at a slower rate than symbolic languages.

program is to be useful in a computer, it must be broken down into specifically defined operations or 
steps. Then the instructions, along with other data necessary for performing these operations or steps, 
must be communicated to the computer in the form of a language or code that is acceptable to the

are four fundamental and discrete steps involved in solving a problem on a computer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The four steps are as follows: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. State, analyze, and define the problem.

preparation is required before you can actually start to write or code the program. The first two steps,

results. Flowcharts use different shaped symbols connected by one-way arrows to represent operations, 
data flow, equipment, and so forth. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two types of flowcharts, system (data) flowcharts and programming flowcharts. A system 
(data) flowchart defines the major phases of the processing, as well as the various data media used. It 
shows the relationship of numerous jobs that make up an entire system. In the system (data) flowchart, an

</h3><p class="paragraph">There is no "best way" to construct a flowchart. There is no way to standardize problem solution. 
Flowcharting and programming techniques are often unique and conform to the individual's own methods 
or direction of problem solution. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This section will show an example of developing a programming flowchart. It is not the intent to say 
this is the best way; rather, it is one way to do it. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">By following this text example you should grasp the idea of solving problems through flowchart 
construction. As you gain experience and familiarity with a computer system, these ideas will serve as a 
foundation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To develop a flowchart, you must first know what problem you are to solve. It is then your job to 
study the problem definition and develop a flowchart to show the logic, steps, and sequence of steps the 
computer is to execute to solve the problem. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As an example, suppose you have taken a short-term second mortgage on a new home, and you want 
to determine what your real costs will be, the amount of interest, the amount to be applied to principal, 
and the final payment at the end of the 3-year loan period. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The first step is to be sure you understand the problem completelyWhat are the inputs and the 
outputs and what steps are needed to answer the questions? Even when you are specifying a problem of 
your own, you will find we don't usually think in small, detailed sequential steps. However, that is exactly 
how a computer operates, one step after another in a specified order. Therefore, it is necessary for you to 
think the problem solution through step by step. You might clarify the problem as shown by the Problem 
Definition in figure 3-6. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">After you have this level of narrative problem definition, you are ready to develop a flowchart 
showing the logic, steps, and sequence of steps you want the computer to execute to solve the problem. A 
programming flowchart of this problem is also shown in figure 3-6. Study both the problem definition and 
the flowchart to see their relationship and content. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You now have a plan of what you want the computer to do. The next step is to code a program that 
can be translated by a computer into a set of instructions it can execute. This step is called program 
coding. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PROGRAM-CODING-3-18-">PROGRAM CODING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">It is important to remember program coding is not the first step of programming. Too often we have 
a tendency to start coding too soon. As we just discussed, a great deal of planning and preparation must 
be done before sitting down to code the computer instructions to solve a problem. For the example 
amortization problem (fig. 3-6), we have analyzed the specifications in terms of (1) the output desired; (2) 
the operations and procedures required to produce the output; and (3) the input data needed. In 
conjunction with this analysis, we have developed a programming flowchart that outlines the procedures 
for taking the input data and processing it into usable output. You are now ready to code the instructions 
that will control the computer during processing. This requires that you know a programming language. 
</p><p class="paragraph">All programming languages, FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC and so on, are composed of instructions 
that enable the computer to process a particular application, or perform a particular function. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Instructions 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The instruction is the fundamental element in program preparation. Like a sentence, an instruction 
consists of a subject and a predicate. However, the subject is usually not specifically mentioned; rather it 
is some implied part of the computer system directed to execute the command that is given. For example, 
the chief tells a sailor to "dump the trash." The sailor will interpret this instruction correctly even though 
the subject "you" is omitted. Similarly, if the computer is told to " ADD 1234," the control section may 
interpret this to mean that the arithmetic-logic section is to add the contents of address 1234 to the 
contents of the accumulator (a register in which the result of an operation is formed). 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to an implied subject, every computer instruction has an explicit predicate consisting of at 
least two parts. The first part is referred to as the command, or operation; it answers the question "what?" 
It tells the computer what operation it is to perform; i.e., read, print, input. Each machine has a limited 
number of built-in operations that it is capable of executing. An operation code is used to communicate 
the programmer's intent to the computer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The second specific part of the predicate, known as the operand, names the object of the operation. 
In general, the operand answers the question "where?" Operands may indicate the following: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. The location where data to be processed is found. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The location where the result of processing is to be stored. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. The location where the next instruction to be executed is found. (When this type of operand is not 
specified, the instructions are executed in sequence.) 
</p><p class="paragraph">The number of operands and the structure or format of the instructions vary from one computer to 
another. However, the operation always comes first in the instruction and is followed by the operand(s). 
The programmer must prepare instructions according to the format required by the language and the 
computer to be used. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Instruction Set 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The number of instructions in a computer's instruction set may range from less than 30 to more than 
100. These instructions may be classified into categories by the action they perform such as input/output 
(I/O), data movement, arithmetic, logic, and transfer of control. Input/output instructions are used to 
communicate between I/O devices and the central processor. Data movement instructions are used for 
copying data from one storage location to another and for rearranging and changing of data elements in 
some prescribed manner. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Arithmetic instructions permit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They are common 
in all digital computers. Logic instructions allow comparison between variables, or between variables and 
constants. Transfer of control instructions are of two types, conditional and unconditional. Conditional 
transfer of control instructions are used to branch or change the sequence of program control, depending 
on the outcome of the comparison. If the outcome of a comparison is true, control is transferred to a 
specific statement number. If it proves false, processing continues sequentially through the program. 
Unconditional transfer of control instructions are used to change the sequence of program control to a 
specified program statement regardless of any condition. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Coding a Program 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Regardless of the language used, there are strict rules the programmer must adhere to with regard to 
punctuation and statement structure when coding any program. Using the programming flowchart 
introduced earlier, we have now added a program coded in BASIC to show the relationship of the 
flowchart to the actual coded instructions (fig. 3-7). Don't worry about complete understanding, just look 
at the instructions with the flowchart to get an idea of what coded instructions look like. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">You will have to have specific information about the computer you are to use. It will tell you how 
the language is implemented on that particular computer, in order to code a program. The computer 
manufacturers or software designer will provide these specifics in their user's manual. Get a copy of the 
user's manual and study it before you begin to code. The differences may seem minor to you, but they 
may prevent your program from running. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Once coding is completed, the program must be debugged and tested before implementation. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Debugging 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Errors caused by faulty logic and coding mistakes are referred to as "bugs." Finding and correcting 
these mistakes and errors that prevent the program from running and producing correct output is called 
"debugging." 
</p><p class="paragraph">Rarely do complex programs run to completion on the first attempt. Often, time spent debugging and 
testing equals or exceeds the time spent in program coding. This is particularly true if insufficient time 
was spent on program definition and logic development. Some common mistakes which cause program 
bugs are mistakes in coding punctuation, incorrect operation codes, transposed characters, keying errors, 
and failure to provide a sequence of instructions (a program path) needed to process certain conditions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To reduce the number of errors, you will want to carefully check the coding sheets before they are 
keyed into the computer. This process is known as "desk-checking" and should include an examination 
for program completeness. Typical input data should be manually traced through the program processing 
paths to identify possible errors. In effect, you will be attempting to play the role of the computer. After 
you have desk checked the program for accuracy, the program is ready to be assembled or compiled. 
Assembly and compiler programs prepare your program (source program) to be executed by the 
computer, and they have error diagnostic features which detect certain types of mistakes in your program. 
These mistakes must be corrected. Even when an error-free pass of the program through the assembly or 
compiler program is accomplished, this does not mean your program is perfected. However, it usually 
means the program is ready for testing. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Testing 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Once a program reaches the testing stage, generally, it has proved it will run and produce output. The 
purpose of testing is to determine that all data can be processed correctly and that the output is correct. 
The testing process involves processing input test data that will produce known results. The test data 
should include: (1) typical data, which will test the commonly used program paths; (2) unusual but valid 
data, which will test the program paths used to process exceptions; (3) incorrect, incomplete, or 
inappropriate data, which will test the program's error routines. If the program does not pass these tests, 
more testing is required. You will have to examine the errors and review the coding to make the coding 
corrections needed. When the program passes these tests, it is ready for computer implementation. Before 
computer implementation takes place, documentation must be completed. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Documentation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Documentation is a continuous process, beginning with the problem definition. Documentation 
involves collecting, organizing, storing, and otherwise maintaining a complete record of the programs and 
other documents associated with the data processing system. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Navy has established documentation standards to ensure completeness and uniformity for 
computer system information between commands and between civilian and Navy organizations. 
SECNAVINST 5233.1 establishes minimum documentation requirements. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A documentation package should include: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. A definition of the problem. Why was the program written? What were the objectives? Who 
requested the program, and who approved it? These are the types of questions that should be 
answered. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. A description of the system. The system environment (hardware, software, and organization) in 
which the program functions should be described (including systems flowcharts). General 
systems specifications outlining the scope of the problem, the form and type of input data to be 
used, and the form and type of output required should be clearly defined. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. A description of the program. Programming flowcharts, program listings, program controls, test 
data, test results, and storage dumps  these and other documents that describe the program and 
give a historical record of problems and/or changes should be included. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Operator instructions. Items that should be included are computer switch settings, loading and 
unloading procedures, and starting, running, and termination procedures. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Implementation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">After the documentation is complete, and the test output is correct, the program is ready for use. If a 
program is to replace a program in an existing system, it is generally wise to have a period of parallel 
processing; that is, the job application is processed both by the old program and by the new program. The 
purpose of this period is to verify processing accuracy and completeness.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PACKAGED-SOFTWARE-3-23-">PACKAGED SOFTWARE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Fortunately you don't have to write a program for every problem to be solved. Instead, you can use 
packaged or off-the-shelf programs that are designed for specific classes of applications. Everyday more 
and more packaged software (software written by the manufacturer, a software house, or central design 
agency [CDA]) becomes available for general use. It may be up to you to set up and process a job within 
the specifications of a packaged program. Let's look at four classes of packaged software you may work 
with: word processing, data management, spreadsheets, and graphics. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WORD-PROCESSING-3-23-">WORD PROCESSING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">You can use word processing software for any function that involves text: letters, memos, forms, 
reports, and so on. At a minimum, it includes routines for creating, editing, storing, retrieving, and 
printing text. Under the word processing software control, you generally enter the text on the keyboard 
and it is printed on a display screen as shown in figure 3-8. At that point, you may store it on disk or tape, 
print it on a printer, or change (edit) it. Using the edit functions you can add or delete words, characters, 
lines, sentences, or paragraphs. You can rearrange text; for example, move a paragraph or block of 
information to another place in the same document or even move it to a different document. Word 
processing is particularly useful for text documents that are repetitive or that require a lot of revisions. It 
saves a lot of rekeying. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Other features and software often available with a word processing software package include: 
spelling checkers, mailing list programs, document compilation programs, and communications 
programs. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Spelling checker software helps find misspelled words but not misused words. It scans the text 
matching each word against a dictionary of words. If the word is not found in the dictionary, the system 
flags the word. You check it. If it is misspelled, you can correct it. You will still have to proofread the 
document to see that everything was keyed and that the words are used correctly. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Mailing list programs are for maintaining name and address files. They often include a capability to 
individualize letters and reports by inserting names, words, or phrases to personalize them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Document compilation programs are useful when you have standard paragraphs of information that 
you need to combine in different ways for various purposes. For example, you may be answering 
inquiries or putting together contracts or proposals. Once you select the standard paragraphs you want, 
you add variable information. This saves both keying and proofreading time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Communications software and hardware enable you to transmit and receive text on your 
microcomputer. Many organizations use this capability for electronic mail. In a matter of minutes you can 
enter and transmit a memo to other commands or to personnel in other locations. You can transmit 
monthly reports, notices, or any documents prepared on the microcomputer. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DATA-MANAGEMENT-3-24-">DATA MANAGEMENT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Data management software allows you to enter data and then retrieve it in a variety of ways. You 
define your data fields and set up a display screen with prompts. You enter the data records according to 
the prompts. Figure 3-9, view A, shows an example. The system writes the records on a disk or tape. 
Once you have a file keyed and stored, you can retrieve records by a field or several fields or by searching 
the records for specific data. For example, if you wanted a list of all personnel who reported aboard 
before January 1988, you could tell the system to search the file and print selected fields of all records 
that meet that condition. You tell the system what fields to print (that is name, rate, SSN, date reported) 
and where (what print positions) to print them. At the same time, you can specify in what order you want 
the records printed. For example, figure 3-9, view B, shows the records printed in alphabetical order by 
last name. The software also provides routines so you can easily add, delete, and change records.

the fields, and which data fields, if any, need to be combined. For example, your supply officer wants to

</h2><p class="paragraph">Spreadsheets are tables of rows and columns of numbers. Figure 3-10 shows an example. 
Spreadsheet processors allow you to set up a table of rows and columns and specify what calculations to 
perform on the columns. You enter values for the basic information into the appropriate rows and 
columns. Then the processor performs the calculations. In our example (fig. 3-10), we used a spreadsheet 
to project magnetic media costs. You enter the item descriptions, column headings, report title, and data 
for columns 1, 2, and 4, and the software calculates column 3 by adding columns 1 and 2. Then it 
multiplies column 3 times column 4 and puts the result in column 5. It also subtotals and totals the 
columns you specify; in this case, columns 1 through 3 and column 5. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-4-1-">INTRODUCTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">One of the major problems we face in using a digital computer is communicating with it. We must 
have one or more ways of getting data into the computer to be processed. You learned in chapter 2 that 
there are several types of input devices that read data into a computer. But how does one prepare the data 
to be used as input? How do we convert human-readable documents into a computer-readable form, and 
what type of input media do we use? If the data is to be used by another computer some distance away, 
how do we transmit it? Well, as you probably suspect, there are several ways to perform this conversion 
and transmission process, and that is the chapter of our discussion. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DATA-4-1-">DATA 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Data is a general term used to describe raw facts. To put it simply, data is nothing more than a 
collection of related elements or items, that when properly coded into some type of input medium, can be 
processed by a computer. Data items might include your service number, your name, your paygrade, or 
any other fact. Until some meaning has been given to the data, nothing can really be determined about it; 
therefore, it remains data. When this data has been processed together with other facts, it then has 
meaning and it becomes information we can understand and properly use. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DATA-REPRESENTATION-4-1-">DATA REPRESENTATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Data is represented by symbols. Symbols convey meaning only when understood. The symbol itself 
is not the information, but merely a representation of it. Symbol meaning is one of convention (fig. 4-1). 
Symbols may convey one meaning to you and me, another meaning to others, and no meaning at all to 
those that do not know their significance. Data must be reduced to a set of symbols that the computer can 
read and interpret before there can be any communication with the computer. The first computers were 
designed to manipulate numbers to solve arithmetic problems. But as you can see in figure 4-1, we create, </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

fortunate that early computer experts soon realized the need to manipulate nonnumerical symbols as well. 
Manipulating these symbols is possible if an identifying code or coded number is assigned to the symbol 
to be stored and processed. Thus, the letters in a name such as ALBERT or CAROL can be represented 
by different codes, as can all special characters, such as #, (,), &amp;, $, @, and yes, even the comma. The 
data to be represented is called source data. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SOURCE-DATA-4-2-">SOURCE DATA 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Source data or raw data is typically written on some type of paper document, which we refer to as a 
source document. The data contained on the source document must be converted into a machine-readable 
form for processing either by direct or indirect means. The data may be entered directly into the computer 
in its original form; namely right from the source document on which it is recorded by way of magnetic 
ink characters, optically recognizable characters, or bar code recognition. Or the data on the documents 
may be entered indirectly on input media, such as punched cards, paper tape, magnetic tape, or magnetic 
disk. It may also be keyed directly into a computer from a keyboard. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you look at figure 4-2, you see a list of SERVMART items that have been typed on a preprinted 
form. To most people this is just another piece of paper; however, to the Storekeeper (SK) it is a source 
document to be used to provide input data to the computer. In this example, the SERVMART form deals 
with requisitioning supplies. The form could be sent to the data-entry department to be used as a source 
document. There the data-entry operator can key the data into or on whatever computer medium is to be 
used, according to a prescribed format. The data elements are numbered in the order they are to be keyed: 
(1) document identification, (2) stock number, (3) unit of issue, (4) quantity, and so on. You'll notice we 
need more than numbers, and that is where coding systems come into play. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMPUTER-CODING-SYSTEMS-4-3-">COMPUTER CODING SYSTEMS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">To represent numeric, alphabetic, and special characters in a computer's internal storage and on 
magnetic media, we must use some sort of coding system. In computers, the code is made up of fixed size 
groups of binary positions. Each binary position in a group is assigned a specific value; for example 8, 4, 
2, or 1. In this way, every character can be represented by a combination of bits that is different from any 
other combination. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In this section you will learn how the selected coding systems are used to represent data. The coding 
systems included are Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC), and American 
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">EXTENDED BINARY CODED DECIMAL INTERCHANGE CODE (EBCDIC) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Using an 8-bit code, it is possible to represent 256 different characters or bit combinations. This 
provides a unique code for each decimal value 0 through 9 (for a total of 10), each uppercase and 
lowercase letter (for a total of 52), and for a variety of special characters. In addition to four numeric bits, 
four zone bit positions are used in 8-bit code as illustrated in figure 4-3. Each group of the eight bits 
makes up one alphabetic, numeric, or special character and is called a byte. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When you look at figure 4-3, you will notice that the four rightmost bits in EBCDIC are assigned 
values of 8, 4, 2, and 1. The next four bits to the left are called the zone bits. The EBCDIC coding chart 
for uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters and for the numeric digits 0 through 9 is shown in 
figure 4-4, with their hexadecimal equivalents. Hexadecimal is a number system used with some 
computer systems. It has a base of 16 (0-9 and A-F). A represents 10; B represents 11; C represents 12; D 
represents 13; E represents 14; and F represents 15. In EBCDIC, the bit pattern 1100 is the zone 
combination used for the alphabetic characters A through I, 1101 is used for the characters J through R, 
and 1110 is the zone combination used for characters S through Z. The bit pattern 1111 is the zone 
combination used when representing decimal digits. For example, the code 11000001 is equivalent to the 
letter A; the code 11110001 is equivalent to the decimal digit 1. Other zone combinations are used when 
forming special characters. Not all of the 256 combinations of 8-bit code have been assigned characters. 
Figure 4-5 illustrates how the characters DP-3 are represented using EBCDIC. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

8-bit code allows the representation of two numeric characters (decimal digits) as illustrated in figure 4-6. 
Representing two numeric characters in one byte (eight bits) is referred to as packing or packed data. By 
packing data (numeric characters only) in this way, it allows us to conserve the amount of storage space 
required, and at the same time, increases processing speed. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">Another 8-bit code, known as the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) 
(pronounced ASS-KEY), was originally designed as a 7-bit code. Several computer manufacturers 
cooperated to develop this code for transmitting and processing data. The purpose was to standardize a 
binary code to give the computer user the capability of using several machines to process data regardless 
of the manufacturer: IBM, HONEYWELL, UNIVAC, BURROUGHS, and so on. However, since most 
computers are designed to handle (store and manipulate) 8-bit code, an 8-bit version of ASCII was 
developed. ASCII is commonly used in the transmission of data through data communications and is used 
almost exclusively to represent data internally in microcomputers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The concepts and advantages of ASCII are identical to those of EBCDIC. The important difference 
between the two coding systems lies in the 8-bit combinations assigned to represent the various 
alphabetic, numeric, and special characters. When using ASCII 8-bit code, you will notice the selection of 
bit patterns used in the positions differs from those used in EBCDIC. For example, let's look at the 
characters DP3 in both EBCDIC and ASCII to see how they compare.

beginning with hexadecimal value 41 and continuing sequentially through hexadecimal value 5A. 
Similarly, lowercase letters are assigned hexadecimal values of 61 through 7A. The decimal values 1 
through 9 are assigned the zone code 0011 in ASCII rather that 1111 as in EBCDIC. Figure 4-7 is the

</h2><p class="paragraph">You learned in chapter 2 that a computer's primary storage area is divided into four areas, each 
serving a specific purpose. The input storage area accepts and holds input data to be processed. The 
working storage area holds intermediate processing results. The output storage area holds the final 
processing results. The program storage area holds the processing instructions (the program). You also 
learned that these separate areas do not have built-in physical boundaries, rather the boundaries are 
determined by the individual programs being used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You also may recall in chapter 2, we talked about the different types of primary storage used in 
computers and how they differ from one another. Some were magnetic in nature, such as magnetic core 
storage; others were electronic, such as semiconductor and bubble storage. For purposes of simplicity, we 
have selected magnetic core storage to show you how data is represented and stored in the computer's 
primary memory. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BITS-AND-BYTES-4-8-">BITS AND BYTES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A bit is a single binary digit. It represents the smallest unit of data just like the good old American 
penny). However, computers usually do not operate on single bits, rather they store and manipulate a 
fixed number of bits. Most often, the smallest unit or number of bits a computer works with is eight bits. 
These eight bits make up a byte. You just learned that both EBCDIC and ASCII codes use eight bits 
(excluding the parity bit), and that eight bits represent a single character, such as the letter A or the </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">number 7. Thus, the computer can store and manipulate an individual byte (a single character) or a group 
of bytes (several characters, a word) at a time. These individual bytes, or groups of bytes, form the basic 
unit of memory. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Primary storage capacities are usually specified in number of bytes. The symbol "K" is used 
whenever we refer to the size of memory, especially when the memory is quite large. The symbol K is 
equal to 1,024 units or positions of storage. Therefore, if a computer has 512K bytes (not bits) of primary 
storage, then it can hold 512 × 1,024 or 524,288 characters (bytes) of data in its memory. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MAGNETIC-CORE-STORAGE-4-9-">MAGNETIC CORE STORAGE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In primary storage, many magnetic cores are strung together on a screen of wire to form what is 
called a core plane (fig. 4-8, view A). As you may know, each core can store one binary bit (0 or 1) of 
data. A core is magnetized by current flowing through the wires on which the core is strung. Hence, a 
core magnetized in one direction represents a binary 0, and when magnetized in the opposite direction, a 
binary 1. It is the direction that the core is magnetized that determines whether it contains a binary 0 or a 
binary 1 (refer to fig. 4-8, view B). These core planes look very much like small window screens and are 
arranged vertically to represent data as shown in figure 4-8, view C. In looking at this figure, you will 
notice that nine planes are needed to code in 8-bit EBCDIC. The ninth plane provides for a parity (check) 
bit. Figure 4-8, view C, shows DP-3 in EBCDIC code, even parity.

the years several different design approaches to partition primary storage have been used. With this in 
mind, let's take a look at some of the ways primary storage is partitioned into addresses. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One way to design or organize the primary storage section is to store a fixed number of characters 
(bytes) at each address location. We can then reference these characters as a single entity called a word, as 
illustrated in figure 4-9, view A. The name CHARLIE  (address location 400) or the amount he is paid, in 
this case $69.00 (address location 401), are each treated as a single word. Computers that are built to </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

word-addressable machines, or fixed-word-length computers. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another way to design the primary storage section is to store a single character, such as the letter L 
or the number 8, in each address location. An address is assigned to each location in storage. Computers 
designed in this way are said to be character-oriented or character addressable. We also call them 
variable-word-length computers. Therefore, the name CHARLIE (fig. 4-9, view B) now requires seven 
address locations (300 through 306), while amount paid ($69.00) occupies six address locations (307 
through 312). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Whether a computer addresses a group of bytes as a word or addresses each byte individually is a 
function of the circuitry. Both designs have advantages and disadvantages. Variable-word-length 
computers make the most efficient use of available storage space, since a character can be placed in every 
storage location. In a fixed-word-length computer, storage space may be wasted. For example, if the 
storage capacity in each address of a fixed-word-length computer is eight bytes, and some of the data 
elements to be stored contain only three or four characters, then many of the storage positions in each 
word are not being used. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Fixed-word-length computers have faster calculating speeds. They can add two data words in a 
single operation. This is not so with character-addressable computers. Here, only one digit (byte) in each 
number can be added during a single machine operation. Thus, eight steps are required to complete the 
calculation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The larger mainframe computers (super-computers like the CRAY-1 and CYBER 205) use only 
fixed-word-length storage. Most microcomputers use the variable-word-length approach allowing them to 
operate on one character at a time. Somewhere in between these two extremes are the dozens of existing 
minicomputer and mainframe models that have what is called built-in flexibility. 
</p><p class="paragraph">These flexible computers are byte-oriented but can operate in either a fixed- or variable-word-length 
mode through the use of proper program instructions. Let's take a look at how these flexible computers 
operate in a variable- and fixed-word-length environment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Working in a variable-word-length environment, each address holds one alphanumeric character as 
shown in figure 4-9, view B. Since a byte usually represents a single alphanumeric character, unless you 
are using packed decimal, a flexible computer is often said to be byte-addressable. Don't become 
confused; the terms character-addressable, character-oriented, and byte-addressable all have the same 
meaning. By using the appropriate program instructions, a programmer can retrieve a stored data element 
by identifying the address of the first character (say position 300 as in fig. 4-9, view B) and specifying the 
number of address locations to be included in the word. In this case there are seven, positions 300 through 
306. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When a flexible computer is working in a fixed-word-length environment, each address identifies a 
group of bytes that can be operated on as a unit. This processing method helps to achieve faster 
calculating speeds. A programmer can use program instructions to cause the computer to automatically 
retrieve, manipulate, and store, as a unit, a fixed word of say, two, four, or eight bytes of data in one 
machine operation by identifying the address of the first character of data. At the same time all remaining 
bytes are acted upon as a unit moving from left to right. Figure 4-10 illustrates the different word lengths 
possible with many byte-addressable computers. They are half-word (2 bytes), full-word (4 bytes), and 
double-word (8 bytes). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

bits, characters (bytes), fields, records, and files (fig. 4-11). The following definitions should help you 
understand the relationship between bits, characters, bytes, words, fields, records, and files. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">BIT—The smallest unit of data; it represents one binary digit (0 or 1). 
</p><p class="paragraph">CHARACTER (BYTE)—A group of related bits (usually eight) that make up a single character-
letter, number, or special character. 
</p><p class="paragraph">WORD—A group of related bytes that are treated as a single addressable unit or entity in memory. 
</p><p class="paragraph">FIELD—One or more related characters that are treated as a unit of information. A field (also 
referred to as a data item) may be alphabetic, numeric, or alphanumeric, and may be either fixed or 
variable in length. For example, your social security number (SSN) is of a fixed length; that is, it's always 
9 positions in length. Whereas, names are variable length because they may be from 2 to 25 positions in 
length. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RECORD—A group of related fields, all pertaining to the same subject; a person, a thing, or an 
event. For example, your payroll record (LES statement) might include fields for your name, amount 
paid, taxes withheld, earned leave, and any allotments you might have. On the other hand, a supply 
inventory record might consist of fields containing stock number, the name of the item, its unit price, the 
quantity on hand, and its bin location. 
</p><p class="paragraph">FILE—A collection of related records, such as the payroll or supply inventory records. Normally, all 
records within the file are in the same format. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When processing data, we think in terms of data files. For example, to process a parts inventory, you 
would need the master parts inventory file and the file that contains up-to-date information on each part 
that has been issued. The master parts inventory file would have a record for every part in the inventory. 
The update file, parts issued file, would have a record for each part issued. You would use a program to 
read the records on the parts issued file and update the matching records on the master parts inventory 
file. Depending on whether the data is stored on magnetic tape or disk or in internal storage, the program 
would use different methods to access storage to obtain the data. In the next section you'll learn about 
storage access methods. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (LANs) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In local area networks (LANs), various machines are linked together within a building or adjacent

information within one universal system. With the ability to communicate, the dissimilar machines act as 
a team. The information that exists in one system can be reused without being reentered via keyboard or 
disk into another separate system. A universal system for the integration and exchange of information is 
connected to all input devices. The entire system is usually housed within the same building or the same 
geographic area. A local area network is made up of a communications facility (for example, a coaxial

countries throughout the world, through the expansion of local area networks into larger network 
configurations. Combinations of telephone lines, microwave radio links, and satellites are used by these 
larger telecommunications networks to send information. In 1965, the first successful communications 
satellite for business applications was launched. It was not the only try, it was preceded by many more 
primitive satellites. With the launching of larger and more complex satellites, the size and complexity of 
earth stations have been shrinking. Since satellite services' costs have been steadily decreasing, it is 
becoming more cost effective to employ them for business-type uses. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MODEMS-4-17-">MODEMS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Since both signals and data can be transmitted and received through cables (communications lines), 
we refer to them as input/output channels. And when we transmit data directly to a computer over long 
distances, it becomes necessary to add two other devices, one at each end of the communications line. 
These devices are called modems (fig. 4-13). The word modem is an acronym for modulator/ 
demodulator (combines first syllable of each word). A modem converts the digital signal produced by 
your terminal or the computer to an audio signal suitable for transmission over the communications line. 
The modem at the other end of the line converts the audio signal back to a digital signal before it is 
supplied to the computers or your terminal. If this conversion were not carried out, the digital signal 
would degenerate during transmission and become garbled.

forth from computer digital data to analog signals that can be transmitted over communications lines. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A modem never knows exactly when to expect data; therefore, it must be given some type of signal 
warning that data is about to be transmitted. This gives the modem time to get itself aligned and in 
synchronization with the incoming signal. Special characters, known as message characters, provide this 
warning and are placed in front of and behind the data to mark the beginning and ending of the message. 
Two methods are used: asynchronous and synchronous. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With asynchronous transmission, each character of data must be surrounded by message characters. 
As a result, more total bits must be transmitted (transferred) than would be necessary if the synchronous 
method were used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With synchronous transmission, only a single set of start and stop message characters is needed per 
block of data, thus allowing more characters to be transmitted per second. As you can see, synchronous 
transmission is more efficient and faster. However, it has the disadvantage of requiring a more complex 
and expensive modem than does asynchronous transmission. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You should be aware that whenever data is transferred between devices, it also involves an exchange 
of prearranged signals. This is known as handshaking. These signals, in combination with a prearranged 
pattern of message characters, define the rules for exchanging data over a communications line. The exact 
rules depend upon each individual computer manufacturer, the telephone company, and the related 
devices (the modems) that make up the computer system. Protocol is the term used for the specific set of 
rules that govern handshaking and message characters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the system illustrated in figure 4-14, data to be sent to the main computer's cpu is entered through 
a remote online user terminal (far left). As the data is keyed, it is keyed in digital form and sent to a 
nearby modem to be converted into an analog signal suitable for transmission. This converted data is then 
transmitted over the telephone (or land) lines to another modem, that is located near the main computer 
system's cpu. The data, now in digital form, can be sent directly to the cpu for processing. The same route 
is followed when information is sent from the cpu back to the remote terminal.

</h1><p class="paragraph">Congratulations! You have just finished the last chapter in Introduction to Digital Computers. In this 
chapter you learned about many things that were mentioned in other chapters, without a detailed 
explanation. This was done intentionally, as some of the subjects would have been too difficult and hard 
to understand without background knowledge. Through your study of chapters 1, 2, and 3, you gained 
enough knowledge to understand chapter 4. This chapter should have answered a lot of questions for you 
and made certain subjects more clear. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DATA is a general term used to describe raw facts like your service number, name, and paygrade. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SOURCE DATA is raw data typically written on some type of paper document. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DATA REPRESENTATION is accomplished by the use of symbols. The symbol itself is not the 
information, but merely a representation of it. Symbols convey meaning only when understood. In 
computers, symbols are represented by CODES. 
</p><p class="paragraph">COMPUTER CODING SYSTEMS are used to represent numeric, alphabetic, and special 
characters in computer storage and on magnetic media. 
</p><p class="paragraph">EXTENDED BINARY CODED DECIMAL INTERCHANGE CODE (EBCDIC) is an 8-bit 
code used in computers to represent numbers, letters, and special characters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">AMERICAN STANDARD CODE FOR INFORMATION INTERCHANGE (ASCII) is another 
8-bit code developed to standardize a binary code to give the computer user the capability of using several 
machines to process data regardless of the manufacturer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A PARITY (CHECK) BIT is used to detect errors in computer circuitry. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC CORE STORAGE is used as primary storage in some computers. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

tape. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DIRECT-ACCESS STORAGE is obtained by using magnetic disks and drums. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RANDOM-ACCESS STORAGE refers to magnetic core, semiconductor, thin film, and bubble 
storage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A NETWORK is any system composed of one or more computers and terminals; however, most are 
composed of multiple terminals and computers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (LANs) allow dissimilar machines to exchange information within 
one universal system within a building or small geographic area. 
</p><p class="paragraph">WIDE AREA NETWORKS provide for global connections and are sometimes referred to as global 
networks. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A MODEM converts the digital signal produced by your terminal or the computer to an audio signal 
suitable for transmission over a communications line. It also converts the audio signal back to a digital 
signal before it is supplied to your terminal or computer.
