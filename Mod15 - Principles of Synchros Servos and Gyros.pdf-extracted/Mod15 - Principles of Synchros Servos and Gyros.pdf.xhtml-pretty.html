SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current

</h2><p class="paragraph">Synchros play a very important role in the operation of Navy equipment. Synchros are found in just 
about every weapon system, communication system, underwater detection system, and navigation system 
used in the Navy. The importance of synchros is sometimes taken lightly because of their low failure rate. 
However, the technician who understands the theory of operation and the alignment procedures for 
synchros is well ahead of the problem when a malfunction does occur. The term "synchro" is an 
abbreviation of the word "synchronous." It is the name given to a variety of rotary, electromechanical, 
position-sensing devices. Figure 1-1 shows a phantom view of typical synchro. A synchro resembles a </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the transformer, uses the principle of electromagnetic induction. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Synchros are used primarily for the rapid and accurate transmission of information between 
equipment and stations. Examples of such information are changes in course, speed, and range of targets 
or missiles; angular displacement (position) of the ship's rudder; and changes in the speed and depth of 
torpedoes. This information must be transmitted quickly and accurately. Synchros can provide this speed 
and accuracy. They are reliable, adaptable, and compact. Figure 1-2 shows a simple synchro system that 
can be used to transmit different as of data or information In this system, a single synchro transmitter 
furnishes information to two synchro receivers located in distant spaces. Operators put information into 
the system by turning the handwheel. As the handwheel turns, its attached gear rotates the transmitter 
shaft (which has a dial attached to indicate the value of the transmitted information). As the synchro 
transmitter shaft turns, it converts the mechanical input into an electrical signal, which is sent through 
interconnecting wiring to the two synchro receivers. The receiver shafts rotate in response to the electrical 
signal from the transmitter. When these shafts turn, the dials attached to the shafts indicate the transmitted 
information.

</p><p class="paragraph">By studying the simple synchro system, you can see that information can be transmitted over long 
distances, from space to space, and from equipment to equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to supplying data by positioning dials and pointers, synchros are also used as control 
devices in servo systems. When the synchro and the servo are combined, they work as a team to move 
and position heavy loads. The methods used to accomplish this are covered in detail in the next chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-1. What is the name given to a variety of rotary electromechanical, position sensing devices? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-2. What is the primary purpose of a synchro system? 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SYNCHRO-CLASSIFICATION-1-4-">SYNCHRO CLASSIFICATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Synchros work in teams. Two or more synchros interconnected electrically form a synchro system. 
There are two general classifications of synchro systems—TORQUE SYSTEMS AND CONTROL 
SYSTEMS. Torque-synchro systems use torque synchros and control-synchro systems use control 
synchros. The load dictates the type of synchro system, and thus the type of synchro. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Torque-synchro systems are classified "torque" because they are mainly concerned with the torque or 
turning force required to move light loads such as dials, pointers, or similar indicators. The positioning of 
these devices requires a relatively low amount of torque. Control synchros are used in systems that are 
designed to move heavy loads such as gun directors, radar antennas, and missile launchers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to the two general classifications, synchros are grouped into seven basic functional 
classes as shown in table 1-1. Four of these are the torque type and three are the control type. Each 
synchro is described in the table by name, abbreviation, input, output, and the other synchro units that 
may be connected to it. Generally, torque and control synchros may not be interchanged. The functional 
operation of each of these seven synchros is covered later in this text.

specifications that are uniform throughout the armed services. New varieties of equipment use synchros 
of this type. Prestandard synchros were designed to meet Navy, rather than servicewide, specifications. 
Each category has its own designation code for identification. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Military Standard Synchro Code 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The military standard designation code identifies standard synchros by their physical size, functional 
purpose, and supply voltage characteristics. The code is alphanumerical and is broken down in the 
following manner. The first two digits indicate the diameter of the synchro in tenths of an inch, to the next 
higher tenth. For example, a synchro with a diameter of 1.75 inches has the numeral 18 as its first two 
digits. The first letter indicates the general function of the synchro and of the synchro system-C for 
control or T for torque. The next letter indicates the specific function of the synchro, as follows:

R Receiver 
T Transformer 
X Transmitter 
</h3><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the letter B follows the specific function designation, the synchro has a rotatable stator. The last 
number in the designation indicates the operating frequency-6 for 60 Hz and 4 for 400 Hz. The upper-case 
letter following the frequency indicator is the modification designation. The letter "A" indicates that the 
synchro design is original. The first modification is indicated by the letter "B." Succeeding modifications 
are indicated by the letters "C," "D," and so on, except for the unused letters "I," "L," "O," and "Q." 
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, an 18TR6A synchro is an original design, 60-Hz torque receiver with a diameter of 
between 1.71 and 1.80 inches. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A synchro designated 16CTB4B is the first modification of a 400-Hz control transformer with a 
rotatable stator and a diameter of between 1.51 and 1.60 inches. 
</p><p class="paragraph">All standard synchros are labeled with such a code. Synchros used in circuits supplied by 26 volts 
are classified in the same way, except that the symbol 26V is prefixed to the designator (for example, 
26V-16CTB4A). Otherwise, a 115 volts source is assumed for the synchro system. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Navy Prestandard Synchro Code

number and letter combination. Unlike the standard code, the number does not indicate directly the 
diameter of the synchro. The number merely represents the approximate size of the synchro, increasing as 
the size increases. The approximate size and weight of the five most common sizes are shown in the

Arabic number, are used to identify the rotor and stator connections; for example, R1, R2, S1, S2, and S3.

</p><p class="paragraph">In this section we will discuss how rotors and stators are constructed and how the synchro is 
assembled. Each synchro contains a rotor, similar in appearance to the armature in a motor, and a stator, 
which corresponds to the field in a motor. The synchro stator is composed of three Y-connected  windings 
(S1, S2, and S3). The rotor is composed of one single winding (R1 and R2). As you can see in the figure, 
the rotor winding is free to turn inside the stator. The rotor is usually the primary winding and receives its 
voltage (excitation) from an external voltage source. The stator receives its voltage from the rotor by 
magnetic coupling. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ROTOR-CONSTRUCTION-1-10-">ROTOR CONSTRUCTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are two common types of synchro rotors in use-the SALIENT-POLE ROTOR and the DRUM

</p><p class="paragraph">The drum or wound rotor has coils wound in slots in a laminated core as shown in figure 1-6. This 
type of rotor is used in most synchro control transformers and differential units, and occasionally in 
torque transmitters. It may be wound continuously with a single length of wire or may have a group of 
coils connected in series. The single continuous winding provides a distributed winding effect for use in 
transmitters. When the rotor is wound with a group of coils connected in series, a concentrated winding 
effect is provided for use in control transformers. When used in differential units, the rotor is wound with 
three coils so their magnetic axes are 120º apart. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Both types of synchro rotors have their coils wound on laminated cores that are rigidly mounted on a 
shaft. To enable the excitation voltage to be applied to the rotor winding, two slip rings are mounted on 
one end of the shaft and insulated from the shaft to prevent shorting. An insulated terminal board, 
mounted on the end of the cylindrical frame, houses the brushes, which ride on the slip rings. These 
brushes provide continuous electrical contact to the rotor during its rotation. Also mounted on the rotor 
shaft are low-friction ball bearings, which permit the rotor to turn easily.

consisting of the laminated stator, stator windings, and cylindrical frame; view B shows the stator 
lamination and the slots in which the windings are placed. Some synchros are constructed so both the

</p><p class="paragraph">characteristics found in synchro systems. In general, the load capacity of a synchro system is limited by 
the number and types of receiver units loading the transmitter, the loads on these receiver units, and the 
operating temperature. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TORQUE-1-13-">TORQUE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Torque is simply a measure of how much load a machine can turn. In torque synchros, only small 
loads are turned; therefore, only a small amount of torque is required. The measure of torque is the 
product of the applied force and the distance between the point of application and the center of rotation. 
For instance, if a 3 ounce weight is suspended from a synchro pulley having a radius of 2 inches, the 
torque required to move the weight is 6 ounce-inches. In heavy machinery, torque may be expressed in 
pound-feet, but torque synchro measurements are in ounce-inches. 
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: The unit of torque is the pound-foot or ounce-inch. Do not confuse this with foot-pounds, 
which is the measurement of work. Many times in referring to torque, tools are marked in foot-pounds. 
While this use of foot-pounds is technically incorrect, common usage has made it acceptable. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The torque developed in a synchro receiver results from the tendency of two electromagnets to align 
themselves. Since the rotor can be turned and the stator usually cannot, the stator must exert a force 
(torque) tending to pull the rotor into a position where the primary and secondary magnetic fields are in 
line. The strength of the magnetic field produced by the stator determines the torque. The field strength 
depends on the current through the stator coils. As the current through the stator is increased, the field 
strength increases and more torque is developed.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Military standard and Navy prestandard synchros are designed to operate on either 115 volts or 26 
volts. Synchros used in shipboard equipment are designed predominately for 115 volts, while most 
aircraft synchros operate on 26 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Synchros are also designed to operate on a 60- or 400-Hz frequency.  But like transformers, they are 
more efficient at the higher frequency.  Operating a synchro at a higher frequency also permits it to be 
made physically smaller. This is because the lines of flux produced by the 400-Hz excitation voltage are 
much more concentrated than those produced by the 60-Hz excitation voltage. Hence, the core of the 400-
Hz synchro can be made smaller than the core of the 60-Hz synchro. However, some 400-Hz synchro 
units are identical in size to their 60-Hz counterparts. This is done so that 60- and 400-Hz units can be 
physically interchanged without special mounting provisions.  The operating voltage and frequency of 
each synchro is marked on its nameplate. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The use of the smaller size synchro permits the construction of smaller and more compact 
equipment. The most widely used frequency for airborne equipment is 400 Hz. It is being used 
increasingly in shipboard equipment as well. The newer gun and missile fire-control systems use 400-Hz 
synchros almost exclusively. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A synchro designed for 60-Hz operation may occasionally be used with a 400-Hz supply. There may 
be considerable loss of accuracy, but the synchro will not be damaged. This should be done only in the

(-25º C to +85º C). When a synchro is energized and not loaded, its temperature should stay within 
prescribed limits. Loading an energized synchro causes it to generate more heat. Similarly, overloading 
causes a synchro to generate much more heat than it would under normal loading conditions and could 
possibly result in permanent synchro damage. To meet military specifications, all standard synchros must 
be capable of continuous operation for 1,000 hours at 1,200 revolutions per minute (rpm) without a load. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A prestandard synchro has one of two specifications, depending upon its use in a data transmission

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THEORY-OF-OPERATION-1-14-">THEORY OF OPERATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Synchros, as stated earlier, are simply variable transformers. They differ from conventional 
transformers by having one primary winding (the rotor), which may be rotated through 360º and three 
stationary secondary windings (the stator) spaced 120º apart. It follows that the magnetic field within the 
synchro may also be rotated through 360º. If an iron bar or an electromagnet were placed in this field and 
allowed to turn freely, it would always tend to line up in the direction of the magnetic field. This is the 
basic principle underlying all synchro operations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">We will begin the discussion of synchro operation with a few basic points on electromagnets. Look 
at figure 1-8. In this figure, a simple electromagnet is shown with a bar magnet pivoted in the 
electromagnet's field. In view A, the bar is forced to assume the position shown, since the basic law of 
magnetism states that like poles of magnets repel and unlike poles attract. Also notice that when the bar is 
aligned with the field, the magnetic lines of force are shortest. If the bar magnet is turned from this 
position and held as shown in view B, the flux is distorted and the magnetic lines of force are lengthened. 
In this condition, a force (torque) is exerted on the bar magnet. When the bar magnet is released, it snaps 
back to its original position. When the polarity of the electromagnet is reversed, as shown in view C, the 
field reverses and the bar magnet is rotated 180º from its original position. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Keeping in mind these basic points, consider how the bar magnet reacts to three electromagnets 
spaced 120º  apart as illustrated in figure 1-9. In this figure, stator coils S1 and S3, connected in parallel, 
together have the same field strength as stator coil S2. The magnetic field is determined by current flow 
through the coils. The strongest magnetic field is set up by stator coil S2, since it has twice the current and 
field strength as either S1 or S3 alone. A resultant magnetic field is developed by the combined effects of 
the three stator fields. Coil S2 has the strongest field, and thus, the greatest effect on the resultant field, 
causing the field to align in the direction shown by the vector in view B of the figure. The iron-bar rotor 
aligns itself within the resultant field at the point of greatest flux density. By convention, this position is 
known as the zero-degree position. The rotor can be turned from this position to any number of positions 
by applying the proper combination of voltages to the three coils, as illustrated in figure 1-10, view (A),

</p><p class="paragraph">Notice in figure 1-10, in views A C, and E, that the rotor positions are achieved by shifting the total 
current through different stator windings (S1, S2, and S3). This causes the rotor to move toward the coil 
with the strongest magnetic field. To obtain the rotor positions in views B, D, and F, it was necessary only 
to reverse the battery connections. This causes the direction of current flow to reverse and in turn reverses 
the direction of the magnetic field. Since the rotor follows the magnetic field the rotor also changes 
direction. By looking closely at these last three rotor positions, you will notice that they are exactly 
opposite the first three positions we discussed. This is caused by the change in the direction of current 
flow. You can now see that by varying the voltages to the three stator coils, we can change the current in 
these coils and cause the rotor to assume any position we desire. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the previous examples, dc voltages were applied to the coils. Since synchros operate on ac rather 
than dc, consider what happens when ac is applied to the electromagnet in figure 1-11. During one 
complete cycle of the alternating current, the polarity reverses twice. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, the number of times the polarity reverses each second is twice the excitation frequency, or 
120 times a second when a 60-Hz frequency is applied. Since the magnetic field of the electromagnet 
follows this alternating current, the bar magnet is attracted in one direction during one-half cycle (view A) 
and in the other direction during the next half cycle (view B). Because of its inertia, the bar magnet 
cannot turn rapidly enough to follow the changing magnetic field and may line up with either end toward 
the coil (view C). This condition also causes weak rotor torque. For these reasons, the iron-bar rotor is not 
practical for ac applications. Therefore, it must be replaced by an electromagnetic rotor as illustrated in 
figure 1-12. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

vary widely, depending upon design and application, but there is commonly a 2.2:1 stepdown between the 
rotor and a single coil. Thus, when 115 volts is applied to the rotor, the highest value of effective voltage 
induced in any one stator coil is 52 volts. The maximum induced voltage occurs each time there is 
maximum magnetic coupling between the rotor and the stator coil (views A, C, and E). The effective

</h2><p class="paragraph">Synchro torque receivers, commonly called synchro receivers, are electrically identical to torque 
transmitters of the same size except for the addition of some form of damping. In some sizes of 400-Hz 
synchros, units are designated as torque receivers but may be used as either transmitters or receivers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Unlike the transmitter, the receiver has an electrical input to its stator and a mechanical output from 
its rotor. The synchro receiver's function is to convert the electrical data supplied to its stator from the 
transmitter, back to a mechanical angular position through the movement of its rotor. This function is 
accomplished when the rotor is connected to the same ac source as the transmitter and assumes a position 
determined by the interaction of its magnetic field with the magnetic field of the stator. If you recall, this 
is the same concept discussed earlier under the operation of electromagnets. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Normally, the receiver rotor is unrestrained in movement except for brush and bearing friction. 
When power is first applied to a system, the transmitter position changes quickly; or if the receiver is 
switched into the system, the receiver rotor turns to correspond to the position of the transmitter rotor. 
This sudden motion can cause the rotor to oscillate (swing back and forth) around the synchronous 
position If the movement of the rotor is great enough, it may even spin. Some method of preventing 
oscillations or spinning must be used. Any method that accomplishes this task is termed DAMPING. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two types of damping methods ELECTRICAL and MECHANICAL. In small synchros the 
electrical method is used more frequently than the mechanical method. This method uses an additional 
winding placed in the synchro to retard oscillations. In larger units, a mechanical device, known as an 
inertia damper, is more effective. Several variations of the inertia damper are in use. One of the more 
common types consists of a heavy brass flywheel (inertia damper), which is free to rotate around a 
bushing that is attached to the rotor shaft (fig. 1-15). A tension spring on the bushing rubs against the 
flywheel so that the bushing and flywheel turn together during normal operation. If the rotor shaft turns or 
tends to change its speed or direction of rotation suddenly, the inertia of the damper opposes the changing 
condition. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">A torque transmitter (TX) and a torque receiver (TR) make up a simple torque-synchro system. 
Basically, the electrical construction of synchro transmitters and receivers is similar, but their intended 
functions are different. The rotor of a synchro transmitter is usually geared to a manual or mechanical 
input. This gearing may drive a visual indicator showing the value or quantity being transmitted. The 
rotor of the receiver synchronizes itself electrically with the position of the rotor of the transmitter and 
thus responds to the quantity being transmitted.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A simple synchro transmission system consisting of a torque transmitter connected to a torque 
receiver (TX-TR) is illustrated in figure 1-16. As you can see, in this system the rotors are connected in 
parallel across the ac line. The stators of both synchros have their leads connected S1 to S1, S2 to S2, and 
S3 to S3, so the voltage in each of the transmitter stator coils opposes the voltage in the corresponding 
coils of the receiver. The voltage directions are indicated by arrows for the instant of time shown by the 
dot on the ac line voltage. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When both transmitter and receiver rotors in a synchro system are on zero or displaced from zero by 
the same angle, a condition known as CORRESPONDENCE exists. In view A of figure 1-16, the 
transmitter and receiver are shown in correspondence. In this condition, the rotor of the TR induces 
voltages in its stator coils (S2 = 52V; S1 and S3 = 26V) that are equal to and opposite the voltages 
induced into the TX stator coils (S2 = 52V; S1 and S3 = 26V). This causes the voltages to cancel and 
reduces the stator currents to zero. With zero current through the coils, the receiver torque is zero and the 
system remains in correspondence.

the S3 coil voltage reversing direction, and the S1 coil voltage increasing to 52 volts. This imbalance in 
voltages, between the transmitter and receiver, causes current to flow in the stator coils in the direction of 
the stronger voltages. The current flow in the receiver produces a resultant magnetic field in the receiver 
stator in the same direction as the rotor field in the transmitter. A force (torque) is now exerted on the 
receiver rotor by the interaction between its resultant stator field and the magnetic field around its rotor. 
This force causes the rotor to turn through the same angle as the rotor of the transmitter. As the receiver </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

synchros are equal and opposite (S1 = 52V; S2 and S3 = 26V), the rotor torque is zero, and the rotors are 
displaced from zero by the same angle (60º). This sequence of events causes the transmitter and receiver 
to stay in correspondence.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Receiver Rotation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When the teeth of two mechanical gears are meshed and a turning force is applied, the gears turn in 
opposite directions. If a third gear is added, the original second gear turns in the same direction as the 
first. This is an important concept, because the output of a synchro receiver is often connected to the 
device it operates through a train of mechanical gears. Whether or not the direction of the force applied to 
the device and the direction in which the receiver rotor turns are the same depends on whether the number 
of gears in the train is odd or even. The important thing, of course, is to move the dial or other device in 
the proper direction. Even when there are no gears involved, the receiver rotor may turn in the direction 
opposite to the direction you desire. To correct this problem, some method must be used to reverse the 
receiver's direction of rotation. In the transmitter-receiver system, this is done by reversing the S1 and S3 
connections so that SI of the transmitter is connected to S3 of the receiver and vice versa (fig. 1-17), view 
(A) and view (B).

</p><p class="paragraph">Even when the S1 and S3 connections are reversed, the system at 0º acts the same as the basic 
synchro system we previously described at 0º. This is because the voltages induced in the S1 and S3 
stator windings are still equal and oppose each other. This causes a canceling effect, which results in zero 
stator current and no torque. Without the torque required to move the receiver rotor, the system remains in 
correspondence and the reversing of the stator connections has no noticeable effect on the system at 0º. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Suppose the transmitter rotor is turned counterclockwise 60º, as shown in view A of figure 1-17. The 
TX rotor is now aligned with S1. This results in maximum magnetic coupling between the TX rotor and 
the S1 winding. This maximum coupling induces maximum voltage in S1. Because S1 is connected to S3 
of the TR, a voltage imbalance occurs between them. As a result of this voltage imbalance, maximum 
current flows through the S3 winding of the TR causing it to have the strongest magnetic field. Because 
the other two fields around S2 and S1 decrease proportionately, the S3 field has the greatest effect on the 
resultant TR stator field. The strong S3 stator field forces the rotor to turn 60º clockwise into alignment 
with itself, as shown in view B. At this point, the rotor of the TR induces canceling voltages in its own 
stator coils and causes the rotor to stop. The system is now in correspondence. Notice that by reversing S1 
and S3, both synchro rotors turn the same amount, but in OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. 
</p><p class="paragraph">We must emphasize that the only stator leads ever interchanged, for the purpose of reversing receiver 
rotation, are S1 and S3. S2 cannot be reversed with any other lead since it represents the electrical zero 
position of the synchro. As you know, the stator leads in a synchro are 120º apart. Therefore, any change 
in the S2 lead causes a 120º error in the synchro system and also reverses the direction of rotation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In new or modified synchro systems, a common problem is the accidental reversal of the R1 and R2 
leads on either the transmitter or receiver. This causes a 180º error between the two synchros, but the 
direction of rotation remains the same. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-28. What two receiver leads are reversed to reverse the rotor's direction of rotation?

error. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Obviously, the simple synchro transmitter-receiver system discussed so far could not handle a job of 
this sort. A different type of synchro is needed, one which can accept two signals simultaneously, add or 
subtract the signals, and furnish an output proportional to their sum or difference. This is where the 
SYNCHRO DIFFERENTIAL enters the picture. A differential can perform all of these functions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two types of differential units - differential transmitters and differential receivers. The 
differential transmitter (TDX) accepts one electrical input and one mechanical input and produces one 
electrical output. The differential receiver (TDR) accepts two electrical inputs and produces one 
mechanical output. A comparison of the TDX and TDR is shown in figure 1-18. The torque differential 
transmitter and the torque differential receiver can be used to form a DIFFERENTIAL SYNCHRO 
SYSTEM. The system can consist either of a torque transmitter (TX), a torque differential transmitter 
(TDX), and a torque receiver (TR), (TX-TDX-TR); or two torque transmitters (TXs) and one torque 
differential receiver (TDR), (TX-TDR-TX). Before beginning a discussion of the systems using 
differentials, we need to provide a brief explanation on the newly introduced synchros, the TDX and the 
TDR. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Torque Differential Transmitter 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the torque differential transmitter, BOTH the rotor and stator windings consist of three Y-
connected coils, as illustrated in view A of figure 1-19. The stator is normally the primary, and receives 
its input signal from a synchro transmitter. The voltages appearing across the differential's rotor terminals 
(R1, R2, and R3) are determined by the magnetic field produced by the stator currents, the physical 
positioning of the rotor, and the step-up turns ratio between the stator and the rotor. The magnetic field, 
created by the stator currents, assumes an angle corresponding to that of the magnetic field in the 
transmitter supplying the signal. The position of the rotor controls the amount of magnetic coupling that 
takes place between the stator magnetic field and the rotor, and therefore, the amount of voltage induced 
into the rotor windings. If the rotor position changes in response to a mechanical input, then the voltages 
induced into its windings also change. Therefore, the output voltage of the TDX varies as a result of either 
a change in the input stator voltage or a change in the mechanical input to the rotor. This electrical output 
of the TDX may be either the SUM or the DIFFERENCE of the two inputs depending upon how the three 
units (the TX, the TDX, and the TR) are connected. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

ELECTRICALLY IDENTICAL. The only difference in their construction is that the receiver (TDR) has a 
damper, which serves the same purposes as the damper in the TR — it prevents the rotor from oscillating. 
The real difference in the receiver lies in its application. It provides the mechanical output for a 
differential synchro system usually as the sum or difference of two electrical inputs from synchro 
transmitters. As in the case with the TDX, the TDR addition or subtraction function depends upon how 
the units in the system are connected. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Basically, the torque differential receiver operates like the electromagnets we discussed earlier in this 
chapter. In view B, the rotor and stator of the torque differential receiver receive energizing currents from 
two torque transmitters. These currents produce two resultant magnetic fields, one in the rotor and the 
other in the stator. Each magnetic field assumes an angle corresponding to that of the magnetic field in the 
transmitter supplying the signal. It is the interaction of these two resultant magnetic fields that causes the 
rotor in the TDR to turn. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

other synchros to add and subtract. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To understand how a TDX subtracts one input from another, first consider the conditions in a TX-
TDX-TR system when all the rotors are on 0º, as in view A of figure 1-20. In this case, the TDX is on 
electrical zero and merely passes along the voltages applied to its windings without any change. 
Therefore, the TX stator voltages are felt at the TDX rotor. With the system in perfect balance, the TDX 
rotor voltages equal and oppose the TR stator voltages so that no current flows in the circuit. Since there 
is no current to produce the torque required to move the TR rotor, the system will remain in this 
condition, thus solving the equation 0º − 0º  = 0º.

</p><p class="paragraph">Up to this point, we have discussed the number of degrees a rotor is turned. Now, it is important to 
point out the labeling of synchro positions. Labeling is necessary to determine the actual position of the 
synchro's rotor. Notice that synchro rotor positions are labeled from 0º, increasing in a counterclockwise 
direction. It is common practice to refer to a synchro transmitter as being on 120º when its rotor is 
pointing toward the S3 winding. Do not confuse these positions with the number of degrees a rotor is 
turned. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume that a 240º input is applied to the system, as indicated in view B, by turning the TX rotor to 
its 240º position. At this position maximum voltage is induced into the S1 winding of the TX and coupled 
to S1 of the TDX. Since the TDX rotor is on 0º, it passes this maximum voltage (via R1) along to the S1 
winding of the TR. The stator magnetic field in the receiver now lines up in the direction of the S1 
winding and causes the rotor to turn counterclockwise to the 240º position. This illustrates an important 
point: 
</p><p class="paragraph">Whenever the TDX rotor is at 0º, the TR rotor follows the TX rotor exactly. In the present case, the 
system has just solved the equation 240º − 0º  = 240º. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before we go to another example, you need to understand that when you subtract a higher value of 
degrees from a lower value of degrees, you add 360º to the lower value and subtract directly. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">For example: 10º - 260º 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">Add 360º to lower value: 10º  + 360º  = 370º 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">Subtract: 370º − 260º  = 110º 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the next example, hold the TX rotor on 0º and turn the TDX rotor to 120º, as illustrated in view C 
of figure 1-20. In this situation, R1 of the TDX has maximum voltage induced in its winding since it is in 
line with S2. With R1 of the TDX connected to S1 of the TR, the TR stator magnetic field lines up in the 
direction of S1 and causes the TR rotor to turn clockwise to the 240º position. Given, then, that the TX is 
on 360º  (or the 0º position), and subtracting the 120º displacement of the TDX rotor, the difference is 
240º. This is the position at which the TR rotor comes to rest. Therefore, the system has solved the 
equation 360º − 120º  = 240º. The actual subtraction operation of the TDX is a little more apparent in the 
next example. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Now, consider what happens in view D when the TX rotor is turned manually to 75º and the TDX 
rotor is set manually on 30º. When the TX rotor is turned to 75º, magnetic coupling increases between the 
rotor and S1. This, in turn, increases the voltage in S1 and, therefore, the magnetic field surrounding it. At 
the same time, the field in S2 and S3 decreases proportionately. This causes the resultant TX stator field 
to line up in the direction of its rotor. The increased voltage in S1 of the TX also causes an increase in 
current flow through S1 in the TDX, while decreased currents flow through S2 and S3. Therefore, a 
strong magnetic field is established around the S1 winding in the TDX. This field has the greatest effect 
on the resultant TDX stator field and causes it to line up in the same relative direction as the TX stator 
field (75º). The TDX stator field does not move from this 75º position because it is controlled by the 
position of the TX rotor. However, its angular position with respect to the R2 winding decreases by 30 
when the TDX rotor is turned. Therefore, the signal induced into the TDX rotor and transmitted to the TR 
is 45º. The TR rotor responds to the transmitted signal and turns counterclockwise to 45º. This system has 
just solved the equation 75º − 30º  = 45º. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">TX-TDX-TR System Operation (Addition) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Frequently it is necessary to set up a TX-TDX-TR system for addition. This is done by reversing the 
S1 and S3 leads between the TX and the TDX, and the R1 and R3 leads between the TDX and the TR. 
With these connections, the system behaves as illustrated in figure 1-21. Consider what happens when the 
TX rotor is turned to 75º, while the TDX is set at 0º view A. In the TX, with the rotor at 75º, increased 
coupling between the rotor and S1 increases the current in, and consequently the magnetic field around, 
that coil. At the same time, the field strengths of S2 and S3 decrease proportionately. This causes the 
resultant field of the TX stator to rotate counterclockwise and align itself with its rotor field. The system 
is now connected so the increased current in S1 of the TX flows through S3 of the TDX, while decreased 
currents flow through S1 and S2. Therefore, in the TDX, the resultant stator field is shifted 75º clockwise 
because of the stronger field around S3. Since the rotor of the TDX is on 0º, the voltage in the rotor is not 
changed but simply passed on to the TR. Remember, the R1 and R3 leads between the TDX and the TR 
have also been reversed. Just as in the simple TX-TR system with S1 and S3 leads interchanged, torque is 
developed in the TR, which turns the rotor in a direction opposite to the rotation of the TDX stator field. 
Therefore, the TR rotor rotates 75º counterclockwise and aligns itself with the TX rotor. Thus, the TX-
TDX-TR system connected for addition behaves in the same way as the system connected for subtraction 
as long as the TDX rotor remains on 0º. When this condition exists, the TR rotor follows the TX rotor 
exactly. As you can see, the system in view. A just solved the equation 75º  + 0º  = 75º.

rotation of the TDX stator field. In transmitting the TX signal to the TR, the TDX adds the amount its

receiver then provided the system's mechanical output. When the differential receiver (TDR) is used, the 
TDR itself provides the system's mechanical output. This output is usually the sum or difference of the 
electrical signals received from two synchro transmitters. Figure 1-22 shows a system consisting of two 
TXs (No. 1 and No. 2) and a TDR connected for subtraction.

a similar manner, the signal from TX No. 2 rotates the resultant TDR rotor field counterclockwise 30º. 
Since the two resultant fields are not rotated by equal amounts, a torque is exerted on the rotor to bring 
the two fields into alignment. This torque causes the rotor to turn to 45º, the point at which the two fields 
are aligned. To bring the two fields into alignment, the TDR rotor need turn only through an angle equal 
to the difference between the signals supplied by the two TXs.

reversed, its rotor field rotates 30º clockwise. The angular displacement of the two fields then, with 
respect to each other, is the sum of the signals transmitted by the two TXs. The magnetic force pulling the 
TDR rotor field into alignment with that of the stator turns the TDR rotor to 105º. Therefore, the system

control transmitter or torque receiver, except that there is no damper and the rotor is a drum or wound 
rotor rather than a salient-pole rotor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An interesting point about the rotor is that it is never connected to an ac supply and, therefore, 
induces no voltages in the stator coils. As a result, the CT stator currents are determined solely by the 
voltages applied to the high-impedance stator windings. The rotor itself is wound so that its position has 
very little effect on the stator currents. Also, there is never any appreciable current flowing in the rotor 
because its output voltage is always applied to a high-impedance load. As a result, the CT rotor does not 
try to follow the magnetic field of its stator and must be turned by some external force. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The stator windings of the CT are considered to be the primary windings, and the rotor windings the

figure 1-25. The stator windings of the CX are connected to the stator windings of the CT and both 
synchros are shown on 0º. Notice, that at 0º, the CT rotor is perpendicular to its S2 winding. This is 
contrary to what we have learned so far about synchros, but it is just another peculiarity of the CT. When 
the rotor of the CX is on 0º, the rotor's magnetic field points straight up as shown (the black arrow). The

windings through the three leads connecting the S1, S2, and S3 terminals. Exciting currents proportional 
to these voltages flow in the CT stator windings and establish a magnetic field in the CT in the same

this coupling, the stator windings induce a maximum of 55 volts into the rotor winding. The phase of this 
voltage depends upon the direction in which the CT rotor is turned. The rotor of the CT is wound so that 
clockwise rotation of the stator magnetic field induces a voltage across the rotor which is proportional to 
the amount of rotation and in phase with the ac supply voltage. Counterclockwise rotation of the stator 
magnetic field produces a voltage that is still proportional to the amount of rotation, but 180º out of phase 
with the supply voltage. Keep in mind that the clockwise rotation of the CT stator magnetic field is the 
same as the counterclockwise rotation of the CT rotor. This phase relationship between the ac supply

CX (black arrow) and the magnetic field in the CT (white arrow) also rotate 60º clockwise. This action 
induces a voltage in the CT rotor that is in phase with the ac supply, as indicated by the oscilloscope 
presentation. If the rotor of the CX in view B is turned 60º in a counterclockwise direction from its 0º  
position, the magnetic field (white arrow) in the CT also rotates counterclockwise through the same 
number of degrees as the CX. Since the magnetic field in the stator of the CT cuts through the rotor in the 
opposite direction, the induced voltage in the rotor is now out of phase with the ac supply to the CX, as 
shown in the oscilloscope presentation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At times it is necessary, because the CT is used to control servo systems, to have the CT output 
reduced to zero volts to prevent any further movement of a load. To accomplish this, it is necessary to 
turn the rotor of the CT through the same number of degrees and in the same direction as the rotor of the 
CX. This places the CT rotor perpendicular to its own stator field and reduces its output to zero volts as 
illustrated in view C. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The CT output voltage discussed throughout this section is commonly referred to as an ERROR

out of correspondence. It is this error signal that eventually is used in moving the load in a typical servo 
system. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now that we have covered the basic operation of the control synchro system, let us see how this 
system works with a servo system to move heavy equipment. Figure 1-28 shows a block diagram of a 
typical servo system that uses a control synchro system. Assume the shaft of the CX in this system is 
turned by some mechanical input. This causes an error signal to be generated by the CT because the CX 
and the CT rotors are now out of correspondence. The error signal is amplified by the servoamplifier and 
applied to the servomotor. The servomotor turns the load, and through a mechanical linkage called 
RESPONSE, also turns the rotor of the CT. The servomotor turns the rotor of the CT so that it is once 
again in correspondence with the rotor of the CX, the error signal drops to zero volts, and the system

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SYNCHRO-CAPACITORS-1-39-">SYNCHRO CAPACITORS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">As we stated earlier, the speed and accuracy of data transmission are most important. With the use of 
more complex synchros, like the differential and the control transformer, the accuracy of the synchro 
systems may be affected. The following discussion will deal with how complex synchros affect the 
accuracy of synchro systems and what can be done to keep this accuracy as high as possible. Synchro 
capacitors play a major role in maintaining a high degree of accuracy in synchro systems. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When a torque transmitter is connected to a torque receiver (TX-TR), very little, if any, current flows 
in the stators when the rotors are in correspondence. This is because the voltages induced in the TR 
windings almost exactly balance out the voltages induced in the TX windings. As a result, the TR is very 
sensitive to small changes in the position of the TX rotor, causing the TR to follow the TX with a high 
degree of accuracy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When a synchro system contains differential synchros (TDX or CDX), the stator currents at 
correspondence are greater than they are in a single TX-TR system. The reason is the step-up turns ratio 
between the stator and rotor in the differential synchro. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In a synchro system that uses a CT, stator current at correspondence is also greater than in a TX-TR 
system. In this case, however, this reason is that the CT rotor is not energized and as a result no voltage is 
induced in the stator to oppose the voltage in the transmitter stator. The overall effect of this increase in 
stator current is to reduce the accuracy of the system. To maintain high accuracy in a synchro system 
containing either differential units or CTs, the stator currents must be kept to a minimum. This is done by 
connecting synchro capacitors in the circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To understand the operation of a synchro capacitor and how it reduces current drain on the 
transmitter requires a recollection of the voltage and current relationships in inductive and capacitive 
circuits. As you learned in module 2 of this series, current lags voltage by 90º in a purely inductive 
circuit. You also know that an ideal inductor is impossible to make because there is always resistance 
present. Therefore, an inductor has a combination of inductive reactance and resistance. Since current and 
voltage are always in phase in a resistive circuit and 90º out of phase in an inductive circuit, we can say 
that there are two currents in an inductor-the loss current, which is the resistive (in-phase) current, and the 
magnetizing current, which is the inductive (out-of-phase) current. It is this magnetizing current that we 
would like to eliminate in the stator coils of the TDX, CDX, and CT because it makes up most of the line 
current. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Keeping in mind that current leads voltage by 90º in a capacitive circuit, let's see what happens to 
magnetizing current when a capacitor is added to the circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Suppose a capacitor is hooked up across one of the stator coils of a TDX and its capacitance is 
adjusted so that its reactance equals the reactance of the coil. Since the two reactances are equal, the 
current they draw from the line must also be equal. However, these currents are going to be 180º out of 
phase, because the current in the coil lags the line voltage, while the capacitor's current leads it. Since the 
two currents are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, they cancel. The total line current is reduced 
by this effect and, if a capacitor is placed across each coil in the TDX, the line current decreases even 
further. This, in effect, increases torque in synchro systems near the point of correspondence and, 
therefore, increases overall system accuracy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Connecting capacitors across individual stator windings is impractical because it requires that the 
stator winding's common connection be outside the synchro. Since this is not done with synchros, another 
method has been devised to connect up the capacitors which works just as well. This method is shown in 
figure 1-29. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

with three external connections. The entire unit is called a SYNCHRO CAPACITOR. The synchro 
capacitor is made in many sizes to meet the requirements of all sizes of standard differentials and control 
transformers. The synchro capacitor is rated by its total capacity, which is the sum of the individual 
capacities in the unit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-30 shows how a synchro capacitor affects the operation of a control synchro system. In this 
figure, the capacitor is placed between the CX and the CT. Two current meters are also placed in the 
circuit to show the effect the capacitor has on stator current. The meter connected between the capacitor 
and the CT reads normal stator current, 32 milliamperes (mA). This current would normally flow in the 
stator of the CX if the synchro capacitor were not connected. The other meter reads 10 mA, which is what 
is left of the original stator current after the magnetizing current has been canceled by the synchro 
capacitor. By reducing the current drain on the transmitter, the sensitivity and accuracy of the system 
increase.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The data to be transmitted is another important factor that we must consider when we discuss the 
accuracy of a synchro system. If this data covers a wide range of values, the basic synchro system is 
unable to detect any small changes in the data. When this happens, the accuracy of the system decreases. 
Because of this difficulty, multispeed synchro systems were developed. They handle this type of data very 
effectively and still maintain a high degree of accuracy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Multispeed synchro systems use more than one speed of data transmission. The speed of data 
transmission is, simply, the number of times a synchro transmitter rotor must turn to transmit a full range 
of values. For example, a system in which the rotors of synchro devices turn in unison with their input 
and output shafts is commonly called a 1-speed data transmission system. In this system, the transmitter's 
rotor is geared so that 1 revolution of the rotor corresponds to 1 revolution of the input. Until now, the 
discussion of synchro systems has dealt exclusively with this 1-speed system. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In a 36-speed data transmission system, the rotor of the synchro transmitter is geared to turn through 
36 revolutions for 1 revolution of its input. Units transmitting data at one speed are frequently called 1-
speed synchros; a unit transmitting data at 36-speed would be a 36-speed synchro, and so forth. 
</p><p class="paragraph">It is quite common in synchro systems to transmit the same data at two different speeds. For 
example, ship's course information is usually transmitted to other locations on a ship at 1-speed and 36-
speed. A system in which data is transmitted at two different speeds is called a dual- or double-speed 
system. Sometimes a dual-speed system will be referred to by the speeds involved, for example a 1- and 
36-speed system. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In summary, the speed of data transmission is referred to as 1-speed, 2-speed, 36-speed, or some 
other definite numerical ratio. To indicate the number of different speeds at which data is transmitted,

interrupted in a 36-speed system and the transmitter is turned before power is reapplied, the synchros 
could realign themselves in an erroneous position. The number of positions in which the transmitter and

are 35 incorrect positions and only 1 correct position of correspondence.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DUAL-SPEED-SYNCHRO-SYSTEM-1-43-">DUAL-SPEED SYNCHRO SYSTEM 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A basic dual-speed synchro system consists of two transmitters and two receivers, as shown in figure 
1-34. One transmitter receives the external input to the system and, through a network of gears, passes the 
effects of the external input to the second transmitter. The gear ratio between these two transmitters 
determines the two specific speeds the system will use to transmit the input data. The two speeds of this 
system are often referred to as fast and slow, high and low, or more often as fine and coarse. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">If, for example, the gear ratio between the two transmitters is 36 to 1, 1 revolution of the rotor of the 
first transmitter causes 36 revolutions of the rotor of the second transmitter. The first transmitter-the one 
that accepts the external input-can be called the coarse transmitter, and the second one can be called the 
fine transmitter. Representative speeds include 1 and 36, 2 and 36, and 2 and 72. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The output of each transmitter is passed through standard synchro connections to a receiver. One 
receiver receives the coarse signal and the other one receives the fine signal. The two receivers may or 
may not be connected by a network of gears similar to the network between the two transmitters. In some 
dual-speed applications, a double receiver is used instead of two individual receivers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The double receiver (fig. 1-35) consists of a coarse and a fine receiver enclosed in a common 
housing. It has a two-shaft output one inside the other. The coarse and fine receivers may be likened to 
the hour and minute hands of a clock. The coarse receiver corresponds to the hour hand, and the fine </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

be replaced. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

</p><p class="paragraph">In the dual-speed synchro system, data is transmitted by the coarse transmitter, while the system is 
far out of correspondence and then is shifted to the fine transmitter as the system approaches 
correspondence. This shifting from coarse to fine control is done automatically when the fine error signal 
exceeds the coarse error signal. The fine synchro transmitter then drives the system to the point of 
correspondence. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the dual-speed synchro system includes control transformers, there is always the possibility of 
a 180º error being present in the system. The reason is the rotor of the CT is not energized and its error-
voltage output is zero both at its proper position and also at a point 180º away from that position. To 
prevent the CT from locking 180º out of phase with the rest of the system, a low voltage is applied across 
the rotor terminals of the coarse CT as shown in figure 1-36. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the 0º position of the coarse CT To reestablish a new 0º position, the stator of the coarse CT must be 
turned through an angle that induces an opposing 2.5 volts in the rotor to cancel the stickoff voltage. 
Therefore, at 0º the two voltages cancel and no input exists to drive the servo amplifier. Should the rotor 
of the CT stop at 180º, the same 2.5 volts would be induced in the rotor. However, it would be in phase

</h2><p class="paragraph">One of your duties in the Navy is to keep the synchro systems in your equipment in good working 
order. Therefore, it is essential that you become familiar with the details of synchro maintenance and 
repair. 
</p><p class="paragraph">First, let's consider some of the more common problem areas you should avoid when working with 
synchros. As with any piece of electrical or electronic equipment, if it works—leave it alone. Do not 
attempt to zero a synchro system that is already zeroed just because you want to practice. More often than 
not, the system will end up more out of alignment than it was before you attempted to rezero it. Do not 
attempt to take a synchro apart, even if it is defective. A synchro is a piece of precision equipment that 
requires special equipment and techniques for disassembly. Disassembly should be done only by qualified 
technicians in authorized repair shops. A synchro, unlike an electric motor, does not require periodic 
lubrication. Therefore, never attempt to lubricate a synchro. Synchros also require careful handling. Never 
force a synchro into place, never use pliers on the threaded shaft, and never force a gear or dial onto the 
shaft. Finally, never connect equipment that is not related to the synchro system to the primary excitation 
bus. This will cause the system to show all the symptoms of a shorted rotor when the equipment is turned 
on; but, the system will check out good when the equipment is off. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Trouble in a synchro system that has been in operation for some time is usually one of two types. 
First, the interconnecting synchro wiring often passes through a number of switches; at these points 
opens, shorts, or grounds may occur. You will be expected to trace down these troubles with an 
ohmmeter. You can find an open easily by checking for continuity between two points. Similarly, you can 
find a ground by checking the resistance between the suspected point and ground. A reading of zero ohms 
means that the point in question is grounded. Secondly, the synchro itself may become defective, due to 
opens and shorts in the windings, bad bearings, worn slip rings, or dirty brushes. You can do nothing 
about these defects except replace the synchro. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Troubles in new and modified synchro systems are most often because of (1) improper wiring and 
(2) misalignment caused by synchros not being zeroed. You are responsible for finding and correcting 
these troubles. You can check for improper wiring with an ohmmeter by making a point-to-point 
continuity and resistance check. You can correct misalignment of a synchro system by rezeroing the 
entire system. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TROUBLE-INDICATORS-1-55-">TROUBLE INDICATORS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">When trouble occurs in an electronic installation that contains a large number of synchro systems, it 
may be very difficult to isolate the trouble to one particular system. Since it is vital that maintenance 
personnel locate the point of trouble and fix it in as short a time as possible, indicators, which aid in 
locating the trouble quickly, are included in the equipment. These indicators are usually signal lights, 
mounted on a central control board and connected to the different synchro systems. When trouble occurs 
in a synchro system, the signal light connected to it may either light or flash. Maintenance personnel 
identify the defective system by reading the name or number adjacent to the light. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Signal lights indicate either overload conditions or blown fuses. Overload indicators are usually 
placed in the stator circuit of a torque synchro system because the stator circuit gives a better indication of 
mechanical loading than does the current in the rotor circuit. One version of this type of indicator, as 
shown in figure 1-44, consists of a neon lamp connected across the stator leads of a synchro system by 
two transformers. The primaries, consisting of a few turns of heavy wire, are in series with two of the 
stator leads; the secondaries, consisting of many turns of fine wire, are in series with the lamp. The turns 
ratios are designed so that when excess current flows through the stator windings, the neon lamp lights. 
For example, when the difference in rotor positions exceeds about 18º, the lamp lights, indicating that the 
load on the motor shaft is excessive. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Blown fuse indicators are front panel lights which light when a protective fuse in series with the 
rotor blows. Figure 1-45 shows a typical blown fuse indicator. If excessive current flows in the rotor 
windings of this circuit because of a short or severe mechanical overload, one of the fuses will blow and 
the neon lamp across the fuse will light. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Another type of blown fuse indicator uses a small transformer having two identical primaries and a 
secondary connected, as shown in figure 1-46. With both fuses closed, equal currents flow through the 
primaries. This induces mutually canceling voltages in the secondary. If a fuse blows, the induced voltage 
from just one primary is present in the secondary, and the lamp lights.

</h2><p class="paragraph">To help the technician further isolate synchro problems, many manufacturers furnish tables of 
trouble symptoms and probable causes with their equipment. These tables are a valuable aid in isolating 
trouble areas quickly. Tables 1-2 through 1-7 summarize, for a simple TX-TR system, some typical 
trouble symptoms and their probable causes. Keep in mind, if two or more receivers are connected to one 
transmitter, similar symptoms occur. However, if all the receivers act up, the trouble is usually in the 
transmitter or main bus. If the trouble appears in one receiver only, check the unit and its connections. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

voltages as references for faulty operation. Since the proper operation of a system is indicated by specific 
rotor and stator voltages, an ac voltmeter can be used to locate the trouble. When an ac voltmeter is 
connected between any two stator leads, the voltage should vary from 0 to 90 volts (0 to 11.8 volts for 26-
volt systems) as the transmitter rotates. The zero and maximum voltage values should occur at the 
following headings:

the units are close enough to permit checking, the voltage between the R1 and R2 terminal of any unit 
energized by the primary ac source and the corresponding R1 or R2 terminal of any other unit energized 
by the primary ac source should be zero. When the excitation voltage (115 volts or 26 volts) is above or 
below the nominal value, the maximum stator voltages will also be above or below normal.

</p><p class="paragraph">When a transmitter is suspected of being defective, a synchro tester is usually substituted in its place 
to simulate its actions. When the tester is used in this manner, a braking arrangement on the tester applies 
the necessary friction to hold its shaft in different positions so you can determine whether the transmitter 
is good or bad. When using the tester as a transmitter, it is usually a good idea to use only one receiver so 
as not to overload the tester. If the tester is connected in place of a TR or used to check the output of a 
transmitter, the brake is released, allowing the rotor to turn and indicate the transmitter's position. By 
observing the tester's response to the transmitted signal, you can determine if the TR is defective or if the 
transmitter's output is incorrect.

TX and TDX, respectively.

electrical signal applied to its stator, and the mechanical signal applied to its rotor. The output is an 
electrical voltage, which is taken from the rotor winding and used to control some form of power 
amplifying device. The phase and amplitude of the output voltage depend on the angular position of the 
rotor with respect to the magnetic field of the stator.

</h3><p class="paragraph">applications in the operation of electrical and electronic equipment. In working with radar and antennas, 
</p><h3 class="subsection">directors, computing devices, ship's communications, aircraft control, and many other equipments, it is 
</h3><p class="paragraph">often necessary to operate a mechanical load that is remote from its source of control. To obtain smooth, 
</p><p class="paragraph">continuous, and accurate operation, these loads are normally best controlled by synchros. As you already 
</p><p class="paragraph">know, the big problem here is that synchros are not powerful enough to do any great amount of work. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This is where servos come into use. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">A servo system uses a weak control signal to move large loads to a desired position with great

</p><h3 class="subsection">varied applications as moving the rudder and elevators of a model airplane in radio-controlled flight, to

</h3><p class="paragraph">application. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Control systems are broadly classified as either CLOSED-LOOP or OPEN-LOOP. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Closed-loop control systems are the type most commonly used in the Navy because they respond and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">move the loads they are controlling quicker and with greater accuracy than open-loop systems. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The reason for quicker response and greater accuracy is that an automatic feedback system informs 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the input that the desired movement has taken place. Upon receipt of this feedback information, the 
</p><p class="paragraph">system stops the motor, and motion of the load ceases until another movement is ordered by the input. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This is similar to the system that controls heat in many homes. The thermostat (input) calls for heat. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">furnace (output) produces heat and distributes it. Some of the heat is "fed back" to the thermostat. When 
</p><h3 class="subsection">this "feedback" raises the temperature of the room to that of the thermostat setting, the thermostat 
</h3><p class="paragraph">responds by shutting the system down until heat is again required. In such a system, the feedback path, 
</p><p class="paragraph">input to output and back to input, forms what is called a "closed loop." This is a term you will hear and 
</p><p class="paragraph">use often in discussions of control systems. Because closed-loop control systems are automatic in nature, 
</p><p class="paragraph">they are further classified by the function they serve (e.g., controlling the position, the velocity, or the 
</p><p class="paragraph">acceleration of the load being driven). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">An open-loop control system is controlled directly, and only, by an input signal, without the benefit 
</h3><p class="paragraph">of feedback. The basic units of this system are an amplifier and a motor. The amplifier receives a low-
</p><p class="paragraph">level input signal and amplifies it enough to drive the motor to perform the desired job. Open-loop control 
</p><p class="paragraph">systems are not as commonly used as closed-loop control systems because they are less accurate.

</h2><h3 class="subsection">As we stated previously, an open-loop control system is controlled directly, and only, by an input 
</h3><p class="paragraph">signal. The basic units of this type consist only of an amplifier and a motor. The amplifier receives a low-
</p><p class="paragraph">level input signal and amplifies it enough to drive the motor to perform the desired job. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The open-loop control system is shown in basic block diagram form in figure 2-1. With this system, 
</p><p class="paragraph">the input is a signal that is fed to the amplifier. The output of the amplifier is proportional to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">amplitude of the input signal. The phase (ac system) and polarity (dc system) of the input signal 
</p><p class="paragraph">determines the direction that the motor shaft will turn. After amplification, the input signal is fed to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">motor, which moves the output shaft (load) in the direction that corresponds with the input signal. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">motor will not stop driving the output shaft until the input signal is reduced to zero or removed. This 
</p><h3 class="subsection">system usually requires an operator who controls speed and direction of movement of the output by

</p><h3 class="subsection">As you remember, the controlling signal from a CT is relatively weak, too weak to drive an electric

</p><h3 class="subsection">In this application, the tach is used as a feedback device and is designed to produce 1 volt of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">feedback for each 10 rpm. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's assume that the motor is designed to turn 10 rpm for each volt of error signal. Figure 2-7 shows 
</p><p class="paragraph">the tach mechanically connected to the load. With this arrangement, the shaft of the tach rotates as the 
</p><p class="paragraph">load rotates, and the tach can be said to "sense" the speed of rotation of the load. For purposes of 
</p><p class="paragraph">explanation, we win assume that the load is an antenna that we want to rotate at 30 rpm. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Initially, the wiper arm of R1 is set at the 0-volt point (mid-position). This applies 0 volts to the left 
</p><p class="paragraph">side of R 2. Since the motor is not turning, the load is not being driven, and the tach output is 0 volts. This 
</p><p class="paragraph">applies 0 volts to the left side of R 3. Under these conditions, 0 volts is felt at the sum point and the motor 
</p><p class="paragraph">is not driven. The voltage at the sum point is the error signal. When the wiper arm of R1 is moved to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">−9 volt point, an error signal appears at the sum point. At the first instant, the error signal (at the sum 
</p><p class="paragraph">point) is −4.5 volts. This is because, at the first instant, the load and tach have not started to move. With 
</p><p class="paragraph">the tach output at 0 volts, and the wiper of R1 at −9 volts, −4.5 volts is present at the sum point. This 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltage will cause the motor to start to rotate the load. 
</p><p class="paragraph">After a period of time, the load (and tach) are rotating at 10 rpm. This causes the tach to have an 
</p><p class="paragraph">output of +1 volt. With +1 volt from the tach applied to the bottom of R3, and −9 volts (from R1 wiper) 
</p><p class="paragraph">applied to the top of R2, the voltage at the sum point (error signal) is −4 volts. Since the motor will turn 10 
</p><p class="paragraph">rpm for each volt of error signal, the motor continues to speed up. When the load reaches 30 rpm, the tach 
</p><p class="paragraph">output is +3 volts. With this +3 volts at the bottom of R3 and the −9 volts at the top of R 2, the error signal 
</p><p class="paragraph">at the sum point is −3 volts. This −3 volts is the voltage required to drive the motor at 30 rpm, and places 
</p><p class="paragraph">the system in balance. This satisfies the two conditions of the velocity servo. (1) The velocity of the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">output is sensed (by the tach), and (2) an error signal (−3 volts) is still present and the load continues to

</p><p class="paragraph">You may ask why the velocity loop and feedback are necessary. If this motor turns 10 rpm for each 1 
</p><h3 class="subsection">volt error signal, why not simply feed −3 volts into this amplifier from the wiper of R1 and not have a tach

</p><p class="paragraph">The answer is that the velocity loop will regulate the speed of the load for changing conditions. If the

</p><p class="paragraph">The system shown in figure 2-7 is a simplified version of a velocity loop. In practice, the reaction of 
</p><h3 class="subsection">the motor to error voltage and the output of the tach would not be equal (10 rpm per volt and 1 volt per 10

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SERVO-CHARACTERISTICS-2-11-">SERVO CHARACTERISTICS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Servo characteristics vary primarily with the job the servo is designed to do. There are almost as 
</p><p class="paragraph">many types of servos as there are jobs for servos. All servos usually have the common purpose of 
</p><p class="paragraph">controlling output in a way ordered by the input. Ideally, motion and output shaft position should 
</p><p class="paragraph">duplicate the track of the input shaft. However, this ideal performance is never achieved. We will discuss

</p><h3 class="subsection">Because a servo compares an input signal with a feedback response, there will always be a TIME

</p><p class="paragraph">that may exist in the system. Every system has one or more natural oscillating frequencies that depend on 
</p><p class="paragraph">the weight of the load, designed speed, and other characteristics. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The degree of damping is determined by the purpose and the use of the system. If the system is 
</p><p class="paragraph">OVERDAMPED, it will not be bothered by oscillations. However, the large amount of restraint placed on

</p><p class="paragraph">degree of damping. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">An UNDERDAMPED servo system has other traits. The favorable one is its instantaneous response 
</p><p class="paragraph">to an error signal. The unfavorable trait is an erratic operation around the point of synchronization

</p><p class="paragraph">The simplest form of damping is FRICTION damping. Friction damping is the application of friction 
</p><p class="paragraph">to the output shaft or load that is proportional to the output velocity. The amount of friction applied to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">system is critical, and will materially affect the results of the system. Friction absorbs power from the

</p><h3 class="subsection">Friction Clutch Damping 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">The friction clutch damper uses a friction clutch to couple a weighted flywheel to the output drive 
</h3><p class="paragraph">shaft of the servo motor. As the servo motor rotates, the clutch couples some of this motion to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">flywheel. As the flywheel overcomes inertia and gains speed, it approaches the motor speed. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">flywheel, in turning, absorbs energy (power) from the servo motor. The amount of energy stored in the 
</p><p class="paragraph">flywheel is determined by its speed (velocity). Because of inertia, the flywheel resists any attempt to 
</p><p class="paragraph">change its velocity. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">As the correspondence point of the system is approached, the error signal is reduced and the motor 
</h3><p class="paragraph">begins to slow down. In an attempt to keep the output shaft turning at the same speed, the flywheel 
</p><p class="paragraph">releases some of its energy into the shaft. This causes the first overshoot to be large. When the servo 
</p><p class="paragraph">system drives past the point of correspondence, a new error signal is developed. The new error signal is of 
</p><p class="paragraph">opposite polarity and causes the servo system motor to drive in the opposite direction. Once again the 
</p><p class="paragraph">flywheel resists the motor movement and absorbs energy from the system. This causes a large reduction 
</p><p class="paragraph">in the second overshoot and all subsequent overshoots of the system. The overall effect is to dampen the 
</p><p class="paragraph">oscillations about the point of correspondence and reduce the synchronizing time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The motor rotation is transmitted to the flywheel through the friction clutch. The inertia of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">flywheel acts as an additional load on the motor. The friction clutch is designed to slip with a rapid 
</p><p class="paragraph">change of direction or speed. This slipping effectively disconnects the flywheel instantaneously, and thus 
</p><p class="paragraph">governs the amount of power the flywheel draws from the motor. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Magnetic Clutch 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Another type of damper is the MAGNETIC CLUTCH. This type is similar in function to the friction-
</p><p class="paragraph">clutch damper. The main difference between the two is the method used to couple the flywheel to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">shaft of the servo motor. There are two distinct types of magnetic clutch dampers. The first uses a 
</p><p class="paragraph">magnetic field to draw two friction clutch plates together to produce damping. The action is similar to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">friction clutch we just described. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The second version of the magnetic clutch uses the action of a magnetic field generated by two sets 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">of coils, or one set of coils and the induced eddy currents, which result from rotation of the single set of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">coils near a conducting surface (the flywheel). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Coupling in this type of clutch is made by the interaction of two magnetic fields without a physical 
</h3><p class="paragraph">contact between the two. The two-coil or eddy-current type of magnetic clutch offers smoother operation 
</p><p class="paragraph">than a pure friction clutch and has no problem of wear because of friction. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">In summary, a smooth, efficient operating servo system can only be achieved by a system of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">compromises. As you recall, earlier we increased the gain of the amplifier to reduce time lag. This had the 
</p><p class="paragraph">drawback of increasing hunting or oscillations about the point of correspondence. We overcame this 
</p><p class="paragraph">difficulty through friction damping. This solved the problem of hunting and smoothed out servo operation 
</p><p class="paragraph">but acted as part of the servo load. It caused a large first overshoot and increased the time lag. Some form 
</p><h3 class="subsection">of damping that can be used with high amplification to obtain smooth servo operation and minimum time 
</h3><p class="paragraph">lag is needed. The answer lies with the use of ERROR-RATE damping. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-14. Why is damping needed in a practical servo system? </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Error-Rate Damping 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Error-rate damping is a method of damping that "anticipates" the amount of overshoot. This form of 
</p><h3 class="subsection">damping corrects the overshoot by introducing a voltage in the error detector that is proportional to the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">rate of change of the error signal. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">This "correction" voltage is combined with the error signal in the proper ratio to obtain the desired 
</h3><p class="paragraph">servo operation with reduced overshooting and minimum time lag. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The advantages of error-rate damping are as follows: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Maximum damping occurs when a maximum rate of change of error signal is present. This 
</p><p class="paragraph">normally would occur as the servo load reverses direction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Since a CHANGE in the signal causes damping, there is a minimum amount of damping when no 
</p><p class="paragraph">signal, or a signal of constant strength, is present. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Error-rate voltages are generated by either electromechanical devices or electrical networks in the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">equipment. One electromechanical device widely used to generate an error-rate voltage is the tachometer 
</p><p class="paragraph">generator. As you learned previously, its output voltage is proportional to the output velocity of the servo. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Hence, the output voltage of the tachometer can be used to anticipate sudden movement changes of the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">load. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The compensating electrical network used for error-rate damping consists of a combination of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">resistors and capacitors forming an RC, differentiating or integrating network. You should recall that a 
</p><h3 class="subsection">differentiating circuit produces an output voltage that is proportional to the rate of change of the input 
</h3><p class="paragraph">voltage and that an integrating circuit produces an output proportional to the integral of the input signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-9 shows a basic RC INTEGRATOR. It can be recognized by the output voltage being taken 
</p><p class="paragraph">across the capacitor. R 1 is added in this circuit to develop the transient error signal (small variation in the 
</p><p class="paragraph">signal from the error detector). The RC integrator is sometimes referred to as an INTEGRAL CONTROL 
</p><p class="paragraph">CIRCUIT and will be used to explain electrical error-rate damping. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The network consists of a capacitor and two resistors connected in series with the servo amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The components of this circuit are designed to work with a constant or very slowly changing error signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Initially, all of the error voltage is divided between R 1 and R2. But the longer the error voltage is 
</p><p class="paragraph">applied, the more C1 charges, and the greater the voltage at the input of the amplifier. Because of the RC 
</p><p class="paragraph">time of the circuit, it takes time for the capacitor to charge to the value of the error input signal. Because 
</p><p class="paragraph">of the long charge time of C1, the circuit can not respond instantaneously to a rapid change in error signal. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><h3 class="subsection">As you know, servo systems use both ac and dc servo motors depending upon the requirements of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the system. Systems that are required to move light loads at constant speed use ac motors. Systems that 
</p><p class="paragraph">are required to move heavy loads with a wide speed range use dc motors. When the requirements of the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">system call for a dc motor or other dc devices, the ac error signal within the servo system must be 
</h3><p class="paragraph">converted to a dc error signal before being fed to the dc servo amplifier. The conversion is made by the 
</p><p class="paragraph">circuit known as a DEMODULATOR. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">As with the modulator, the demodulator maintains the same relationships between its input and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">output signals. Just like the modulator, the demodulator's output amplitude is proportional to its input 
</p><p class="paragraph">signal and its output polarity is determined by the phase of the input signal. These relationships, as in the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">modulator you just studied, are necessary so the "new" error signal will control the servo motor in the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">desired manner. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Diode Demodulator 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">One example of a servo demodulator is the DIODE DEMODULATOR, sometimes called a phase 
</h3><p class="paragraph">detector, shown in figure 2-18. This circuit is used in servo systems because it not only converts ac to dc, 
</p><p class="paragraph">but it is also able to distinguish the phase of the ac signal by comparing it to a reference voltage. Do not 
</p><h3 class="subsection">confuse this circuit with other phase detector circuits, such as those used in radar or communications 
</h3><p class="paragraph">systems. This demodulator (phase detector) distinguishes signals that are either in phase or 180º out of 
</p><p class="paragraph">phase. For this reason this circuit is useful in servo systems where the ac output from the error detector 
</p><p class="paragraph">(CT) is either in phase with the reference signal or 180º out of phase. Whatever type of error detector is 
</p><h3 class="subsection">used in the servo system, the reference voltage to the error detector and to the demodulator must be IN

</p><p class="paragraph">As shown in figure 2-18, the anodes of the two diodes are supplied with the same reference voltage. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">With no ac error input signal applied to T2 (quiescent state), both diodes will conduct equally on the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">positive half-cycle of the reference voltage. The voltage drops across R11 and R2 are equal. This results in 
</p><h3 class="subsection">the two output terminals being at the same potential; therefore, the output voltage is zero for the positive

</p><p class="paragraph">diodes are cut off, and zero potential is felt across the output terminals. The circuit will remain in this 
</p><p class="paragraph">condition until an ac error signal is applied. As we make this circuit work, you will notice that CR1 will 
</p><h3 class="subsection">conduct when the input signal is in phase with the reference voltage and then only on the positive half-
</h3><p class="paragraph">cycle. CR2 will remain in cutoff unless the phase relationship between the ac error signal and the 
</p><p class="paragraph">reference voltage changes by 180º. At this time CR1 will cut off. This change could be brought about by 
</p><p class="paragraph">the error detector in the servo system sensing a change in the direction of the load. Effectively, we have a 
</p><p class="paragraph">one-diode circuit for one direction of rotation. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Assume that an ac error signal is applied to T2, making the anode of CR1 positive and the anode of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">CR 2 negative. At the same time, the reference voltage on the anodes of CR1 and CR2 is on its positive 
</p><p class="paragraph">half-cycle. Under these conditions, CR1 will conduct and CR2 will be cut off. A positive voltage will be 
</p><p class="paragraph">developed across Ri and felt on the output terminals. During the negative half-cycle, a negative voltage 
</p><p class="paragraph">will be felt on the anodes of CR1, and CR2  and will cut them off. The output of the circuit for one 
</p><p class="paragraph">complete cycle of the reference signal will be a filtered, pulsating, dc voltage. As long as the input and 
</p><p class="paragraph">reference signals are in phase, the circuit acts as a half-wave rectifier and a filter network. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">As we mentioned earlier, this circuit will also respond to a 180º phase reversal between the input and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">reference signals. For instance, when the error signal applied to T2 is 180º out of phase with the reference 
</p><p class="paragraph">signal, CR2 conducts and CR  1 cuts off, causing the output voltage to change polarity. You may encounter 
</p><p class="paragraph">variations of the diode phase detector; however, they all depend on the same basic principle of operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To quickly summarize, the demodulator converted the ac input signal to a dc error signal. The 
</p><h3 class="subsection">polarity of the dc error signal was determined by the phase relationship between the ac error input signal 
</h3><p class="paragraph">and the reference signal. The amplitude of the dc error signal was directly proportional to the magnitude 
</p><p class="paragraph">of the ac input signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-23. What is the purpose of a demodulator in a servo system? 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SERVO-AMPLIFIERS-2-26-">SERVO AMPLIFIERS 
</h2><h3 class="subsection">The servo amplifiers previously discussed were used in servo systems to amplify either the ac or dc 
</h3><p class="paragraph">error signal to a sufficient amplitude to drive the servo motor. These amplifiers are the same amplifiers in 
</p><p class="paragraph">principle as covered in NEETS Module 8, Introduction to Amplifiers. The basic amplifier chosen for use 
in the servo system must have the following characteristics: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Flat gain versus frequency response over the broad band of frequencies of interest. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Minimum phase shift with a change in input signal (zero phase shift is desired, but a small 
</p><p class="paragraph">amount of phase-shift is acceptable, if constant). 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. A low output impedance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. A low noise level. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Up to this point in our discussion of servos, the amplifiers have been directly connected to the motor

</p><h3 class="subsection">example, the signal from the demodulator or filter network may require additional amplification to

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-AC-SERVO-MOTORS-2-27-">AC SERVO MOTORS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Large ac motors are too inefficient for servo use. To move large loads, the ac motor draws excessive 
</p><p class="paragraph">amounts of power, and is difficult to cool. Hence, ac servo motors are used primarily to move light loads. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most of the ac servo motors are of the two-phase or split-phase induction type. Fundamentally, these 
</p><h3 class="subsection">motors are constant-speed devices, although their speeds can be varied within limits by varying the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">amplitude of the voltage to one of the motors stator windings. When the load becomes heavy, the 
</p><p class="paragraph">workhorse dc servo motor is used. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DC-SERVO-MOTORS-2-27-">DC SERVO MOTORS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The control characteristics of dc servo motors are superior to those of ac servo motors. The dc servo 
</p><p class="paragraph">motor can control heavy loads at variable speeds. Most dc servo motors are either the permanent magnet 
</p><p class="paragraph">type, which are used for light loads, or the shunt field type, which are used for heavy loads. The direction 
</p><p class="paragraph">and speed of the dc motor's rotation is determined by the armature current. An increase in armature 
</p><p class="paragraph">current will increase the motor's speed. A reversal of the motor's armature current will change the motor's

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SYNCHRONIZING-CIRCUITS-2-27-">SYNCHRONIZING CIRCUITS 
</h2><h3 class="subsection">As we explained in chapter 1, the use of a multi-speed synchro transmission system increases the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">accuracy of data transmission. The accuracy of the servo system depends in part upon the accuracy of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">input fed from the synchro system. For example, a dual-speed synchro system operating in conjunction 
</p><p class="paragraph">with a servo system uses two CTs (one coarse and one fine) to define a quantity accurately. This is done 
</p><h3 class="subsection">by feeding the output of the COARSE CT to the servo amplifier when the system is far out of 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">correspondence and then shifting to the output of the FINE CT when the system is within 2 or 3 degrees 
</h3><p class="paragraph">of synchronization. A circuit that will perform this job is known as a SYNCHRONIZING NETWORK. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">A synchronizing network (also called a crossover or switching network) senses how far the servo 
</h3><p class="paragraph">load is from the ordered position and then switches either the coarse signal or the fine signal into control. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The signal selected by the circuit is the input to the amplifier. The selection is based on the size of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">error signals the circuit receives. The coarse signal is the predominant factor in the selection, since it is a 
</p><p class="paragraph">measure of the servo's output position throughout its limit of motion. The coarse signal drives the system 
</p><p class="paragraph">into approximate synchronization, and then the fine signal is shifted into control. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Semiconductor-Diode Synchronizing Network 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">The SEMICONDUCTOR-DIODE SYNCHRONIZING NETWORK is fairly common and typical of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the type used in servo systems. Let's take a look at a circuit that uses this technique. Figure 2-19 is an 
</p><p class="paragraph">illustration of the circuit. In the following explanation, we will assume that the system is far out of 
</p><p class="paragraph">correspondence (more than 3º). At this time, the coarse signal is large in amplitute. With this condition, 
</p><p class="paragraph">CR 3 and CR4, or CR5 and CR6, will be forward-biased, depending upon the polarity of the input signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This will cause current to flow through R1. The voltage developed across R1 is felt on one leg of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">summing newtork. A large amplitude fine signal CANNOT be present in the summing network, because 
</p><p class="paragraph">CR1 and CR 2 are designed to limit the fine amplitude to a small value. With this condition present at the 
</p><p class="paragraph">summing network, the coarse signal maintains control and drives the load toward correspondence. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">When the load is within 3º of correspondence, the coarse signal is no longer large enough to forward 
</h3><p class="paragraph">bias the coarse diode network. The effect of this is to cause a large impedance across the diode network, 
</p><p class="paragraph">which then drops most of the coarse signal. Practically no coarse signal voltage is felt across R1 and one 
</p><p class="paragraph">leg of the summing network. On the other hand, the fine signal is also small at this time, since the load is 
</p><p class="paragraph">close to correspondence. Small fine signals are unaffected by CR 1 and CR2. Therefore, the small fine

</p><p class="paragraph">The output of the servo amplifier is connected to one of the motor windings (controlled winding W1). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The other winding (uncontrolled winding W2) is connected across the ac source, in series with a capacitor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The capacitor provides the required 90º phase shift necessary to cause motor rotation. The phase 
</p><h3 class="subsection">relationship of the current through the two windings determines the direction of rotation of the servo

</p><h3 class="subsection">The magnetic amplifier consists of a transformer (T1), and two saturable reactors (L1 and L 2), each 
</h3><p class="paragraph">having three windings. The key point to the operation of this circuit lies in the fact that the error signal 
</p><p class="paragraph">windings are connected in series-opposing while the bias windings are series-aiding. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">With the circuit in the quiescent state (no input), the dc bias voltage causes the dc bias current to 
</h3><p class="paragraph">equally and partially saturate both reactors (L1 and L2). The reactances of L1 and L2 now being equal 
</p><p class="paragraph">result in canceling currents through the W1 windings of the servo motor. With only one input to the

</p><p class="paragraph">Now, let's apply an error signal to the error signal windings. L2 saturates and L1 is driven further out 
</p><p class="paragraph">of partial saturation, because the error windings are in series-opposition. This results in the error signal 
</p><p class="paragraph">aiding the bias current in reactor L 2 and tending to cancel the bias current in reactor L 1. The reactance of 
</p><p class="paragraph">L2 is reduced, causing an increased current through the L2 circuitry. In the other circuit (L1), the reverse is

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-GYROS-3-1-">GYROS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The word gyroscope was first coined by a French scientist, Leon Foucault, in 1852. It is derived 
from the Greek words "gyro," meaning revolution, and "skopien," meaning to view. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The gyroscope, commonly called a GYRO, has existed since the first electron was sent spinning on 
its axis. Electrons spin and show all the characteristics of a gyro; so does the Earth, which spins about its 
polar axis at over 1000 miles per hour at the Equator. The Earth's rotation about its axis provides the 
stabilizing effect that keeps the North Pole pointed within one degree of Polaris (the North Star). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Any rapidly spinning object—a top, a wheel, an airplane propeller, or a spinning projectile—is 
fundamentally a gyroscope. Strictly speaking, however, a gyroscope is a mechanical device containing a 
spinning mass that is universally mounted; that is, mounted so it can assume any position in space. Figure 
3-1 shows a model of a gyro. As you can see, a heavy wheel (rotor) is mounted so that its spin axis is free 
to turn in any direction. The wheel spins about axis X; it can turn about axis Y, and it can turn about axis 
Z. With this mechanical arrangement, the spinning wheel can assume any position in space. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BASIC-PROPERTIES-OF-GYROSCOPES-3-2-">BASIC PROPERTIES OF GYROSCOPES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Gyroscopes have two basic properties: rigidity and precession. Those properties are defined as 
follows: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. RIGIDITY — The axis of rotation (spin axis) of the gyro wheel tends to remain in a fixed 
direction in space if no force is applied to it. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. PRECESSION — The axis of rotation has a tendency to turn at a right angle to the direction of an 
applied force. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The idea of maintaining a fixed direction in space is simple to illustrate. When any object is spinning 
rapidly, it tends to keep its axis pointed always in the same direction. A toy top is a good example. As 
long as the top is spinning fast, it stays balanced on its point. Because of this gyro action, the spinning top 
resists the tendency of gravity to change the direction of its axis. You can think of many more examples. 
A bicycle is easier to balance at high speed than when it is barely moving. At high speed, the bicycle 
wheels act as gyros, and tend to keep their axes (axles) parallel to the ground. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Note that it is easy to move the gyro as long as you keep the axis POINTING in the SAME 
DIRECTION. The gyro resists only those forces that tend to change the direction of its axis. In a bicycle, 
since the axis of rotation (the wheel's axles) is horizontal, the wheels win resist any force that tends to tilt 
or turn them to the right or left. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you can obtain a gyroscope top, you can do some instructive experiments with it. Hold the gyro 
top with its axis vertical as shown in figure 3-2 and start it spinning. As long as it is spinning fast, it will 
stay balanced. You can balance it on a string or on the point of your finger; the axis will stay vertical as 
long as the top is spinning fast. As we mentioned before, this ability of a gyro to keep its axis fixed in 
space is called RIGIDITY. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Now, if you stop the gyro top and turn its axis horizontal, and then start it spinning again, balancing 
one end on a pivot, (fig. 3-3), it won't fall. The top's axis will stay horizontal, resisting the tendency of 
gravity to change its direction Although the gyro will RESIST the force that gravity applies to it, the gyro 
will still RESPOND to that force. The gyro responds by moving its axis at a RIGHT ANGLE to the 
APPLIED FORCE. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The axis will tilt in a direction 90º away from the applied force. This is called PRECESSION. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-4 is another view of the same gyroscope. Its far end is still balanced on the pivot. Gravity is 
pulling down on the gyro. If the gyro rotor is turning in the direction shown by the arrow, the near end of 
the frame (axis) will move to the left. If the rotor were turning in the opposite direction, the frame would 
move to the right. Note that in each of these examples the direction of movement was displaced from the 
applied force (gravity) by 90º. The axis stays horizontal, but the gyroscope responds to the force of 
gravity by rotating around the pivot. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Gyro action may be summarized as follows: A spinning gyro tends to keep its axis pointing in the 
same direction. This is called RIGIDITY. If you apply a force that tends to change the direction of the 
spin axis, the axis will move at a right angle to the direction of the applied force. The direction of 
precession will be 90º clockwise from the applied force if the rotor is spinning clockwise (when viewed 
from the "free" end of the rotor's axis); if the rotor is spinning counterclockwise, the precession will be 
90º counterclockwise. If the axis is horizontal, and you try to tilt it, the axis will turn. If the axis is 
horizontal, and you try to turn it, the axis will tilt. This second characteristic of a gyro is called 
PRECESSION. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of precession, we can control the direction that the spin axis points. This enables us to aim 
the spin axis where we want it to point. Without precession, the rigidity of the gyro would be useless.

the resultant gravitational force on a body such as a gyro would be equivalent to the sum of these separate 
forces. The point at which the resultant force is applied is called the CENTER OF GRAVITY. To have a 
balanced gyro, the center of gravity must be located at the intersection of the three axes of the gyro. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RIGIDITY-3-5-">RIGIDITY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A gyroscope is a spinning body that tends to keep its spin axis rigidly pointed in a fixed direction in 
space. What do we mean by "fixed direction in space"? A fixed direction on Earth is by no means fixed in 
space, because the Earth turns once on its axis every 24 hours, and makes a complete revolution around 
the sun every year. The sun itself is moving through space, taking the Earth and the other planets with it. 
Because of these motions, the expression "fixed direction in space" as used in this explanation is 
theoretical. For all practical purposes, we can say a line from the Earth to a distant star is a fixed direction 
in space. If the spin axis of a spinning gyro is pointed at a distant star, it will remain pointed at the star as 
the Earth turns. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Gyro rigidity is the strength with which a gyro resists any external force that would tilt its rotor spin 
axis. There are three factors that determine gyro rigidity: weight of the rotor, distribution of this weight, 
and rotor speed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The gyro can be considered as an enclosed mechanical system. The energy in the system is equal to 
the input energy. Hence the energy necessary to spin the gyro rotor is contained in the rotor as angular 
momentum, which is a function of rotor weight and the speed of rotor rotation. The heavier the gyro rotor, 
the larger the torque necessary to spin it, and the greater the angular momentum of the rotor. If we have 
two rotors with identical shapes but different weights spinning at the same velocity, the heavier of the two 
will be more rigid in its spin axis since it has the greater angular momentum. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Now let's look at the effect of weight distribution in the rotor of a gyro. Consider three rotors of the 
same weight, as shown in figure 3-6, view (A), view (B), and view (C), with the diameter of one rotor 
half the diameter of the other two. Now, when we spin these rotors at the same speed, we find that the 
rotors with the greater diameter are much more rigid than the one with the smaller diameter. Next, we find 
that we can make the rotors equally rigid by causing the rotor with the smaller diameter to spin faster than 
the larger rotors. Thus rigidity depends both on speed and distribution of weight. The weight of the larger 
rotor being farther away from the axis of spin causes it to be more rigid. This effect is even more 
pronounced if we shape the rotor as shown in view C of figure 3-6. Shifting as much weight as possible to 
the outer rim of the rotor increases rigidity even further.

</h2><p class="paragraph">To provide useful information, a gyro's spin axis must be related to some reference, usually the 
Earth's surface. This is done by using the second fundamental property of a gyro—PRECESSION. The 
gyro is precessed until its spin axis is pointed in the desired direction. So far we have covered precession 
in very general terms. The following paragraphs will cover this "gyro action" in more detail. 
</p><p class="paragraph">We can show precession by using the models in figure 3-7, view (A) and view (B). The gyro wheel 
is mounted so it is free to have its spin axis pointed in any direction. Here the wheel rotates in a flat loop 
called the gyro case (inner gimbal). The gyro case is pivoted in the gimbal ring (outer gimbal) and the 
gyro can swing about the Z axis. The gimbal ring itself turns on pivots that connect it to the fork 
(support). The fork permits the gyro to tilt from side to side about the Y axis.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Regardless of how the fork is placed, the spinning gyro wheel is free to lie in any given plane. That's 
why it is called a free gyroscope in this type of mounting. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To show the effect of precession, we can push down on the gimbal ring at point A at the nearer end 
of the Z-Z axis. (See view A of figure 3-7.) You might expect the ring to tilt around the Y-Y axis. Instead, 
the gyro case will tilt about the Z-Z axis. You can see the effect of this precession in view B. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Here's a rule that applies to all spinning gyros: THE GYRO WILL ALWAYS PRECESS AT RIGHT 
ANGLES TO THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLIED FORCE. Look at view A again. If we keep pushing 
down on the gimbal ring at point (A), the gyro case will keep turning until the spin axis of the gyro wheel 
is horizontal. Then there will be no further precession. At this point the gyro wheel will be spinning in the 
same direction in which the applied force is pushing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Here's another rule: A GYRO ALWAYS PRECESSES IN A DIRECTION TENDING TO LINE 
ITSELF UP SO THAT ITS ROTOR SPINS IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT THE APPLIED 
FORCE IS TRYING TO TURN IT. In other words, the direction of spin chases the applied force. When 
the direction of spin and the applied force are in the same direction, precession stops. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, compare the spin (X) axis in the two parts of figure 3-7. In view A, the spin axis is vertical. In 
view B, the spin axis has moved from the vertical until it is much closer to being horizontal. By applying 
the right amount of force in the right place, we have a method of "aiming" the spin axis so that it points to 
the specific fixed direction in space where we want it. The property of PRECESSION makes the property 
of RIGIDITY useable. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You should understand that most forces, when applied to the gyro mounting, do not cause 
precession. For instance, you can swing the fork around in any direction, and the motion will merely be 
taken up in the Y-Y and Z-Z axes. Similarly, a force applied lengthwise along one of the axes will have 
no effect. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Any force acting through the center of gravity of the gyroscope does not change the angle of the 
plane of rotation but moves the gyroscope as a unit. The position of its spin axis in space is not changed. 
Such forces as those stated above, operating through the center of gravity, are forces of TRANSLATION. 
In other words, the spinning gyroscope may be moved freely in space by means of its supporting frame, </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">without disturbing the plane of rotation of the rotor. This condition exists because the force that is applied 
through the supporting frame, acting through the center of gravity produces no torque on the gyro rotor. 
ONLY THOSE FORCES TENDING TO TILT THE GYRO WHEEL ITSELF WILL CAUSE 
PRECESSION. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's consider further the important characteristic of gyroscopic precession. For a given amount of 
force, the rate of precession of a gyro is governed by the weight, shape, and speed of the rotor. These 
factors are the same as those that determine the rigidity of a gyro. Therefore, there is a definite 
relationship between the rigidity of a gyro and the rate at which a given force will cause it to precess. The 
greater the rigidity of a gyro, the more difficult it is to cause precession, and the less precession there will 
be for a given force. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A gyro will resist any force that attempts to change the direction of its spin axis. However, it will 
move (precess) in response to such force; NOT in the direction of the applied force, but at right angles to 
it. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The direction a gyro will precess also depends on the direction the gyro is spinning. Precession is 
actually the result of two forces: angular momentum (spinning force) and the applied force (torque). The 
direction of precession is always offset from the direction of the applied force. The offset is always in the 
direction of rotor spin. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, when a force is applied upward on the inner gimbal, as shown in figure 3-8, the force 
may be visualized as applied in an arc about axis Y-Y. This applied force is opposed by the resistance of 
gyroscopic inertia, preventing the gyro from rotating about axis Y-Y. With the rotor spinning clockwise, 
the precession will take place 90º clockwise from the point of applied force. The gyro precesses about 
axis Z-Z in the direction of the arrow "P". 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The motions of a gyroscope can be analyzed according to three basic quantities: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. SPIN (the angular velocity of the gyro rotor). 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. TORQUE (the rotary motion applied to change the direction of the rotor axis). </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The above quantities are related to vectors so that the relative directions may be easily compared. 
The SPIN VECTOR lies along the spin axis of the rotor with an arrow indicating the direction of rotation. 
The TORQUE VECTOR represents the axis about which the applied force is felt. The PRECESSION 
VECTOR represents the axis about which precession occurs. In all the above cases the direction of the 
vector is such that the quantity (spin, torque, or precession) is in a clockwise direction if viewed from the 
tail of the vector. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A simple hand rule will help you determine the direction of the SPIN VECTOR. (See fig. 3-9.) 
Curve the fingers of your fight hand in the direction in which the rotor is turning as if you intended to 
grasp the rotor. Your thumb will point in the direction of the spin vector. Similar rules will give you the 
direction of the TORQUE VECTOR and the PRECESSION VECTOR. With the fingers of your right 
hand wrapped in the direction of the applied torque (die direction the gyro would rotate if the rotor were 
not spinning), your thumb points in the direction of the torque vector. Placing your curved fingers in the 
direction of precession will place your thumb pointing in the direction of the precession vector. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">All three motions are rotary (angular) and can be represented by vectors that point in such a direction 
that when you look in the direction of the vector the rotary motion around the vector is clockwise. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another hand rule convenient for determining the DIRECTION OF PRECESSION uses the fingers 
of the right hand. This method may not be new to you. A similar method is applied to electric motors (see 
NEETS, module 5). 
</p><p class="paragraph">You may represent the three vectors listed above by arranging the thumb, forefinger, and middle 
finger of your right hand mutually perpendicular as shown in figure 3-10. Your thumb points in the 
direction of the precession vector, your middle finger points in the direction of the torque vector, and your 
forefinger points in the direction of the spin vector. You can consider these vectors as the axes about 
which angular motion takes place. If you look in the directions your fingers and thumb point, you can 
visualize that all the rotary motions are clockwise as indicated in figure 3-10. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">A gyro can have different degrees of freedom, depending on the number of gimbals in which it is 
supported and the way the gimbals are arranged. Do not confuse the term "degrees of freedom" with an 
angular value such as degrees of a circle. The term, as it applies to gyros, is an indication of the number of 
axes about which the rotor is free to precess. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A gyro mounted in two gimbals has two degrees of freedom. When two gimbals are used, the gyro is 
said to be UNIVERSALLY MOUNTED. This arrangement provides two axes about which the gyro can 
precess. These two axes and the spin axis intersect at the center of gravity of the entire system (excluding 
the support). Because of this arrangement, the force of gravity does not exert a torque to cause precession. 
The rotor, inner gimbal, and outer gimbal are balanced about the three principal axes.

</p><p class="paragraph">In the second group, the gyro's spin axis is either parallel to the surface of the Earth or at some angle 
other than perpendicular. The spin axis of the gyro in the gyrocompass, for example, is maintained in a 
plane parallel to the surface of the Earth It is aligned in a plane of the north-south meridian. Once set, it 
will continue to point north as long as no disturbing force causes it to precess out of the plane of the 
meridian. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Effect of Rotation of the Earth 
</h3><p class="paragraph">As you have learned, a free gyro maintains its spin axis fixed in space, and not fixed relative to the 
Earth's surface. To understand this, imagine yourself in a space ship somewhere out in space and looking 
at the South Pole of the Earth. You see a sphere rotating clockwise, with the South Pole in the center. 
Maneuver your ship until it is on a direct line with the South Pole and then cut in the automatic controls to 
keep it in this position. You will now see the Earth make a complete rotation every 24 hours. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You could keep track of that rotation by driving a big post into the Equator as shown in view A of 
figure 3-11. If this post were upright at 1200, the Earth's rotation would carry it around so it would be 
pointing to your right at 1800. Likewise, the Earth's rotation would carry the post around so that at 2400 it 
would be upside down. Then, at 0600 the next day, the post would be pointing to your left. Finally, at 
1200 the next day the post would be back in its original position, having been carried, with the Earth, 
through its complete rotation. Notice that the post has many positions as you observe it—because it is 
attached to the Earth's surface and does not have rigidity in space. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you put a gyroscope in place of the stake, you will see a different action. Imagine a gyroscope 
mounted at the Equator with its spin axis aligned with the E/W axis of the Earth. The gyro is spinning and 
has rigidity in space. Now look at view B. At 1200 the spinning axis is horizontal with respect to the 
Earth's surface. At 1800 the spinning axis is vertical with respect to the Earth's surface; but the gyro is 
still spinning in the same plane as before, and the black end is pointing away from the Earth's surface. At 
2400, the spinning axis is again horizontal. At 0600 the spinning axis is again vertical, and the black end 
points toward the Earth. Finally, at 1200 the next day, the gyro is in the same position as when it started. 
The plane of spin of the gyro wheel did not change direction in space while the gyro rotated with the 
Earth. This is because the gyro is rigid in space. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">You have just imagined observing the gyro from space. Now, let's come back to Earth and stand 
right next to the gyro. Look at the gyro in view C. From your viewpoint on Earth, the spinning axis 
appears to make one complete rotation in one day. As you know, the gyro is rigid, and both you and the 
Earth are rotating. The effect of the Earth's rotation on a gyro is sometimes called APPARENT DRIFT, 
APPARENT PRECESSION, or APPARENT ROTATION. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Effect of Mechanical Drift 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A directional error in a gyro is produced by random inaccuracies caused by mechanical drift and the 
effect of the Earth's rotation (apparent drift). 
</p><p class="paragraph">We shall see later how it is corrected for in the equipment. First, let's consider the causes of 
mechanical drift. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are three general sources of mechanical drift: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Unbalance. A gyro often becomes dynamically unbalanced when operated at a speed or 
temperature other than that for which it was designed. The static balance of the gyro is upset 
when its center of gravity is not at the intersection of the three major axes. Some unbalance of 
both types will exist in any gyro since manufacturing processes cannot produce a perfectly 
balanced gyro. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Bearing friction. Friction in the gimbal bearings results in loss of energy and incorrect gimbal 
positions. Friction in the rotor bearings causes mechanical drift only if the friction is not 
symmetrical. An even amount of friction all around in a rotor bearing results only in a change of 
the speed of rotation. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

The greater the mass of the gimbal, the greater the drift from this source. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The complete elimination of mechanical drift in gyros appears to be an impossibility. However, by 
proper design it has been kept to a minimum. Any error that still exists can be corrected for.

at 1800? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-15. What are the three causes of mechanical drift in a gyro? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Establishing and Maintaining a Fixed Position 
</h3><p class="paragraph">You now know that a free gyro maintains a fixed position in space. Because of this property, a free 
gyro can be used to establish a stable, unchanging reference, in any plane (horizontal, vertical, or any 
specific position in between). The gyro-erecting system has the function of positioning the gyro to the 
desired position and helping to keep it there. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Any gyro-erecting system must meet the following requirements: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. The system must provide torques (forces) of sufficient magnitude and direction to precess the 
gyro so that its spin axis is brought to the desired position after the rotor is spinning at its 
operating speed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The system must provide torques to precess the gyro back to the required position at the proper 
rate and direction to cancel the effects of apparent and mechanical drift. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Erection may be done mechanically or electrically, depending on the type of power available. 
Specific erection systems are many and varied. We will briefly discuss only two of them. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Mercury Erecting System 
</h3><p class="paragraph">One of the common erection systems used for vertical gyros uses mercury as the element for sensing 
gyro position with respect to vertical. Mercury also provides the force to precess the gyro toward vertical 
when the gyro drifts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This system consists of two tanks of mercury fastened to opposite sides of the gyro case and 
connected by a small mercury tube as shown in figure 3-12. A small air tube is also connected between 
the tanks to prevent a vacuum from forming. If the spin axis tilts away from the vertical, as shown, the 
mercury will flow from one tank to the other. The added weight in the left tank provides a torque which 
causes the gyro to precess. At this point, if you were to apply the rule for precession, you would see that 
the precession would be 90º away from the desired direction. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">To overcome this difficulty, the point where the torque is applied must be moved. The torque point is 
moved by causing the gimbal assembly to slowly and continuously rotate in the proper direction. This is 
done in the following manner. With a small mercury tube, the mercury will take nearly a second to find 
its level. At the same time the mercury is flowing, a small motor is rotating the gimbal supporting the 
gyro about 18 times a minute. Therefore, during the time that it takes the mercury to flow into the low 
tank, the entire gimbal assembly has rotated 90º. The torque will now be applied at a point which causes 
the gyro to precess in the proper direction to maintain the gyro spin axis in a vertical position. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Mercury Ballistic Erecting System 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The erection system used in many horizontal gyros is very similar to the vertical gyro system just 
discussed. It is called the mercury ballistic erection system. The mercury ballistic system has the added 
feature of maintaining the spin axis not only in the horizontal plane, but also with the spin axis aligned 
North-South. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are many different methods of causing free gyros to precess to either the vertical or the 
horizontal plane. All such systems use the forces of gravity to sense variation from the desired position: 
all systems also use the principles of precession to position the gyro property.

</p><p class="paragraph">A rate gyro (sometimes called a rate-of-turn gyro) consists of a spinning rotor mounted in a single 
gimbal, as shown in figure 3-13. A gyro mounted in this manner has one degree of freedom; that is, it is

usually a spring arrangement. This is done to limit precession and to return the rotor to a neutral position 
when there is no angular change taking place. Remember, the amount of precession of a gyro is 
proportional to the force that causes the precession. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">This characteristic of a gyro, when properly used, fits the requirements needed to sense the rate of 
motion about any axis. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-15 shows a method of restraining the precession of a gyro to permit the calculation of an 
angle. Springs have been attached to the crossarm of the output shaft. These springs restrain the free 
precession of the gyro. The gyro may use other types of restraint, but no matter what type of restraint is 
used, the gyro is harnessed to produce some useful work. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the gyro precesses, it exerts a precessional force against the springs that is proportional to the 
momentum of the spinning wheel and the applied force. For example, suppose you rotate the gyro case 
(fig. 3-15) at a speed corresponding to a horizontal force of 2 pounds at F. Obviously, the gyro will 
precess; and as it does, it will cause the crossarm to pull up on spring A with a certain force, say 1 pound. 
(This amount of force would vary with the length of the crossarm.) 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you continue to turn the gyro case at this rate, the precession of the gyro will continually exert a 
pull on the spring. More precisely, the gyro will precess until the 1 pound pull of the crossarm is exactly 
counterbalanced by the tension of the spring; it will remain in a fixed position, as shown in figure 3-15. 
That is, it will remain in the precessed position as long as you continue to rotate the gyro case at the same, 
constant speed. A pointer attached to the output axis could be used with a calibrated scale to measure 
precise angular rates. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When you stop moving the case, you remove the force at F, and the gyro stops precessing. The 
spring is still exerting a pull, however, so it pulls the crossarm back to the neutral position and returns the 
pointer to "zero." 
</p><p class="paragraph">Suppose you now rotate the gyro case at a speed twice as fast as before, and in the same direction. 
This will be equal to a 4-pound force applied at F and a resulting 2-pound pull by the crossarm on spring </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Another type of rate gyro (often used in inertial navigation equipment) is the floated gyro unit. This

that the torsion bar needs no lever arm to exert torque. The torsion bar is mounted along the output axis

in figure 3-19, any acceleration of the auto will cause movement of the mass relative to the auto. The

along the sensitive axis within the case. The movement of the mass is limited by the springs. When the 
case is accelerated, the mass, because of its inertia, tends to remain stationary. This results in a relative 
movement of the mass with respect to the case. When the stretch of the springs overcomes the inertia of 
the mass, the springs cause the mass to stop moving with respect to the case. The displacement of the 
mass with respect to the case is directly proportional to the acceleration of the case. When the case stops 
accelerating, the springs return the mass to its zero position (the reference position). To keep the springs 
from causing the mass to overshoot and oscillate about the reference position, some form of damping is 
needed. This is usually provided by an oil-filled case with vanes for oil to bypass the mass. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

it can be a serious problem because of the errors it may cause in acceleration measurements.  If the unit is 
placed with the sensing axis vertical, the mass will be displaced such that the output is one "G," or one 
unit of gravity. This is done during testing. Then when the sensitive axis is turned so it is horizontal to the 
Earth, the springs center the mass, and the output of the unit is zero.

reset contact of the switch. As acceleration occurs, the tendency of the mass to remain at a constant 
velocity causes the spring to compress. As the spring compresses, it allows the brush to move off the reset 
contact. If the acceleration is great enough, the brush will pass over the switch contacts for acceleration 
levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. These levels are determined by the stiffness of the spring.

coupled to one of four counters. This advances the counter one-half count. The accelerometer is designed 
so that as acceleration decreases, the mass tends to assume the new velocity. The counters will not 
advance the remaining half count until the brush once again touches the reset contact. With this type of

the rotation of the IC transmitter shaft. In view B, the IC transmitter is replaced by a synchro transmitter;
the IC receiver shaft now turns in a direction opposite to that of the synchro transmitter. Voltages that

</p><p class="paragraph">The torque obtainable from either an IC synchro or a standard synchro is determined by the
magnetizing power, which is limited by the allowable temperature rise. When the stator is energized, as in
IC synchros, the magnetizing power can be increased with a resulting larger torque. The reason for this is
that the losses are dissipated in the form of heat around the outer shell of the IC transmitter or receiver. In
standard synchros, this heat loss is dissipated through the rotor, the air gap, and then the outer shell to the
surrounding air.

stator as shown in figure 4-1. To zero an IC synchro, apply the same general theory as we described for
other synchros.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">All of the synchro units we have discussed operate on alternating current. In applications where
alternating current is not available, there is a need for a system that can use direct current. The STEP-
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM (sometimes referred to as the step-by-step system) is such a system.
</p><p class="paragraph">A geared step-transmission system is often used to drive compass repeaters on naval vessels and
merchant ships having dc power.
</p><p class="paragraph">Although many variations are used, the simplified step-by-step transmission system shown in figure
4-3 is typical. In this system, a step transmitter and a step motor are used together to transmit angular data
(information) between remote locations. When rotated, the shaft of the step transmitter periodically
switches a dc excitation voltage from one pair of coils to another in the step motor. The step motor, which
is the receiver in the system, responds to this varying excitation by rotating an amount that is proportional
to the transmitter’s shaft position.
</p><p class="paragraph">The stator of this step motor has six field coils spaced 60 degrees apart. The coils are connected in
three groups of two coils each, with opposite coils connected in series. One end of each pair of coils is
connected to one of the brushes in the step transmitter. The other ends of the coils are connected to the
other side of the dc supply voltage through a common lead. As the rotor of the step transmitter is turned,
the corresponding coils in the step motor are energized in sequence, producing a rotating step-by-step
stator field. Thus, the motor rotates in abrupt increments or steps rather than smoothly.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

(chapter 1, fig. 1-10).
</p><p class="paragraph">For ease of explanation, we will replace the step transmitter with a battery as we discuss the
operation of the step motor. If, as shown in view A of figure 4-4, we apply the dc battery voltage across
the number 1 coils only, the armature will turn to the position shown. When we apply the voltage also to
the number 2 coils, the armature turns to a position midway between the number 1 and number 2 coils,

</p><p class="paragraph">In actual operation, the step-by-step motor is driven by a step transmitter (rotary switch) as shown in
figure 4-3. As the switch is rotated, it applies voltage first to coil 1, and then in sequence to 1 and 2
together, coil 2 only, coils 2 and 3 together, coil 3 only, and so on, until the complete revolution is made.
As a result, the armature turns in 30-degree steps that follow the rotation of the rotary switch. The rotating
arm of the switch can be turned mechanically to angles between zero and 360º in 30-degree steps. The
actual angle through which the arm is rotated depends on the specific data to be transmitted by the
system. Real systems may transmit data in greater or lesser steps than 30 degrees, depending on system
design.
</p><p class="paragraph">An important point in this type of system is that because the armature is soft iron, either end of the
armature may turn and line up with the energized coils. For this reason, a hand reset control is provided
on the step-by-step motor. This permits an operator to align the receiver with the transmitter each time the
power supply is energized.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The last device we will discuss is the resolver. Physically, resolvers are similar to synchros, and are
used to perform mathematical computations electrically. They are rotary electromechanical devices that
provide outputs that are trigonometric functions of their inputs. As you may know, the branch of
mathematics that deals with the quantities and angles of a right triangle is known as trigonometry. Many
"trig" problems that can be solved with paper and pencil can be solved by applying the proper electrical or
mechanical quantities to a resolver. The resolver has the advantage of giving instantaneous solutions if the
input quantities are changing continuously.
</p><p class="paragraph">Resolvers are classified according to size (diameter) in the same manner as standard synchros and
may be mounted with most standard synchro mounting hardware. A cutaway view of a resolver is shown
in figure 4-5.
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that the stator of the resolver is a cylindrical structure of slotted laminations on which two
coils are wound. The rotor is composed of a shaft, laminations, two windings, and four slip rings.
Compensator components, which improve the angular accuracy of resolvers, may consist of resistors or
additional windings in the stator and rotor winding circuits. Compensator windings, which increase the
accuracy of the resolver, are located inside the stator. Compensating (calibrating) resistors, which</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

resolver housing.
</p><p class="paragraph">A cylindrical frame with a standardized mounting flange houses the assembled resolver. External
and internal connections can be made to an insulated terminal board on the rear of the housing. Miniature
resolvers often have lead wires brought out through the rear of the resolver, eliminating the need for a
terminal block. A reference line is scribed on the face of the housing for alignment with a similar line on
the end of the rotor shaft. These are used in determining coarse electrical zero.
</p><p class="paragraph">Basically, a resolver is a transformer in which the secondary windings can be rotated with respect to
the primary windings. Consequently, the amount of magnetic coupling between the primary and the
secondary is variable. In the most common form, a resolver consists of a stator and a rotor, each having
two separate windings placed precisely at right angles to each other as shown in figure 4-6.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the two stator windings are physically and electrically at right angles to each other, there is no
magnetic coupling between them. The stator windings are mounted on the resolver housing and are
stationary with respect to it.
</p><p class="paragraph">Similarly, the rotor windings of the resolver are wound at right angles to each other. Hence, there is
no magnetic coupling between the two windings. The rotor windings are mounted on the rotor shaft and
turn with it. The rotor is capable of unlimited rotation. Thus, the rotor windings can be set at any angle
with respect to the stator windings.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of the 90º physical and electrical relationships, the resolver has the ability to separate a
quantity into its two right-angle components. This is called RESOLUTION.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-7 illustrates the use of a resolver in solving a resolution problem. Assume that a voltage, E,
and an angle, R, represent the magnitude and direction of a known quantity. To determine the two right-
angle components of the quantity, feed the magnitude of the quantity to one stator coil and physically turn
the rotor through angle R. The input voltage (E) induces voltage E1 and E2 in the two rotor coils. The
values of these rotor voltages represent the vertical and horizontal components of the known quantity and
depend on both the value of E and the angle (R) through which the rotor was turned.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

produce the resultant vector (hypotenuse) at the resultant angle. This is called COMPOSITION.

two known quantities, vertical and horizontal components, that are represented by E1 and E2,
respectively. Each of these is fed to a stator coil. These two voltages induce a voltage, ET, in one of the
rotor coils. ET represents a voltage that is proportional to the hypotenuse. The voltage induced in the
other rotor coils is fed to a closed-loop servo, which positions the rotor shaft to the angle (direction) of the
hypotenuse.

naval problems solved by resolvers involve distances, speeds, angular quantities, etc.
