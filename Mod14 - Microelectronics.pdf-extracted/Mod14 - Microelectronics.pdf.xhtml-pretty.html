</h2><p class="paragraph">In NEETS, Module 6, Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies, you learned 
that Thomas Edison's discovery of thermionic emission opened the door to electronic technology. 
Progress was slow in the beginning, but each year brought new and more amazing discoveries. The 
development of vacuum tubes soon led to the simple radio. Then came more complex systems of 
communications. Modern systems now allow us to communicate with other parts of the world via 
satellite. Data is now collected from space by probes without the presence of man because of 
microelectronic technology. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Sophisticated control systems allow us to operate equipment by remote control in hazardous 
situations, such as the handling of radioactive materials. We can remotely pilot aircraft from takeoff to 
landing. We can make course corrections to spacecraft millions of miles from Earth. Space flight, 
computers, and even video games would not be possible except for the advances made in 
microelectronics. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The most significant step in modern electronics was the development of the transistor by Bell 
Laboratories in 1948. This development was to solid-state electronics what the Edison Effect was to the 
vacuum tube. The solid-state diode and the transistor opened the door to microelectronics. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MICROELECTRONICS is defined as that area of technology associated with and applied to the 
realization of electronic systems made of extremely small electronic parts or elements. As discussed in 
topic 2 of NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, the term 
microelectronics is normally associated with integrated circuits (IC). Microelectronics is often thought to 
include only integrated circuits. However, many other types of circuits also fall into the microelectronics 
category. These will be discussed in greater detail under solid-state devices later in this topic. 
</p><p class="paragraph">During World War II, the need to reduce the size, weight, and power of military electronic systems 
became important because of the increased use of these systems. As systems became more complex, their 
size, weight, and power requirements rapidly increased. The increases finally reached a point that was 
unacceptable, especially in aircraft and for infantry personnel who carried equipment in combat. These 
unacceptable factors were the driving force in the development of smaller, lighter, and more efficient 
electronic circuit components. Such requirements continue to be important factors in the development of 
new systems, both for military and commercial markets. Military electronic systems, for example, 
continue to become more highly developed as their capability, reliability, and maintainability is increased. 
Progress in the development of military systems and steady advances in technology point to an ever-
increasing need for increased technical knowledge of microelectronics in your Navy job.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The earliest electronic circuits were fairly simple. They were composed of a few tubes, transformers, 
resistors, capacitors, and wiring. As more was learned by designers, they began to increase both the size 
and complexity of circuits. Component limitations were soon identified as this technology developed. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Vacuum tubes were found to have several built-in problems. Although the tubes were lightweight, 
associated components and chassis were quite heavy. It was not uncommon for such chassis to weigh 40 
to 50 pounds. In addition, the tubes generated a lot of heat, required a warm-up time from 1 to 2 minutes, 
and required hefty power supply voltages of 300 volts dc and more. 
</p><p class="paragraph">No two tubes of the same type were exactly alike in output characteristics. Therefore, designers were 
required to produce circuits that could work with any tube of a particular type. This meant that additional 
components were often required to tune the circuit to the output characteristics required for the tube used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-1 shows a typical vacuum-tube chassis. The actual size of the transformer is approximately 
4 × 4 × 3 inches. Capacitors are approximately 1 × 3 inches. The components in the figure are very large 
when compared to modern microelectronics. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A circuit could be designed either as a complete system or as a functional part of a larger system. In 
complex systems, such as radar, many separate circuits were needed to accomplish the desired tasks. 
Multiple-function tubes, such as dual diodes, dual triodes, tetrodes, and others helped considerably to 
reduce the size of circuits. However, weight, heat, and power consumption continued to be problems that 
plagued designers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another major problem with vacuum-tube circuits was the method of wiring components referred to 
as POINT-TO-POINT WIRING.  Figure 1-2 is an excellent example of point-to-point wiring. Not only 
did this wiring look like a rat's nest, but it often caused unwanted interactions between components. For 
example, it was not at all unusual to have inductive or capacitive effects between wires. Also, point-to-
point wiring posed a safety hazard when troubleshooting was performed on energized circuits because of 
exposed wiring and test points. Point-to-point wiring was usually repaired with general purpose test 
equipment and common hand tools. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Vacuum-tube circuits proved to be reliable under many conditions. Still, the drawbacks of large size, 
heavy weight, and significant power consumption made them undesirable in most situations. For 
example, computer systems using tubes were extremely large and difficult to maintain. ENIAC, a 
completely electronic computer built in 1945, contained 18,000 tubes. It often required a full day just to 
locate and replace faulty tubes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In some applications, we are still limited to vacuum tubes. Cathode-ray tubes used in radar, 
television, and oscilloscopes do not, as yet, have solid-state counterparts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One concept that eased the technician's job was that of MODULAR PACKAGING. Instead of 
building a system on one large chassis, it was built of MODULES or blocks. Each module performed a 
necessary function of the system. Modules could easily be removed and replaced during troubleshooting 
and repair. For instance, a faulty power supply could be exchanged with a good one to keep the system 
operational. The faulty unit could then be repaired while out of the system. This is an example of how the 
module concept improved the efficiency of electronic systems. Even with these advantages, vacuum tube 
modules still had faults. Tubes and point-to-point wiring were still used and excessive size, weight, and 
power consumption remained as problems to be overcome. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Vacuum tubes were the basis for electronic technology for many years and some are still with us. 
Still, emphasis in vacuum-tube technology is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. The emphasis of 
technology is in the field of microelectronics.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Now would be a good time for you to review the first few pages of NEETS, Module 7, Introduction 
to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, as a refresher for solid-state devices. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The transition from vacuum tubes to solid-state devices took place rapidly. As new types of 
transistors and diodes were created, they were adapted to circuits. The reductions in size, weight, and 
power use were impressive. Circuits that earlier weighed as much as 50 pounds were reduced in weight to 
just a few ounces by replacing bulky components with the much lighter solid-state devices. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The earliest solid-state circuits still relied on point-to-point wiring which caused many of the 
disadvantages mentioned earlier. A metal chassis, similar to the type used with tubes, was required to 
provide physical support for the components. The solid-state chassis was still considerably smaller and 
lighter than the older, tube chassis. Still greater improvements in component mounting methods were yet 
to come. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the most significant developments in circuit packaging has been the PRINTED CIRCUIT 
BOARD (pcb), as shown in figure 1-3. The pcb is usually an epoxy board on which the circuit leads have 
been added by the PHOTOETCHING process. This process is similar to photography in that copper-clad 
boards are exposed to controlled light in the desired circuit pattern and then etched to remove the 
unwanted copper. This process leaves copper strips (LANDS) that are used to connect the components. In 
general, printed circuit boards eliminate both the heavy, metal chassis and the point-to-point wiring. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Although printed circuit boards represent a major improvement over tube technology, they are not 
without fault. For example, the number of components on each board is limited by the sizes and shapes of 
components. Also, while vacuum tubes are easily removed for testing or replacement, pcb components 
are soldered into place and are not as easily removed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Normally, each pcb contains a single circuit or a subassembly of a system. All printed circuit boards 
within the system are routinely interconnected through CABLING HARNESSES (groups of wiring or 
ribbons of wiring). You may be confronted with problems in faulty harness connections that affect system 
reliability. Such problems are often caused by wiring errors, because of the large numbers of wires in a 
harness, and by damage to those wires and connectors. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the CORDWOOD MODULE, shown in figure 1-4. You can see that the components are placed 
perpendicular to the end plates. The components are packed very closely together, appearing to be stacked 
like cordwood for a fireplace. The end plates are usually small printed circuit boards, but may be 
insulators and solid wire, as shown in the figure. Cordwood modules may or may not be 
ENCAPSULATED (totally imbedded in solid material) but in either case they are difficult to repair.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Many advertisements for electronic equipment refer to integrated circuits or solid-state technology. 
You know the meaning of the term solid-state, but what is an INTEGRATED CIRCUIT? The accepted 
Navy definition for an integrated circuit is that it consists of elements inseparably associated and formed 
on or within a single SUBSTRATE (mounting surface). In other words, the circuit components and all 
interconnections are formed as a unit. You will be concerned with three types of integrated circuits: 
MONOLITHIC, FILM, and HYBRID. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MONOLITHIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS are those that are formed completely within a 
semiconductor substrate. These integrated circuits are commonly referred to as SILICON CHIPS. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">FILM INTEGRATED CIRCUITS are broken down into two categories, THIN FILM and THICK 
FILM. Film components are made of either conductive or nonconductive material that is deposited in 
desired patterns on a ceramic or glass substrate. Film can only be used as passive circuit components, 
such as resistors and capacitors. Transistors and/or diodes are added to the substrate to complete the 
circuit. Differences in thin and thick film will be discussed later in this topic. 
</p><p class="paragraph">HYBRID INTEGRATED CIRCUITS combine two or more integrated circuit types or combine one 
or more integrated circuit types and DISCRETE (separate) components. Figure 1-5 is an example of a 
hybrid integrated circuit consisting of silicon chips and film circuitry. The two small squares are chips 
and the irregularly shaped gray areas are film components.

combinations of these. Such circuits are applied in DIGITAL, SWITCHING, and LINEAR (analog) 
circuits. Because of the current trend of producing a number of circuits on a single chip, you may look for 
further increases in the packaging density of electronic circuits. At the same time you may expect a 
reduction in the size, weight, and number of connections in individual systems. Improvements in 
reliability and system capability are also to be expected. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Thus, even as existing capabilities are being improved, new areas of microelectronic use are being 
explored. To predict where all this use of technology will lead is impossible. However, as the demand for

</p><p class="paragraph">Development of a microelectronic device begins with a demand from industry or as the result of 
research. A device that is needed by industry may be a simple diode network or a complex circuit 
consisting of thousands of components. No matter how complex the device, the basic steps of production 
are similar. Each type of device requires circuit design, component arrangement, preparation of a 
substrate, and the depositing of proper materials on the substrate. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The first consideration in the development of a new device is to determine what the device is to 
accomplish. Once this has been decided, engineers can design the device. During the design phase, the 
engineers will determine the numbers and types of components and the interconnections, needed to 
complete the planned circuit. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMPONENT-ARRANGEMENT-1-9-">COMPONENT ARRANGEMENT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Planning the component arrangement for a microelectronic device is a very critical phase of 
production. Care must be taken to ensure the most efficient use of space available. With simple devices, 
this can be accomplished by hand. In other words, the engineers can prepare drawings of component 
placement. However, a computer is used to prepare the layout for complex devices. The computer is able 
to store the characteristics of thousands of components and can provide a printout of the most efficient 
component placement. Component placement is then transferred to extremely large drawings. During this 
step, care is taken to maintain the patterns as they will appear on the substrate. Figure 1-7 shows a fairly 
simple IC MASK PATTERN. If this pattern were being prepared for production, it would be drawn 
several hundred times the size shown and then photographed. The photo would then be reduced in size 
until it was the actual desired size. At that time, the pattern would be used to produce several hundred 
patterns that would be used on one substrate. Figure 1-8 illustrates how the patterns would be distributed 
to act as a WAFER MASK for manufacturing.

</h2><p class="paragraph">As was mentioned earlier in this topic, microelectronic devices are produced on a substrate. This 
substrate will be of either insulator or semiconductor material, depending on the type of device. Film and 
hybrid ICs are normally constructed on a glass or ceramic substrate. Ceramic is usually the preferred 
material because of its durability. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Substrates used in monolithic ICs are of semiconductor material, usually silicon. In this type of IC, 
the substrate can be an active part of the IC. Glass or ceramic substrates are used only to provide support 
for the components. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor substrates are produced by ARTIFICIALLY GROWING cylindrical CRYSTALS of 
pure silicon or germanium. Crystals are "grown" on a SEED CRYSTAL from molten material by slowly 
lifting and cooling the material repeatedly. This process takes place under rigidly controlled atmospheric 
and temperature conditions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-9 shows a typical CRYSTAL FURNACE. The seed crystal is lowered until it comes in 
contact with the molten material-silicon in this case. It is then rotated and raised very slowly. The seed 
crystal is at a lower temperature than the molten material. When the molten material is in contact with the 
seed, it solidifies around the seed as the seed is lifted. This process continues until the grown crystal is of 
the desired length. A typical crystal is about 2 inches in diameter and 10 to 12 inches long. Larger 
diameter crystals can be grown to meet the needs of the industry. The purity of the material is strictly 
controlled to maintain specific semiconductor properties. Depending on the need, n or p impurities are 
added to produce the desired characteristics. Several other methods of growing crystals exist, but the 
basic concept of crystal production is the same. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FABRICATION-OF-IC-DEVICES-1-12-">FABRICATION OF IC DEVICES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Fabrication of monolithic ICs is the most complex aspect of microelectronic devices we will discuss. 
Therefore, in this introductory module, we will try to simplify this process as much as possible. Even 
though the discussion is very basic, the intent is still to increase your appreciation of the progress in 
microelectronics. You should, as a result of this discussion, come to realize that advances in 
manufacturing techniques are so rapid that staying abreast of them is extremely difficult. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Monolithic Fabrication. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Two types of monolithic fabrication will be discussed. These are the DIFFUSION METHOD and the 
EPITAXIAL METHOD. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DIFFUSION METHOD.—The DIFFUSION process begins with the highly polished silicon wafer 
being placed in an oven (figure 1-11). The oven contains a concentration impurity made up of impurity 
atoms which yield the desired electrical characteristics. The concentration of impurity atoms is diffused 
into the wafer and is controlled by controlling the temperature of the oven and the time that the silicon 
wafer is allowed to remain in the oven. This is called DOPING. When the wafer has been uniformly 
doped, the fabrication of semiconductor devices may begin. Several hundred circuits are produced 
simultaneously on the wafer. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The steps in the fabrication process described here, and illustrated in figure 1-12, would produce an 
npn, planar-diffused transistor. But, with slight variations, the technique may also be applied to the 
production of a complete circuit, including diodes, resistors, and capacitors. The steps are performed in 
the following order: </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">1. An oxide coating is thermally grown over the n-type silicon starting material. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. By means of the photolithographic process, a window is opened through the oxide layer. This is 
done through the use of masks, as discussed earlier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. The base of the transistor is formed by placing the wafer in a diffusion furnace containing a p-
type impurity, such as boron. By controlling  the temperature of the oven and the length of time 
that the wafer is in the oven, you can control the amount of boron diffused through the window 
(the boron will actually spread slightly beyond the window opening). A new oxide layer is then 
allowed to form over the area exposed by the window. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. A new window, using a different mask much smaller than the first, is opened through the new 
oxide layer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. An n-type impurity, such as phosphorous, is diffused through the new window to form the 
emitter portion of the transistor. Again, the diffused material will spread slightly beyond the 
window opening. Still another oxide layer is then allowed to form over the window. 
</p><p class="paragraph">6. By means of precision-masking techniques, very small windows (about 0.005 inch in diameter) 
are opened in both the base and emitter regions of the transistor to provide access for electrical 
currents. 
</p><p class="paragraph">7. Aluminum is then deposited in these windows and alloyed to form the leads of the transistor or 
the IC.

prevents contamination.)

</p><p class="paragraph">EPITAXIAL METHOD.—The EPITAXIAL process involves depositing a very thin layer of 
silicon to form a uniformly doped crystalline region (epitaxial layer) on the substrate. Components are 
produced by diffusing appropriate materials into the epitaxial layer in the same way as the planar-
diffusion method. When planar-diffusion and epitaxial techniques are combined, the component 
characteristics are improved because of the uniformity of doping in the epitaxial layer. A cross section of 
a typical planar-epitaxial transistor is shown in figure 1-13. Note that the component parts do not 
penetrate the substrate as they did in the planar-diffused transistor. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">ISOLATION.—Because of the closeness of components in ICs, ISOLATION from each other 
becomes a very important factor. Isolation is the prevention of unwanted interaction or leakage between 
components. This leakage could cause improper operation of a circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Techniques are being developed to improve isolation. The most prominent is the use of silicon oxide, 
which is an excellent insulator. Some manufacturers are experimenting with single-crystal silicon grown 
on an insulating substrate. Other processes are also used which are far too complex to go into here. With 
progress in isolation techniques, the reliability and efficiency of ICs will increase rapidly. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Thin Film 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Thin film is the term used to describe a technique for depositing passive circuit elements on an 
insulating substrate with coating to a thickness of 0.0001 centimeter. Many methods of thin-film 
deposition exist, but two of the most widely used are VACUUM EVAPORATION and CATHODE 
SPUTTERING. 
</p><p class="paragraph">VACUUM EVAPORATION.—Vacuum evaporation is a method used to deposit many types of 
materials in a highly evacuated chamber in which the material is heated by electricity, as shown in figure 
1-14. The material is radiated in straight lines in all directions from the source and is shadowed by any 
objects in its path. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The wafers, with appropriate masks (figure 1-15), are placed above and at some distance from the 
material being evaporated. When the process is completed, the vacuum is released and the masks are 
removed from the wafers. This process leaves a thin, uniform film of the deposition material on all parts 
of the wafers exposed by the open portions of the mask. This process is also used to deposit 
interconnections (leads) between components of an IC.

</p><p class="paragraph">The vacuum evaporation technique is most suitable for deposition of highly reactive materials, such 
as aluminum, that are difficult to work with in air. The method is clean and allows a better contact 
between the layer of deposited material and the surface upon which it has been deposited. In addition, 
because evaporation beams travel in straight lines, very precise patterns may be produced. 
</p><p class="paragraph">CATHODE-SPUTTERING.—A typical cathode-sputtering system is illustrated in figure 1-16. 
This process is also performed in a vacuum. A potential of 2 to 5 kilovolts is applied between the anode 
and cathode (source material). This produces a GLOW DISCHARGE in the space between the electrodes. 
The rate at which atoms are SPUTTERED off the source material depends on the number of ions that 
strike it and the number of atoms ejected for each ion bombardment. The ejected atoms are deposited 
uniformly over all objects within the chamber. When the sputtering cycle is completed, the vacuum in the 
chamber is released and the wafers are removed. The masks are then removed from the wafers, leaving a 
deposit that forms the passive elements of the circuit, as shown in figure 1-17.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Finely polished glass, glazed ceramic, and oxidized silicon have been used as substrate materials for 
thin films. A number of materials, including nichrome, a compound of silicon oxide and chromium 
cermets, tantalum, and titanium, have been used for thin-film resistors. Nichrome is the most widely used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The process for producing thin-film capacitors involves deposition of a bottom electrode, a 
dielectric, and finally a top electrode. The most commonly used dielectric materials are silicon monoxide 
and silicon dioxide. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Thick Film 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Thick films are produced by screening patterns of conducting and insulating materials on ceramic 
substrates. A thick film is a film of material with a thickness that is at least 10 times greater than the mean 
free path of an electron in that material, or approximately 0.001 centimeter. The technique is used to 
produce only passive elements, such as resistors and capacitors. 
</p><p class="paragraph">PROCEDURES.—One procedure used in fabricating a thick film is to produce a series of stencils 
called SCREENS. The screens are placed on the substrate and appropriate conducting or insulating 
materials are wiped across the screen. Once the conducting or insulating material has been applied, the 
screens are removed and the formulations are fired at temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius. This 
process forms alloys that are permanently bonded to the insulating substrate. To a limited extent, the 
characteristics of the film can be controlled by the firing temperature and length of firing time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RESISTORS.—Thick-film resistance values can be held to a tolerance of ±10 percent. Closer 
tolerances are obtained by trimming each resistor after fabrication. Hundreds of different cermet 
formulations are used to produce a wide range of component parameters. For example, the material used 
for a 10-ohm-per-square resistor is quite different from that used for a 100-kilohm-per-square resistor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">CAPACITORS AND RESISTOR-CAPACITOR NETWORKS.—Capacitors are formed by a 
sequence of screenings and firings. Capacitors in this case consist of a bottom plate, intraconnections, a 
dielectric, and a top plate. For resistor-capacitor networks, the next step would be to deposit the resistor 
material through the screen. The final step is screening and firing of a glass enclosure to seal the unit. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">A hybrid microcircuit is one that is fabricated by combining two or more circuit types, such as film 
and semiconductor circuits, or a combination of one or more circuit types and discrete elements. The 
primary advantage of hybrid microcircuits is design flexibility; that is, hybrid microcircuits can be 
designed to provide wide use in specialized applications, such as low-volume and high-frequency circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Several elements and circuits are available for hybrid applications. These include discrete 
components that are electrically and mechanically compatible with ICs. Such components may be used to 
perform functions that are supplementary to those of ICs. They can be handled, tested, and assembled 
with essentially the same technology and tools. A hybrid IC showing an enlarged chip is shown in figure 
1-18.

The circuits are usually sealed in a package to protect them from mechanical and environmental stresses.

could result from moisture, dirt, heat, radiation, or other sources. The housing protects the device and aids 
in its handling and connection into the system in which the IC is used. The three most common types of 
packages are the modified TRANSISTOR-OUTLINE (TO) PACKAGE, the FLAT PACK, and the 
DUAL INLINE PACKAGE (DIP).

applications. Figure 1-19 is an exploded view of a TO-5 package. Once the IC has been attached to the

conductive patterns are evaporated inside the package before the die is attached. These patterns connect

</p><p class="paragraph">You should recall from NEETS, Module 13, Introduction to Number Systems, Boolean Algebra, and 
Logic Circuits, that a basic flip-flop is a device having two stable states and two input terminals (or types 
of input signals), each of which corresponds to one of the two states. The flip-flop remains in one state 
until caused to change to the other state by application of an input voltage pulse. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A J-K flip-flop differs from the basic flip-flop because it has a third input terminal. A clock pulse, or 
trigger, is usually applied to this input to ensure proper timing in the circuit. An input signal must occur at 
the same time as the clock pulse to change the state of the flip-flop. The conventional J-K flip-flop circuit 
in figure 1-28 requires approximately 40 discrete components, 200 connections, and 300 processing 
operations. Each of these 300 operations (seals and connections) represents a possible source of failure. If 
all the elements of this circuit are integrated into one chip of silicon, the number of connections drops to 
approximately 14. This is because all circuit elements are intraconnected inside the package and the 300 
processing operations are reduced to approximately 30. Figure 1-29 represents a size comparison of a 
discrete J-K circuit and an integrated circuit of the same type.

knowledge of the field. You can imagine how much trouble you would have remembering 10 or more 
different names and definitions for a resistor. If standardization didn't exist for the new terminology, you 
would have far more trouble understanding microelectronics. To standardize terminology in 
microelectronics, the Navy has adopted several definitions with which you should become familiar. These 
definitions will be presented in this section.

extremely small electronic parts or elements. Most of today's computers, weapons systems, navigation

</p><h3 class="subsection">Microcircuit 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A microcircuit is not what the old-time technician would recognize as an electronic circuit. The old-
timer would no longer see the familiar discrete parts (individual resistors, capacitors, inductors, 
transistors, and so forth). Microelectronic circuits, as discussed earlier, are complete circuits mounted on a 
substrate (integrated circuit). The process of fabricating microelectronic circuits is essentially one of 
building discrete component characteristics either into or onto a single substrate. This is far different from 
soldering resistors, capacitors, transistors, inductors, and other discrete components into place with wires 
and lugs. The component characteristics built into microcircuits are referred to as ELEMENTS rather than 
discrete components. Microcircuits have a high number of these elements per substrate compared to a 
circuit with discrete components of the same relative size. As a matter of fact, microelectronic circuits 
often contain thousands of times the number of discrete components. The term HIGH EQUIVALENT 
CIRCUIT DENSITY is a description of this element-to-discrete part relationship. For example, suppose 
you have a circuit with 1,000 discrete components mounted on a chassis which is 8 × 10 × 2 inches. The 
equivalent circuit in microelectronics might be built into or onto a single substrate which is only 3/8 × 1 × 
1/4 inch. The 1,000 elements of the microcircuit would be very close to each other (high density) by </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

or a combination of microcircuits and discrete conventional electronic components that performs one or 
more distinct functions is a microcircuit module. The module is constructed as an independently

discrete components. Repair consists of removing the faulty DIP or discrete component from the pcb and

</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-39 illustrates how individual boards are mated to form the multilayer unit. Although all 
multilayer boards are similarly constructed, various methods can be used to interconnect the circuitry 
from layer to layer. Three proven processes are the clearance-hole, plated-through hole, and layer build-
up methods. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">CLEARANCE-HOLE METHOD.—In the CLEARANCE-HOLE method, a hole is drilled in the 
copper island (terminating end) of the appropriate conductor on the top layer. This provides access to a 
conductor on the second layer as shown by hole A in figure 1-40. The clearance hole is filled with solder 
to complete the connection. Usually, the hole is drilled through the entire assembly at the connection site. 
This small hole is necessary for the SOLDER-FLOW PROCESS used with this interconnection method.

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">1-38 
</p><p class="paragraph">Conductors located several layers below the top are connected by using a STEPPED-DOWN HOLE 
PROCESS. Before assembly of a three-level board, a clearance hole is drilled down to the first layer to be 
interconnected. The first layer to be interconnected is predrilled with a hole smaller than those drilled in 
layers 1 and 2; succeeding layers to be connected have progressively smaller clearance holes. After 
assembly, the exposed portion of the conductors are interconnected by filling the stepped-down holes 
with solder, as shown by hole B in figure 1-40. The larger the number of interconnections required at one 
point, the larger must be the diameter of the clearance holes on the top layer. Large clearance holes on the 
top layer allow less space for components and reduce packaging density. 
</p><p class="paragraph">PLATED-THROUGH-HOLE METHOD.—The PLATED-THROUGH-HOLE method of 
interconnecting conductors is illustrated in figure 1-41. The first step is to temporarily assemble all the 
layers into their final form. Holes corresponding to required connections are drilled through the entire 
assembly and then the unit is disassembled. The internal walls of those holes to be interconnected are 
plated with metal which is 0.001 inch thick. This, in effect, connects the conductor on the board surface 
through the hole itself. This process is identical to that used for standard printed circuit boards. The 
boards are then reassembled and permanently bonded together with heat and pressure. All the holes are 
plated through with metal. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">LAYER BUILD-UP METHOD.—With the LAYER BUILD-UP method, conductors and 
insulation layers are alternately deposited on a backing material, as shown in figure 1-42. This method 
produces copper interconnections between layers and minimizes the thermal expansion effects of 
dissimilar materials. However, reworking the internal connections in built-up layers is usually difficult, if 
not impossible. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Advantages and Disadvantages of Printed Circuit Boards 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Some of the advantages and disadvantages of printed circuit boards were discussed earlier in this 
topic. They are strong, lightweight, and eliminate point-to-point wiring. Multilayer printed circuit boards 
allow more components per card. Entire circuits or even subsystems may be placed on the same card. 
However, these cards do have some drawbacks. For example, all components are wired into place, repair 
of cards requires special training and/or special equipment, and some cards cannot be economically 
repaired because of their complexity (these are referred to as THROWAWAYS).

density packaging. The evolution of this concept, from discrete components to microelectronics, has 
progressed through various stages. These stages began with cordwood assemblies and functional blocks 
and led to complete subsystems in a single package. Examples of these configurations are shown in figure

</p><p class="paragraph">The cordwood assembly, shown in view (A) of figure 1-43, was designed and fabricated in various 
forms and sizes, depending on user requirements. This design was used to reduce the physical size and 
increase the component density and complexity of circuits through the use of discrete devices. However, 
the use of the technique was somewhat limited by the size of available discrete components used. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Micromodules 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The next generation assembly was the micromodule. Designers tried to achieve maximum density in 
this design by using discrete components, thick- and thin-film technologies, and the insulator substrate 
principle. The method used in this construction technique allowed for the efficient use of space and also 
provided the mechanical strength necessary to withstand shock and vibration. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor technology was then improved further with the introduction of the integrated circuit. 
The flat-pack IC form, shown in view (C), emphasizes the density and complexity that exists with this 
technique. This technology provides the means of reducing the size of circuits. It also allows the reduction 
of the size of systems through the advent of the lsi circuits that are now available and vlsi circuits that are 
being developed by various IC manufacturers.

After these system requirements have been established, components, applications, and packaging forms 
are considered. This then leads to the most effective system form.

</p><p class="paragraph">In the example in table 1-1, the environmental requirements are set forth as MILITARY 
STANDARDS for performance. The actual standard for a particular factor is in parentheses. To meet 
each of these standards, the equipment or component must perform adequately within the test guidelines. 
For example, to pass the shock test, the component must withstand a shock of 250 to 600 Gs (force of 
gravity). During vibration testing, the component must withstand vibrations of 5 to 15 cycles per second 
for 0.06 day, or about 1 1/2 hours; 16 to 25 cycles for 1 hour; and 26 to 33 cycles for 1/2 hour. Rf 
interference between 30 hertz and 40 gigahertz must not affect the performance of the component. 
Temperature and humidity factors are self-explanatory. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When selecting the most useful packaging technique, the system designer must consider not only the 
environmental and electrical performance requirements of the system, but the maintainability aspects as 
well. The system design will, therefore, reflect performance requirements of maintenance and repair 
personnel. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRICAL-CONSIDERATIONS-1-42-">ELECTRICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The electrical characteristics of a component can sometimes be adversely affected when it is placed 
in a given system. This effect can show up as signal distortion, an improper timing sequence, a frequency 
shift, or numerous other types of unwanted interactions. Techniques designed to minimize the effects of 
system packaging on component performance are incorporated into system design by planners. These 
techniques should not be altered during your maintenance. Several of the techniques used by planners are

</h3><p class="paragraph">To meet the high-frequency characteristics and propagation timing required by present and future 
systems, the device package must not have excessive distributed capacitance and/or inductance. This type 
of packaging is accomplished in the design of systems using ICs and other microelectronic devices by 
using shorter leads internal to the package and by careful spacing of complex circuits on printed circuit 
boards. To take advantage of the inherent speed of the integrated circuit, you must keep the signal 
propagation time between circuits to a minimum. The signal is delayed approximately 1 nanosecond per 
foot, so reducing the distance between circuits as much as possible is necessary. This requires the use of 
structures, such as high-density digital systems with an emphasis on large-scale integration, for systems in 
the future. Also, maintenance personnel should be especially concerned with the spacing of circuits, lead 
dress, and surface cleanliness. These factors affect the performance of high-speed digital and analog 
circuits.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-2-1-">INTRODUCTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">As mentioned in topic 1, advances in the field of microelectronics are impressive. With every step 
forward in production development, a corresponding step forward must be made in maintenance and 
repair techniques. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This topic will teach you how the Navy is coping with the new technology and how personnel are 
trained to carry out the maintenance and repair of complex equipment. The program discussed in this 
topic is up to date at this time, but as industry advances, so must the capabilities of the technician. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">MINIATURE AND MICROMINIATURE (2M) ELECTRONIC REPAIR PROGRAM 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Training requirements for miniature and microminiature repair personnel were developed under 
guidelines established by the Chief of Naval Operations. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) 
developed a program which provides for the proper training in miniature and microminiature repair. This 
program, NAVSEA Miniature/Microminiature (2M) Electronic Repair, authorizes and provides proper 
tools and equipment and establishes a personnel certification program to maintain quality repair. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Naval Air Systems Command has developed a similar program specifically for the aviation 
community. The two programs are patterned after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) high-reliability soldering studies and have few differences other than the administrative chain of 
command. For purposes of this topic, we will use the NAVSEA manual for reference. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The 2M program covers all phases of miniature and microminiature repair. It establishes the training 
curriculum for repair personnel, outlines standards of workmanship, and provides guidelines for specific 
repairs to equipment, including the types of tools to use. This part of the program ensures high-reliability 
repairs by qualified technicians. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Upon satisfactory completion of a 2M training course, a technician will be CERTIFIED to perform 
repairs. The CERTIFICATION is issued at the level at which the technician qualifies and specifies what 
type of repairs the technician is permitted to perform. The two levels of qualification for technicians are 
MINIATURE COMPONENT REPAIR and MICROMINIATURE COMPONENT REPAIR. Miniature 
component repair is limited to discrete components and single- and double-sided printed circuit boards, 
including removal and installation of most integrated circuit devices. Microminiature component repair 
consists of repairs to highly complex, densely packaged, multilayer printed circuit boards. Sophisticated 
repair equipment is used that may include a binocular microscope. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To ensure that a technician is maintaining the required qualification level, periodic evaluations are 
conducted. By inspecting and evaluating the technician's work, certification teams ensure that the 
minimum standards for the technician's level of qualification are met. If the standards are met, the 
technician is recertified; if not, the certification is withheld pending retraining and requalification. This 
portion of the program ensures the high-quality, high-reliability repairs needed to meet operational 
requirements.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LEVELS-OF-MAINTENANCE-2-2-">LEVELS OF MAINTENANCE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Effective maintenance and repair of microelectronic devices require one of three levels of 
maintenance. Level-of-repair designations called SOURCE, MAINTENANCE, and RECOVERABILITY 
CODES (SM&amp;R) have been developed and are assigned by the Chief of Naval Material. These codes are  
D for DEPOT LEVEL, I for INTERMEDIATE LEVEL, and O for ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DEPOT-LEVEL MAINTENANCE. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SM&amp;R Code D maintenance is the responsibility of maintenance activities designated by the systems 
command (NAVSEA, NAVAIR, NAVELEX). This code augments stocks of serviceable material. It also 
supports codes I and O activities by providing more extensive shop facilities and equipment and more 
highly skilled technicians. Code D maintenance includes repair, modification, alteration, modernization, 
and overhaul as well as reclamation or reconstruction of parts, assemblies, subassemblies, and 
components.  Finally, it includes emergency manufacture of nonavailable parts. Code D maintenance also 
provides technical assistance to user activities and to code I maintenance organizations. Code D 
maintenance is performed in shops, located in shipyards and shore-based facilities, including contractor 
maintenance organizations. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTERMEDIATE-LEVEL-MAINTENANCE-2-2-">INTERMEDIATE-LEVEL MAINTENANCE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">SM&amp;R code I maintenance, performed at mobile shops, tenders or shore-based repair facilities 
(SIMAS) provides direct support to user organizations. Code I maintenance includes calibration, repair, 
or replacement of damaged or unserviceable parts, components, or assemblies, and emergency 
manufacture of nonavailable parts. It also provides technical assistance to ships and stations. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

maintenance consists of inspecting, servicing, lubricating, adjusting, and replacing parts, minor 
assemblies, and subassemblies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An INTEGRATED LOGISTICS SUPPORT PLAN (ILSP) determines the maintenance level for 
electronic assemblies, modules, and boards for each equipment assigned to an activity. The ILSP codes 
the items according to the normal maintenance capabilities of that activity. This results in two additional 
repair-level categories - NORMAL and EMERGENCY. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Normal Repairs 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Generally, 2M repairs are performed at the level set forth in the maintenance plan and specified by 
the appropriate SM&amp;R coding for each board or module. Therefore, normal repairs include all repairs 
except organizational-level repair of D- and I-coded items and intermediate-level repair of D-coded items. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Emergent/Emergency Repairs 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the NAVSEA 2M Electronic Repair Program, emergent/emergency repairs are those arising 
unexpectedly. They may require prompt repair action to restore a system or piece of equipment to 
operating condition where normal repairs are not authorized. These Code O repairs on boards or modules 
are normally SM&amp;R-coded for Code D repairs. Emergent/emergency 2M repairs may be performed only 
to meet an urgent operational commitment as directed by the operational commander. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">SOURCE, MAINTENANCE, AND RECOVERABILITY (SM&amp;R) CODES 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The Allowance Parts List (APL) is a technical document prepared by the Navy for specific 
equipment/system support. This document lists the repair parts requirements for a ship having the exact 
equipment/component. To determine the availability of repair parts, the 2M technician must be familiar 
with these documents. SM&amp;R codes, found in APLs, determine where repair parts can be obtained, who 
is authorized to make the repair, and at what maintenance level the item may be recovered or condemned.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TEST-EQUIPMENT-2-3-">TEST EQUIPMENT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Microelectronic developments have had a great impact on the test equipment, tools, and facilities 
necessary to maintain systems using this technology. This section discusses, in general terms, the 
importance of these developments. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Early electronic systems could be completely checked-out with general-purpose electronic test 
equipment (GPETE), such as multimeters, oscilloscopes, and signal generators. Using this equipment to 
individually test the microelectronics components in one of today's very complex electronic systems 
would be extremely difficult if not impossible. Therefore, improvements in system testing procedures 
have been necessary. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
<div class="page mainpage" id="73"><div class="centered">
            <div class="pagination">

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">2-4 
</p><p class="paragraph">One such improvement in system testing is the design of a method that can test systems at various 
functional levels. This allows groups of components to be tested as a whole and reduces the time required 
to test components individually. One advantage of this method is that complete test plans can be written 
to provide the best sequencing of tests for wave shape or voltage outputs for each functional level. This 
method of testing has led to the development of special test sets, called AUTOMATED TEST 
EQUIPMENT (ATE). These test sets are capable of simulating actual operating conditions of the system 
being tested. Appropriate signal voltages are applied by the test set to the various functional levels of the 
system, and the output of each level is monitored. Testing sequences are prewritten and steps may be 
switched-in manually or automatically. The limits for each functional level are preprogrammed to give 
either a "go/no-go" indication or diagnose a fault to a component. A go/no-go indication means that a 
functional level either meets the test specifications (go) or fails to meet the specifications (no-go). 
</p><p class="paragraph">If a no-go indication is observed for a given function, the area of the system in which it occurs is 
then further tested. You can test the trouble area by using general purpose electronic test equipment and 
the troubleshooting manual for the system. General purpose electronic test equipment (GPETE) will be 
discussed later in this topic. (Effective fault isolation at this point depends on the experience of the 
technician and the quality of the troubleshooting manual.) After the fault is located, the defective part is 
then replaced or repaired, depending on the nature of the defect. At this stage, the defective part is usually 
a circuit card, a module, or a discrete part, such as a switch, relay, transistor, or resistor. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BUILT-IN-TEST-EQUIPMENT-2-4-">BUILT-IN TEST EQUIPMENT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">One type of fault isolation that can be either on-line or off-line is BUILT-IN TEST EQUIPMENT 
(BITE). BITE is any device that is permanently mounted in the prime equipment (system); it is used only 
for testing the equipment or system in which it is installed either independently or in association with 
external test equipment. The specific types of BITE are too varied to discuss here, but may be as simple 
as a set of meters and switches or as complex as a computer-controlled diagnostic system. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ON-LINE-TEST-EQUIPMENT-2-4-">ON-LINE TEST EQUIPMENT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Functional-level testing and modular design have been successfully applied to most electronic 
systems in use today; however, the trend toward increasing the number of subassemblies within a module 
by incorporating microelectronics will make this method of testing less and less effective. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The increased circuit density and packaging possible with microelectronic components makes 
troubleshooting and fault location difficult or, in some cases, impossible. The technician's efforts must be 
aided if timely repairs to microelectronic systems are to be achieved. These repairs are particularly 
significant when considered in the light of the very stringent availability requirements for today's systems. 
This dilemma has led to the present trend of developing both ON-LINE and OFF-LINE automatic test 
systems. The on-line systems are designed to continuously monitor performance and to automatically 
isolate faults to removable assemblies. Off-line systems automatically check removable assemblies and 
isolate faults to the component level. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Two on-line systems, the TEST EVALUATION AND MONITORING SYSTEM (TEAMS) and the 
CENTRALIZED AUTOMATIC TEST SYSTEM (CATS), are presently in production or under 
development by the Navy. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Test Evaluation and Monitoring System (TEAMS) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">TEAMS is an on-line system that continuously monitors the performance of electronic systems and 
isolates faults to a removable assembly. This system is controlled by a computer using a test program on 
perforated or magnetic tape, cassettes, or disks. Displays are used to present the status of the equipment 
and to provide data with instructions for fault localization. Lights, usually an LED, are used to indicate </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

printer provides a read out copy of the test results. These results are used by maintenance personnel to 
isolate the fault in a removable assembly to a replaceable part. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Centralized Automatic Test System (CATS) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">CATS is an on-line system that continuously monitors the performance of electronic systems, 
predicts system performance trends, and isolates faults to removable assemblies. CATS, however, is 
computer controlled and the instructions are preprogrammed in the computer memory. The status of the 
electronic system being monitored by CATS is presented in various forms. Information concerning a 
failed module is presented on a status- and fault-isolation indicator to alert the maintenance technician of 
the need for a replacement module. If equipment design does not permit module replacement, complete 
electrical schematics and fault-isolation procedures will be made available to the maintenance technician. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OFF-LINE-TEST-EQUIPMENT-2-5-">OFF-LINE TEST EQUIPMENT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy has under development an advanced assembly tester designated Naval Electronics 
Laboratory Assembly Tester (NELAT). This tester is an off-line, general-purpose test system designed to 
check-out and isolate faults in electronic plug-in assemblies, modules, and printed circuit boards. 
Equipped with a complete range of instrumentation, the system allows testing to be accomplished 
automatically, semiautomatically, or manually. In the automatic mode, a complete range of stimuli 
generators and monitors are connected and switched by means of a microfilmed test program. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The NELAT incorporates modular electronic assemblies that will facilitate updating of the system. 
The system is designed for use aboard ship. When put into service, this tester will greatly improve the 
technician's capability in the checkout and fault isolation of microelectronic assemblies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another important system for off-line testing is the Versatile Avionic Shop Test System (VAST). 
VAST is used in the aviation community for fault isolation in aviation electronics (avionics) equipment 
on ships and shore commands with aircraft INTERMEDIATE MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENTS 
(AIMDs). It is an automatic, high-speed, computer controlled, general-purpose test set that will isolate 
faults to the component level. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">GENERAL-PURPOSE ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT (GPETE) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When no automatic means of accomplishing fault isolation is available, general-purpose electronic 
test equipment and good troubleshooting procedures is used; however, such fault diagnosis should be 
attempted only by experienced technicians. Misuse of electrical probes and test equipment may 
permanently damage boards or microelectronic devices attached to them. The proximity of leads to one 
another and the effects of interconnecting the wiring make the testing of boards extremely difficult; these 
factors also make drift or current leakage measurements practically impossible. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Boards that have been conformally coated are difficult to probe because the coating is often too thick 
to penetrate for a good electrical contact. These boards must be removed for electrical probe testing. 
Many boards, however, are designed with test points that can be monitored either with special test sets or 
general-purpose test equipment. Another method of obtaining access to a greater number of test points is 
to use extender cards or cables. The use of extender cards or cables makes these test points easier to 
check. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Special care should be exercised when probing integrated circuits; they are easily damaged by 
excessive voltages or currents, and component leads may be physically damaged. Precautions concerning 
the use of test equipment for troubleshooting equipments containing integrated circuits are similar to </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

and current-sensitive devices. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Voltage and resistance tests of resistors, transistors, inductors, and so forth, are usually effective in 
locating complete failures or defects that exhibit large changes from normal circuit characteristics; 
however, these methods are time-consuming and sometimes unsuccessful. The suspect device often must 
be desoldered, removed from the circuit, and then retested to verify the fault. If the defect is not verified, 
the device must be resoldered to the board again. If this procedure has to be repeated several times, or if 
the board is conformally coated, the defect may never be located. In fact, the circuit may be further 
damaged by the attempt to locate the fault. For these reasons, the device should never be desoldered until 
all possible in-circuit tests are performed and the defect verified.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Work stations should have a minimum work surface of at least 60-inches wide and 30-inches deep. 
Standard Navy desks are excellent for this purpose. Standard shipboard workbenches are acceptable; 
however, off-white or pastel-colored heat-resistant tops should be installed on the workbenches. Chairs 
should be the type with backs and without arms. They should be comfortably padded and of the proper 
height to match the work surface height. Drawers or other suitable tool storage areas are usually provided.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HIGH-RELIABILITY-SOLDERING-2-19-">HIGH-RELIABILITY SOLDERING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The most common types of miniature and microminiature repair involve the removal and 
replacement of circuit components. The key to these repairs is a firm knowledge of solder and high-
reliability soldering techniques. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Solder is a metal alloy used to join two or more metals with a metallic bond. The bonding occurs 
when molten solder dissolves a small amount of the metals and then cools to form a solid connection. The 
solder most commonly used in electronic assemblies is an alloy of tin and lead. Tin-lead alloys are 
identified by their percentage in the solder; the tin content is given first. Solder marked 60/40 is an alloy 
of 60 percent tin and 40 percent lead. The two most common alloys used in electronics are 60/40 and 
63/37. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The melting temperature of tin-lead solder varies depending on the percentage of each metal. Lead 
melts at a temperature of 621 degrees Fahrenheit, and tin melts at 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Combinations 
of the two metals melt into a liquid at different temperatures. The 63/37 combination melts into a liquid at 
361 degrees Fahrenheit. At this temperature, the alloy changes from a solid directly to a liquid with no 
plastic or semiliquid state. An alloy with such a sharp changing point is called a EUTECTIC ALLOY. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the percentages of tin and lead are varied, the melting temperature increases. Alloy of 60/40 melts 
at 370 degrees Fahrenheit, and alloy of 70/30 melts at approximately 380 degrees Fahrenheit. Alloys, </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">other than eutectic, go through a plastic or semiliquid state in their heating and cooling stages. Solder 
joints that are disturbed (moved) during the plastic state will result in damaged connections. For this 
reason, 63/37 solder is the best alloy for electronic work. Solder with 60/40 alloy is also acceptable, but it 
goes into a plastic state between 361 and 370 degrees Fahrenheit. When soldering joints with 60/40 alloy, 
you must exercise extreme care to prevent movement of the component during cooling. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-USE-OF-FLUX-IN-SOLDER-BONDING-2-20-">USE OF FLUX IN SOLDER BONDING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Reliable solder connections can only be accomplished with clean surfaces. Using solvents and 
abrasives to clean the surfaces to be soldered is essential if you are to achieve good solder connections. In 
almost all cases, however, this cleaning process is insufficient because oxides form rapidly on heated 
metal surfaces. The rapid formation of oxides creates a nonmetallic film that prevents solder from 
contacting the metal. Good metal-to-metal contact must be obtained before good soldering joints may 
take place. Flux removes these surface oxides from metals to be soldered and keeps them removed during 
the soldering operation. Flux chemically breaks down surface oxides and causes the oxide film to loosen 
and break free from the metals being soldered. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Soldering fluxes are divided into three classifications or groups: CHLORIDE FLUX (commonly 
called ACID), ORGANIC FLUX, and ROSIN FLUX. Each flux has characteristics specific to its own 
group. Chloride fluxes are the most active of the three groups. They are effective on all common metals 
except aluminum and magnesium. Chloride fluxes, however, are NOT suitable for electronic soldering 
because they are highly corrosive, electrically conductive, and are difficult to remove from the soldered 
joint. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Organic fluxes are nearly as active as chloride fluxes, yet are less corrosive and easier to remove 
than chloride fluxes. Also, these fluxes are NOT satisfactory for electronic soldering because they must 
be removed completely to prevent corrosion. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Rosin fluxes ARE ideally suited to electronic soldering because of their molecular structure. The 
most common flux used in electronic soldering is a solution of pure rosin dissolved in suitable solvent. 
This solution works well with the tin- or solder-dipped metals commonly used for wires, lugs, and 
connectors. While inert at normal temperatures, rosin fluxes break down and become highly active at 
soldering temperatures. In addition, rosin is nonconductive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most electronic solder, in wire form, is made with one or more cores of rosin flux. When the joint or 
connection is heated and the wire solder is applied to the joint (not the iron), the flux flows onto the 
surface of the joint and removes the oxide. This process aids the wetting action of the solder. With enough 
heat the solder flows and replaces the flux. Insufficient heat results in a poor connection because the 
solder does not replace the flux.

type of repair station?

AUTHORIZATION TO ATTEMPT THESE TYPES OF REPAIRS WITHOUT 
OFFICIAL 2M CERTIFICATION. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the following sections, you will study the general procedures used in the repair, removal, and 
replacement of specific types of electronic components. By studying these procedures, you will become 
familiar with some of the more common types of repair work. Before repair work can be performed on a 
miniature or microminiature assembly, the technician must consider the type of specialized coating that 
usually covers the assembly. These coatings are referred to as CONFORMAL COATINGS. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CONFORMAL-COATINGS-3-2-">CONFORMAL COATINGS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Conformal coatings are protective material applied to electronic assemblies to prevent damage from 
corrosion, moisture, and stress. These coatings include epoxy, parylene, silicone, polyurethane, varnish, 
and lacquer. Coatings are applied in a liquid form; when dry, they exhibit characteristics that improve 
reliability. These characteristics are: 
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Heat conductivity to carry heat away from components 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Hardness and strength to support and protect components 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Low moisture absorption 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Electrical insulation 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">Conformal Coating Removal 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Because of the characteristics that conformal coatings exhibit, they must be removed before any 
work can be done on printed circuit boards. The coating must be removed from all lead and pad/eyelet 
areas of the component. It should also be removed to or below the widest point of the component body. 
Complete removal of the coating from the board is not done. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Methods of coating removal are thermal, mechanical, and chemical. The method of removal depends 
on the type of coating used. Table 3-1 shows suggested methods of removal of some types. Note that 
most of the methods are variations of mechanical removal.    </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">3-4 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The coating material can best be identified through proper documentation; for example, technical 
manuals and engineering drawings. If this information is not available, the experienced technician can 
usually determine the type of material by testing the, hardness, transparency, thickness, and solvent 
solubility of the coating. The thermal (heat) properties may also be tested to determine the ease of 
removal of the coating by heat. The methods of removal discussed here describe the basic concept, but 
not the step-by-step "how to" procedures. 
</p><p class="paragraph">THERMAL REMOVAL.—Thermal removal consists of using controlled heat through specially 
shaped tips attached to a handpiece. Soldering irons should never be used for coating removal because the 
high temperatures will cause the coatings to char, possibly damaging the board materials. Modified tips or 
cutting blades heated by soldering irons also are not used; they may not have proper heat capacity or 
allow the hand control necessary for effective removal. Also, the thin plating of the circuit may be 
damaged by scraping. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The thermal parting tool, used with the variable power supply, has interchangeable tips, as shown in 
figure 3-1, that allow for efficient coating removal. These thin, blade-like instruments act as heat 
generators and will maintain the heat levels necessary to accomplish the work. Tips can be changed easily 
to suit the configuration of the workpiece. These tips cool quickly after removal of power because their 
small thermal mass and special alloy material easily give up residual heat. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The softening or breakdown point of different coatings vary, which is a concern when you are using 
this method. Ideally, the softening, point is below the solder melting temperature. However, when the 
softening point is equal to or above the solder melting point, you must take care in applying heat at the 
solder joint or in component areas. The work must be performed rapidly to limit the heating of the area 
involved and to prevent damage to the board and other components. 
</p><p class="paragraph">HOT-AIR JET REMOVAL.—In principle, the hot-air jet method of coating removal uses 
controlled, temperature-regulated air to soften or break down the coating, as shown in figure 3-2. By 
controlling the temperature, flow rate, and shape of the jet, you may remove coatings from almost any 
workpiece configuration without causing any damage. When you use the hot-air jet, you do not allow it to </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the removal process. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">POWER-TOOL REMOVAL DESCRIPTION.—Power-tool removal is the use of abrasive 
grinding or cutting to mechanically remove coatings. Abrasive grinding/rubbing techniques are effective 
on thin coatings (less than 0.025 inch) while abrasive cutting methods are effective on coatings greater 
than 0.025 inch. This method permits consistent and precise removal of coatings without mechanical 
damage or dangerous heating to electronic components. A variable-speed mechanical drive handpiece 
permits fingertip-control and proper speed and torque to ease the handling of gum-type coatings. A 
variety of rotary abrasive materials and cutting tools is required for removal of the various coating types. 
These specially designed tools include BALL MILLS, BURRS, and ROTARY BRUSHES. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ball mill design places the most efficient cutting area on the side of the ball rather than at the 
end. Different mill sizes are used to enter small areas where thick coatings need to be removed 
(ROUTED). Rubberized abrasives of the proper grade and grit are ideally suited for removing thin, hard 
coatings from flat surfaces; soft coatings adhere to and coat the abrasive causing it to become ineffective. 
Rotary bristle brushes work better than rubberized abrasives on contoured or irregular surfaces, such as 
soldered connections, because the bristles conform to surface irregularities. Ball mill routing and abrasion 
removal are shown in figure 3-3. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">CUT AND PEEL.—Silicone coatings (also referred to as RTV) can easily be removed by cutting 
and peeling. As with all mechanical removal methods, care must be taken to prevent damage to either 
components or boards. 
</p><p class="paragraph">CHEMICAL REMOVAL.—Chemical removal uses solvents to break down the coatings. General 
application is not recommended as the solvent may cause damage to the boards by dissolving the adhesive 
materials that bond the circuits to the boards. These solvents may also dissolve the POTTING 
COMPOUNDS (insulating material that completely seals a component or assembly) used on other parts 
or assemblies. Only thin acrylic coatings (less than 0.025 inch) are readily removable by solvents. Mild 
solvents, such as ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL, XYLENE, or TRICHLOROETHANE, may be used to 
remove soluble coatings on a spot basis. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Evaluations show that many tool and technique combinations have proven to be reliable and 
effective in coating removal; no single method is the best in all situations. When the technician is 
determining the best method of coating removal to use, the first consideration is the effect that it will have 
on the equipment. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Conformal Coating Replacement 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Once the required repairs have been completed the conformal coating must be replaced. To ensure 
the same protective characteristics, you should use the same type of replacement coating as that removed. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">To properly perform the required repair, the 2M technician must be knowledgeable of the techniques 
used by manufacturers in the production of electronic assemblies. The techniques, materials, and types of 
components determine the repair procedures used. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Interconnections and Assemblies 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Assemblies may range from simple, single-sided boards with standard-sized components to double-
sided or multilayered boards with miniature and microminiature components. The variations in 
component lead termination and mounting techniques used by manufacturers present the technician with a 
complex task. For example, the 2M technician is concerned about the type of solder joints on the module. 
To determine the solder joint type, the technician must consider the board circuitry, hole reinforcement, 
and lead termination style. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Recall the discussion from topic 1 on printed circuit board construction and the types of 
interconnections used. Single-sided and some double-sided boards have UNSUPPORTED HOLES where 
component leads are soldered to the pad. The clearance-hole method is also an interconnection with no 
hole support. SUPPORTED HOLES are those that have metallic reinforcement along the hole walls. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to the plated-through hole you studied earlier, EYELETS, shown in figure 3-4, view (A), 
view (B), and view (C), are also used in both manufacturing and repair. These hole-reinforcing devices 
are usually made of pure copper, but are often plated with gold, tin, or a tin-lead alloy. The copper-based 
eyelet is pliable; when set, it reduces the possibility of circuit board damage. Eyelets may be inserted into 
single-sided or double-sided boards and are of three different types - ROLL SET, FUNNEL SET, and 
FLAT SET. All three are types referred to as INTERFACIAL CONNECTIONS. Interfacial connections 
identify the procedure of connecting circuitry on one side of a board with the circuitry on the other side. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see, the flat-set eyelet actually provides reinforcement for the pads on both sides of the 
circuit board and reinforces the hole itself. The design of the roll-set eyelet (which may trap gasses, flux, 
or other contaminants, and obscures view of the finished solder flow) is not acceptable as a repair 
technique. The funnel-set eyelet does not provide as much pad reinforcement as the other types. However, 
it provides better "outgassing" of flux, moisture, or solvents from the space between the eyelet and the 
hole wall. It also provides a better view of the finished solder connection than the roll-set eyelet. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Lead Terminations 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The finished circuit board consists of conductive paths, pads, and drilled holes with components 
and/or wires assembled directly to it. Leads and wires may terminate in three ways: (1) through the hole 
in the board, (2) above the surface of the board, or (3) on the surface of the board. 
</p><p class="paragraph">THROUGH-HOLE TERMINATION.—This style provides extra support for the circuit pads, the 
hole, and the lead by a continuous solder connection from one side of the circuit board to the other. Three 
basic variations of through-hole termination are the CLINCHED LEAD (two types), STRAIGHT-
THROUGH LEAD, and OFFSET PAD. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Clinched Lead.—The clinched-lead termination is usually used with unsupported holes, but is found 
with supported holes as well. Both clinched-lead types, FULLY CLINCHED and SEMICLINCHED 
(figure 3-5), provide component stability. Like the fully clinched lead, the semi-clinched lead also 
provides stability during assembly. However, this termination can be easily straightened to allow removal 
of the solder joint should rework or repair be required. Note that the fully clinched lead is bent 90 degrees 
while the semiclinched lead is bent 45 degrees.

</p><p class="paragraph">Straight-Through Lead.—Straight-through terminations (figure 3-6) are used by manufacturers 
when the termination stability is not a prime consideration. This termination type may also be used with 
unsupported holes. The through-hole termination provides a better, solder-joint contact area and more 
solder support; the solder runs from the component side to the conductor. The straight-through 
termination is the easiest to remove and rework.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Component Desoldering 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Most of the damage in printed circuit board repair occurs during disassembly or component removal. 
More specifically, much of this damage occurs during the desoldering process. To remove components 
for repair or replacement, the technician must first determine the type of joint that is used to connect the 
component to the board. The technician may then determine the most effective method for desoldering 
these connections. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Three generally accepted methods of solder connection removal involve the use of SOLDER WICK, 
a MANUALLY CONTROLLED VACUUM PLUNGER, or a motorized solder extractor using 
CONTINUOUS VACUUM AND/OR PRESSURE. Of all the extraction methods currently in use, 
continuous vacuum is the most versatile and reliable. Desoldering becomes a routine operation and the 
quantity and quality of desoldering work increases with the use of this technique. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SOLDER WICKING.—IN this technique, finely stranded copper wire or braiding (wick) is 
saturated with liquid flux. Most commercial wick is impregnated with flux; the liquid flux adds to the 
effectiveness of the heat transfer and should be used whenever possible. The wick is then applied to a 
solder joint between the solder and a heated soldering iron tip, as shown in figure 3-10. The combination 
of heat, molten solder, and air spaced in the wick creates a capillary action and causes the solder to be 
drawn into the wick. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">This method should be used to remove surface joints only, such as those found on single-sided and 
double-sided boards without plated-through holes or eyelets. It can also remove excessive solder from flat 
surfaces and terminals. The reason is that the capillary action of the wicking is not strong enough to 
overcome the surface tension of the molten solder or the capillary action of the hole. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MANUALLY CONTROLLED VACUUM PLUNGER.—The second method of removing solder 
involves a manually controlled and operated, one-shot vacuum source. This vacuum source uses a plunger 
mechanism with a heat resistant orifice. The vacuum is applied through this orifice. Figure 3-11 shows the 
latest approved, manual-type desoldering tool. This technique involves melting the solder joint and 
inserting the solder-extractor tip into the molten solder over the soldering iron tip. The plunger is then 
released, creating a short pulse of vacuum to remove the molten solder. Although this method offers a 
positive vacuum rather than the capillary force of the wicking method, it still has limited application. This 
method will not remove 100 percent of the solder and may cause circuit pad lifting because of the 
extremely high vacuum generated and the jarring caused by the plunger action.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because 100 percent of the solder cannot be removed, the extraction method is not usually successful 
with the plated-through solder joint. The component lead in a plated-through hole joint usually rests 
against the side wall of the hole. Even though most of the molten solder is removed by a vacuum, the 
small amount of solder left between the lead and side walls causes a SWEAT JOINT to form. A sweat 
joint is a paper-thin solder joint formed by a minute amount of solder remaining on the conductor lead 
surfaces. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MOTORIZED VACUUM/PRESSURE METHOD.—The most effective method for solder joint 
removal is motorized vacuum extraction. The solder extractor unit, described in topic 2, is used for this 
type of extraction. This method provides controlled combinations of heat and pressure or vacuum for 
solder removal. The motorized vacuum is controlled by a foot switch and differs from the manual vacuum 
in that it provides a continuous vacuum. The solder extraction device is a coaxial, in-line instrument 
similar to a small soldering iron. The device consists of a hollow-tipped heating element, transfer tube, 
and collecting chamber (in the handle) that collects and solidifies the waste solder. This unit is easily 
maneuvered, fully controllable, and provides three modes of operation (figure 3-12): (1) heat and vacuum 
(2) heat and pressure, and (3) hot-air jet. Some power source models provide variable control for pressure 
and vacuum levels as well as temperature control for the heated tubular tip. The extraction tip and heat 
source are combined in one tool. Continuous vacuum allows solder removal with a single heat 
application. Since the slim heating element allows access to confined areas, the technician is protected 
from contact with the hot, glass, solder-trap chamber. Continuous vacuum extraction is the only 
consistent method for overcoming the resweat problem for either dual or multilead devices terminating in 
through-hole solder joints.

</p><p class="paragraph">Motorized Vacuum Method.—In the motorized vacuum method, the heated tip is applied to the 
solder joint. When melted solder is observed, the vacuum is activated by the technician causing the solder 
to be withdrawn from the joint and deposited into the chamber. If the lead is preclipped, it may also be 
drawn into a holding chamber. To prevent SWEATING (reforming a solder joint) to the side walls of the 
plated-through hole joint, the lead is "stirred" with the tip while applying the vacuum. This permits cool 
air to flow into and around the lead and side walls causing them to cool.

to the hole nor for cooling the workpiece. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Hot-Air Jet Method.—The hot-air jet method uses pressure-controlled, heated air to transfer heat to 
the solder joint without physical contact from a solder iron. This permits the reflow of delicate joints 
while minimizing mechanical damage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the solder is removed from the lead and pad area, the technician can observe the actual 
condition of the lead contact to the pad area and the amount of the remaining solder joint. From these 
observed conditions, the technician can then determine a method of removing the component and lead. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With straight-through terminations, the component and lead may be lifted gently from uncoated 
boards with pliers or tweezers. Working with clinched leads on uncoated boards requires that all sweat 
joints be removed and that the leads be unclinched before removal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The techniques that have been described represent the successful methods of desoldering 
components. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the 2M technician must decide which method 
is best suited for the type of solder joint. Two commonly used but unacceptable methods of solder 
removal are heat-and-shake and heat-and-pull methods. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the heat-and-shake method, the solder joint is melted and then the molten solder is shaken from 
the connection. In some cases, the shaking action may include striking the assembly against a surface to 
shake the molten solder out of the joint. This method should NEVER be used because all the solder may 
not be removed and the solder may splatter over other areas of the board. In addition, striking the board 
against a surface can lead to broken boards, damaged components, and lifted pads or conductors. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The heat-and-pull method uses a soldering iron or gang-heater blocks to melt individual or multiple 
solder joints. The component leads are pulled when the solder is melted. This method has many 
shortcomings because of potential damage and should NOT be attempted. Heating blocks are patterned to 
suit specific configurations; but when used on multiple-lead connections, the joints may not be uniformly 
heated. Uneven heating results in plated-through hole damage, pad delamination, or blistering. Damage 
can also result when lead terminations are pulled through the board. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When desoldering is complete, the workpiece must undergo a careful physical inspection for damage 
to the circuit board and the remaining components. The technician should also check the board for 
scorching or charring caused by component failure. Sometimes MEASLING is present. Measling is the 
appearance of light-colored spots. It is caused by small areas of fiberglass strands that have been damaged 
by epoxy overcuring, heat, abrasion, or internal moisture. No cracks or breaks should be visible in the 
board material. None of the remaining components should be cracked, broken, or show signs of 
overheating. The solder joints should be of good quality and not covered by loose or splattered solder, 
which may cause shorts. The technician should examine the board for nicked, cracked, lifted, or 
delaminated conductors and lifted or delaminated pads.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The 2M technician should restore the electronic assembly at least to the original manufacturer's 
standards. Parts should always be remounted or reassembled in the same position and with termination 
methods used by the original manufacturer. This approach ensures a continuation of the original 
reliability of the system. 
</p><p class="paragraph">High reliability connections require thoroughly cleaned surfaces, proper component lead formation 
and termination, and appropriate placement of components on the board. The following paragraphs 
describe the procedures for properly installing components on a board including the soldering of these 
components. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Termination Area Preparation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The termination areas on the board and the component leads are thoroughly cleaned to remove oxide, 
old solder, and other contaminants. Old or excess solder is removed by one of the desoldering techniques 
explained earlier in this topic. A fine abrasive, such as an oil-free typewriter eraser, is used to remove 
oxides. This is not necessary if the area has just been desoldered. All areas to be soldered are cleaned with 
a solvent and then dried with a lint-free tissue to remove cleaning residue. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Component Lead Preparation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Component leads are formed before installation. Both machine- and hand-forming methods are used 
to form the leads. Improper lead formation causes many repairs to be unacceptable. Damage to the 
SEALS (point where lead enters the body of the component) occurs easily during the forming process and 
results in component failure. Consequently, lead-forming procedures have been established. To control 
the lead-forming operation and ensure conformity and quality of repairs, the technician should ensure the 
following: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. The component is centered between the holes, and component leads are formed with proper 
bend-radii and body seal-to-bend distance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The possibility of straining component body seals during lead forming is eliminated. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Stress relief loops are formed without straining component seals while at the same time 
providing the desired lead-to-lead distances. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Leads are measured and formed for both horizontal and vertical component mounting. 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. Transistor leads are formed to suit standard hole spacing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Lead-Forming Specifications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Component leads are formed to provide proper lead spacing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• The minimum distance between the seal (where the lead enters the body of the component) and 
the start of the lead bend must be no less than twice the diameter of the lead, as shown in figure

colored dots, bands, letters, numbers, and signs. Replacement components are mounted to make all 
identification markings readable without disturbing the component. When components are mounted like 
the original, all the identification markings are readable from a single point. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Component identification reads uniformly from left to right, top to bottom, unless polarity 
requirements determine otherwise, as shown in figure 3-15. To locate the top, position the board so the 
part number may be read like a page in a book. By definition, the top of the board is the edge above the

</p><p class="paragraph">FORMATION OF PROPER LEAD TERMINATION.—After component leads are formed and 
inserted into the board, the proper lead length and termination are made before the lead is soldered. 
Generally, if the original manufacturer clinched (either full or semi) the component leads, the replacement 
part is reinstalled with clinched leads. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When clinching is required, leads on single- and double-sided boards are securely clinched in the 
direction of the printed wiring connected to the pad. Clinching is performed with tools that prevent 
damage to the pad or printed wiring. The lead is clinched in the direction of the conductor by bending the 
lead. The leads are clipped so that their minimum clinched length is equal to the radius of the pad. Under 
no circumstances does the clinched lead extend beyond the pad diameter. Natural springback away from 
the pad or printed wiring is acceptable. A gap between the lead end and the pad or printed wiring is 
acceptable when further clinching endangers the pad or printed wiring. These guidelines ensure uniform 
lead length.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Soldering of PCB Components 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The fundamental principles of solder application must be understood and observed to ensure 
consistent and satisfactory results. As discussed in topic 2, the soldering process involves a metal-solvent 
action that joins two metals by dissolving a small amount of the metals at their point of contact. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SOLDERABILITY.—As the solder interacts with the base metals, a good metallurgical bond is 
obtained and metallic continuity is established. This continuity is good for electrical and heat conductivity 
as well as for strength. Solderability measures the ease with which molten solder wets the surfaces of the 
metals being joined. WETTING means the molten solder leaves a continuous permanent film on the metal 
surface. Wetting can only be done properly on a clean surface. All dirt and grease must be removed and 
no oxide layer must exist on the metal surface. Using abrasives and/or flux to remove these contaminants 
produces highly solderable surfaces. 
</p><p class="paragraph">HEAT SOURCE.—The soldering process requires sufficient heat to produce alloy- or metal-solvent 
action. Heat sources include CONDUCTIVE, RESISTIVE, CONVECTIVE, and RADIANT types. The 
type of heat source most commonly used is the conductive-type soldering iron. Delicate electronic 
assemblies require that the thermal characteristics of a soldering iron be carefully balanced and that the 
iron and tip be properly matched to the job. Successful soldering depends on the combination of the iron 
tip temperature, the capacity of the iron to sustain temperature, the time of iron contact with the joint, and 
the relative mass and heat transfer characteristics of the object being soldered. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SELECTION OF PROPER TIP.—The amount of heat and how it is controlled are critical factors 
to the soldering process. The tip of the soldering iron transfers heat from the iron to the work. The shape 
and size of the tip are mainly determined by the type of work to be performed. The tip size and the 
wattage of the element must be capable of rapidly heating the mass to the melting temperature of solder. 
</p><p class="paragraph">After the proper tip is selected and attached to the iron, the operator may control the heat by using 
the variable-voltage control. The most efficient soldering temperature is approximately 550 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Ideally, the joint should be brought to this temperature rapidly and held there for a short 
period of time. In most cases the soldering action should be completed within 2 or 3 seconds. When 
soldering a small-mass connection, control the heat by decreasing the size of the tip. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before heat is applied to solder the joint, a thermal shunt is attached to sensitive component leads 
(diodes, transistors, and ICs). A thermal shunt is used to conduct heat away from the component. Because 
of its large heat content and high thermal conductivity, copper is usually used to make thermal shunts. 
Aluminum also has good conductivity but a smaller heat content; it is also used to conduct heat, 
especially if damage from the physical weight of the clamp is possible. Many types, shapes, and sizes of 
thermal shunts are available. The most commonly used is the clamp design; this is a spring clip (similar to 
an alligator clip) that easily fastens onto the part lead, as shown in figure 3-16. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">APPLICATION OF SOLDER AND SOLDERING IRON TIP.—Before solder is applied to the 
joint, the surface temperature of the parts being soldered is increased above the solder melting point. In 
general, the soldering iron is applied to the point of greatest mass at the connection. This increases the 
heat in the parts to be soldered. Solder is then applied to a clean, fluxed, and properly heated surface. 
When properly applied, the solder melts and flows without direct contact with the heat source and 
provides a smooth, even surface that feathers to a thin edge. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Molten solder forms between the tip and the joint, creating a heat bridge or thermal linkage. This 
heat bridge causes the tip to become part of the joint and allows rapid heat transfer. A solder (heat) bridge 
is formed by melting a small amount of solder at the junction of the tip and the mass being soldered as the 
iron is applied. After the tip makes contact with the lead and the pad and after the heat bridge is 
established, the solder is applied with a wiping motion to form the solder bond. The completed solder 
joint should be bright and shiny in appearance. It should have no cracks or pits, and the solder should 
cover the pad. Examples of preferred solder joints are shown in figure 3-17. They are referred to as full 
fillet joints. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Removal of Plug-In DIPs 
</h3><p class="paragraph">To remove plug in DIPs, use an approved DIP puller, such as the one shown in figure 3-18. The 
puller shown is a plastic device that slips over the ends of the DIP and lifts the DIP evenly out of the 
socket. Before the DIP is removed, the board is marked or a sketch is made of the DIP reference mark 
location; then the reference mark for the replacement part will be in the proper position. The DIP is 
grasped with the puller and gently lifted straight out of the socket. Lifting one side or one end first results 
in bent leads. If the removed DIP is to be placed back in the circuit, particular care is taken in 
straightening bent leads to prevent breaking. To straighten bent leads, the technician grasps the wide 
portion of the lead with one pair of smooth-jaw needle nose pliers; with another pair, the technician then 
bends the lead into alignment with the other leads. Tools used for lead straightening should be cleaned 
with solvent to remove contaminants. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">To replace a plug-in DIP, the technician should clean the leads with solvent and then check the 
proper positioning of the reference mark. To do this, the technician holds the DIP body between the 
thumb and forefinger and places the part on the socket to check pin alignment. The pins are not touched. 
If all pins are properly aligned, the technician presses the part gently into the socket until the part is firmly 
seated. As pressure is applied, each pin is checked to ensure that all pins are going into the socket. If pins 
tend to bend, the part is removed and the pins are straightened. The socket is then inspected to make sure 
the holes are not obstructed. Then the process is repeated. After a thorough visual inspection, the card 
should be ready for testing. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Removal and Replacement of Soldered-In DIPs

</p><p class="paragraph">the chance of damage to the board. Of course, many more leads should be desoldered before the part can 
be removed. Special care must be exercised to make sure all leads are completely free before an attempt is 
made to lift the part off the board. If the part is known to be faulty, or if normal removal may damage the 
board, then the leads should be clipped. Once this has been done, desoldering can be done from both sides 
of the board. After the clipped leads have been desoldered, they can be removed with tweezers or pliers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The removal of DIPs from boards with conformal coatings should be completed in the same manner 
as for other components. The coating should be removed using the preferred method of removal for that 
particular type of material. The coating should be removed from both sides of the board after masking off 
the work area. Particular care should be taken when removing the material from around the delicate leads. 
If the part is to be reused, as much of the coating should be removed from the leads as possible. As with 
DIPs without conformal coatings, if the part is known to be bad or if the possibility of board damage 
exists, the leads are clipped; the part and leads are then removed as described earlier in this section. Once 
the part has been removed, the work area should be completely cleaned to remove any remaining coating 
or solder. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The steps for replacing a soldered-in DIP are similar to those for replacing a plug-in DIP. Once the 
part is in position, it is soldered using the same standard used by the manufacturer, or as close to that 
standard as is possible with the available equipment. The joints should be soldered as quickly as possible 
using only as much heat as is necessary using a skipping pattern. The repaired card should then be 
visually inspected for defects in workmanship, and testing of the card should take place. Once the 
successful repair has been accomplished, a conformal coating should be applied to the work area. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-REMOVAL-AND-REPLACEMENT-OF-TO-PACKAGES-3-27-">REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF TO PACKAGES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">You should recall from chapter 1 of this module, that TO packages are mounted in two ways—
plugged-in or embedded. The term  plug-in, when referring to TOs, should not be confused with DIP 
plug-ins. TOs are normally soldered in place. You will come across sockets for TOs, but not as frequently 
as for DIPs. Figure 3-19 shows the methods of mounting TOs. Notice that plug-ins may either be 
mounted flush with the board surface or above the surface with or without a spacer. The air gap or spacer 
may be used by the manufacturer for a particular purpose. This type of mounting could be used for heat 
dissipation, short circuit protection, or to limit parasitic interaction between components. The spacer also 
provides additional physical support for the TO. The technician is responsible for using the same 
procedure as the manufacturer to replace TOs or any other components. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The procedure for removal of plug-in TOs (with or without conformal coatings) is the same as that 
used for a similarly mounted DIP or discrete component. The conformal coating is removed if required. 
Leads are desoldered and gently lifted out of the board. Then board terminals and component leads are 
cleaned. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In some plug-ins, the leads must be formed before they are placed in a circuit. Care should be taken 
to ensure that seal damage does not occur and that formed leads do not touch the TO case. This would 
result in a short-circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the new part or the one that was removed is installed, the leads are slipped through the spacer 
if required, and the part is properly positioned (reference tab in the proper location). The leads are aligned 
with the terminal holes and gently pressed into position. The part is soldered into place and visually 
inspected. Then the card is tested and the conformal coating is replaced if required. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The removal of an imbedded TO package varies only slightly from the removal of other types of 
mountings. First, the work area is masked and the conformal coating is removed if required. Then the 
desoldering handpiece is used to remove the solder from each lead. When all leads are free, the TO is 
pushed out of the board. If all the leads are free, the TO should slip out of the board easily. The package 
should not be forced out of the board. Excessive pressure may cause additional damage. If the leads are 
not completely free, the leads must be clipped and removed after the package is out of the board. This 
process is shown in figure 3-20. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the two conductors together. When multilead components, such as ICs, are soldered, a skipping pattern is 
used to prevent excessive heat buildup in a single area of the board or component. When soldering is

types of repair. Equally important is the repair of damaged or broken cards. Proper repair of damaged 
boards not only maintains reliability of the board but also maintains reliability of the system. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Cards and boards may be damaged in any of several ways and by a number of causes. Untrained 
personnel making improper repairs and technicians using improper tools are two major causes of 
damage. Improper shipping, packaging, storage, and use are also common sources of damage. The source 
of damage most familiar to technicians is operational failure. Operational failures include cracking caused 
by heat, warping, component overheating, and faulty wiring. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before attempting board repairs, the technician should thoroughly inspect the damage. The decision 
to repair or discard the piece depends on the extent of damage, the level of maintenance authorized, 
operational requirements, and the availability of repair parts and materials. The following procedures will 
help you become familiar with the steps necessary to repair particular types of damage. Remember, only 
qualified personnel are authorized to attempt these repairs.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Safety is a subject of utmost importance to all technical personnel. Potentially hazardous situations 
exist in almost any work area. The disregard of safety precautions can result in personal injury or in the 
loss of equipment or equipment capabilities. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In this section we will discuss two types of safety factors. First, we will cover damage that can occur 
to electronic components because of electrostatic discharge (ESD) and improper handling and stowage of 
parts and equipment. Second, we will cover personal safety precautions that specifically concern the 
technician. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTROSTATIC-DISCHARGE-3-38-">ELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can destroy or damage many electronic components including 
integrated circuits and discrete semiconductor devices. Certain devices are more susceptible to ESD 
damage than others. Because of this, warning symbols are now used to identify ESD-sensitive (ESDS) 
items (figure 3-31). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Static electricity is created whenever two substances (solid or fluid) are rubbed together or separated. 
This rubbing or separation causes the transfer of electrons from one substance to the other; one substance 
then becomes positively charged and the other becomes negatively charged. When either of these charged 
substances comes in contact with a conductor, an electrical current flows until that substance is at the 
same electrical potential as ground. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You commonly experience static build-up during the winter months when you walk across a vinyl or 
carpeted floor. (Synthetics, especially plastics, are excellent generators of static electricity.) If you then 
touch a door knob or other conductor, an electrical arc to ground may result and you may receive a slight 
shock. For a person to experience such a shock, the electrostatic potential created must be 3,500 to 4,000 
volts. Lesser voltages, although present and similarly discharged, normally are not apparent to a person's 
nervous system. Some typical measured static charges caused by various actions are shown in table 3-2. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices are the most susceptible to damage from ESD. For 
example, an MOS field-effect transistor (MOSFET) can be damaged by a static voltage potential of as 
little as 35 volts. Commonly used discrete bipolar transistors and diodes (often used in ESD-protective 
circuits), although less susceptible to ESD, can be damaged by voltage potentials of less than 3,000 
electrostatic volts. Damage does not always result in sudden device failure but sometimes results in 
device degradation and early failure. Table 3-2 clearly shows that electrostatic voltages well in excess of 
3,000 volts can be easily generated, especially under low-humidity conditions. ESD damage of ESDS 
parts or circuit assemblies is possible wherever two or more pins of any of these devices are electrically 
exposed or have low impedance paths. Similarly, an ESDS device in a printed circuit board, or even in 
another pcb that is electrically connected in a series can be damaged if it provides a path to ground. 
Electrostatic discharge damage can occur during the manufacture of equipment or during the servicing of 
the equipment. Damage can occur anytime devices or assemblies are handled, replaced, tested, or inserted 
into a connector. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Technicians should be aware of the many sources of static charge. Table 3-3 lists many common 
sources of electrostatic charge. Although they are of little consequence during most daily activity, they 
become extremely important when you work with ESD material. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">Certified 2M technicians are trained in procedures for reducing the causes of ESD damage. The 
procedures are similar for all levels of maintenance. The following procedure is an example of some of 
the protective measures used to prevent ESD damage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Before starting to service equipment, the technician should be grounded to discharge any static 
electric charge built up on the body. This can be accomplished with the use of a test lead (a 
single-wire conductor with a series resistance of 1 megohm equipped with alligator clips on each 
end). One clip end is connected to the grounded equipment frame, and the other clip end is </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">touched with a bare hand. Figure 3-32 shows a more refined ground strap which frees both hands 
for work. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Equipment technical manuals and packaging material should be checked for ESD warnings and 
instructions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Prior to opening an electrostatic unit package of an electrostatic sensitive device or assembly, clip 
the free end of the test lead to the package. This will cause any static electricity which may have 
built up on the package to discharge. The other end remains connected to the equipment frame or 
other ESD ground.  Keep the unit package grounded until the replacement device or assembly is 
placed in the unit package. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Minimize handling of ESDS devices and assemblies. Keep replacement devices or assemblies, 
with their connector shorting bars, clips, and so forth, intact in their electrostatic-free packages 
until needed.  Place removed repairable ESD devices or assemblies with their connector shorting 
bars/clips installed in electrostatic-free packages as soon as they are removed from the equipment. 
ESDS devices or assemblies are to be transported and stored only in protective packaging. 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. Always avoid unnecessary physical movement, such as scuffing the feet, when handling ESDS 
devices or assemblies. Such movement will  generate additional charges of static electricity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">6. When removing or replacing an ESDS device or assembly in the equipment, hold the device or 
assembly through the electrostatic-free  wrap if possible. Otherwise pick up the device or 
assembly by its body only. Do not touch component leads, connector pins, or any other electrical  
connections or paths on boards, even though they are covered by conformal coating. 
</p><p class="paragraph">7. Do not permit ESDS devices or assemblies to come in contact with clothing or other ungrounded 
materials that could have an electrostatic  charge. The charges on a nonconducting material are 
not equal. A plastic storage bag may have a −10,000 volt potential 1/2 inch from a +15,000 volt 
potential, with many such charges all over the bag. Placing a circuit card inside the bag allows the 
charges to equalize through the pcb conductive paths and components, thereby causing failures. 
Do not hand an ESD device or assembly to another person until the device or assembly is 
protectively packaged. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">8. When moving an ESDS device or assembly, always touch (with bare skin) the surface on which it 
rests for at least one second before picking it up. Before placing it on any surface, touch the 
surface with your free hand for at least one second. The bare skin contact provides a safe 
discharge path for charges accumulated while you are moving around. 
</p><p class="paragraph">9. While servicing equipment containing ESD devices, do not handle or touch materials such as 
plastic, vinyl, synthetic textiles, polished wood, fiberglass, or similar items which create static 
charges; or, be sure to repeat the grounding action with the bare hands after contacting these 
materials. These materials are prime electrostatic generators. 
</p><p class="paragraph">10. If possible, avoid repairs that require soldering at the equipment level. Soldering irons must have 
heater/tips assemblies that are grounded to ac electrical ground. Do not use ordinary plastic solder 
suckers (special antistatic solder suckers are commercially available). 
</p><p class="paragraph">11. Ground the leads of test equipment momentarily before you energize the test equipment and 
before you probe ESD items. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Grounded Work Benches 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Work benches on which ESDS items will be placed and that will be contacted by personnel should 
have ESD protective work surfaces. These protective surfaces should cover the areas where ESD items 
will be placed. Personnel ground straps are also necessary for ESD protective work bench surfaces. These 
straps prevent people from discharging a static charge through an ESDS item to the work bench surface. 
The work bench surface should be connected to ground through a ground cable. The resistance in the 
bench top ground cable should be located at or near the point of contact with the work bench top. The 
resistance should be high enough to limit any leakage current to 5 milliamperes or less; this is taking into 
consideration the highest voltage source within reach of grounded people and all parallel resistances to 
ground, such as wrist ground straps, table tops, and conductive floors. See figure 3-33 for a typical ESD 
ground work bench. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Energized equipment provides protection from ESD damage through operating circuitry. Circuit 
cards with ESD sensitive devices are generally considered safe when installed in an equipment rack; but 
they may be susceptible to damage if a "drawer" or "module" is removed and if connector pins are 
touched (even putting on plastic covers can transfer charges that do damage). There must not be any 
energized equipment placed on the conductive ESD work surface. An ESD work area is for "dead" 
equipment ONLY.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Power Tools 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Hazards associated with the use of power tools include electrical shock, cuts, and particles in the eye. 
Safe tool use practices reduce or eliminate such accidents. Listed below are some of the general safety 
precautions that you should observe when your work requires the use of power tools. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Ensure that all metal-cased power tools are properly grounded. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not use spliced cables unless an emergency warrants the risks involved. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Inspect the cord and plug for proper connection. Do not use any power tool that has a frayed 
cord or broken or damaged plug. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Make sure that the on/off switch is in the OFF position before inserting or removing the plug 
from the receptacle. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Always unplug the extension cord from the receptacle before the portable power tool is 
unplugged from the extension cord. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Ensure all cables are positioned so they will not constitute a tripping hazard. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Wear eye protection (goggles) in work areas where particles may strike the eye. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• After completing a task requiring a portable power tool, disconnect the power cord as described 
above and store the tool in its assigned location. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Soldering Iron 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When using a soldering iron, remember the following: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• To avoid burns, always assume that a plugged-in soldering iron is HOT. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never rest a heated iron anywhere but in a holder provided for that purpose. Faulty action on 
your part could result in fire, extensive equipment damage, and/or serious injuries. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never use an excessive amount of solder. Drippings can cause serious skin or eye burns and can 
cause short circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not swing an iron to remove excess solder. Bits of hot solder can cause serious skin or eye 
burns or may ignite combustible material in the work area. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• When cleaning an iron, use a natural fiber cleaning cloth; never use synthetics, which melt. Do 
not hold the cleaning cloth in your hand. Always place the cloth on a suitable surface; then wipe 
the iron across it to avoid burning your hand. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Hold small soldering jobs with pliers or a suitable clamping device to avoid burns. Never hold 
the work in your hand. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not use an iron that has a frayed cord or damaged plug. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not solder electronic equipment unless the equipment is electrically disconnected from the 
power supply circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• After completing a task requiring a soldering iron other than the iron that is part of a work 
station, disconnect the power cord from the receptacle. When the iron has cooled, store it in its 
assigned stowage area. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Cleaning Solvents 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The technician who smokes while using a cleaning solvent is inviting disaster. Unfortunately, many 
such disasters have occurred. For this reason, the Navy does not permit the use of gasoline, benzine, ether, 
or like solvents for cleaning since they present potential fire or explosion hazards. Only nonvolatile 
solvents should be used to clean electrical or electronic apparatus. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to the potential hazard of accidental fire or explosion, most cleaning solvents can damage 
the human respiratory system where the fumes are breathed for a period of time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The following positive safety precautions should be followed when performing cleaning operations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Use a blower or canvas wind chute to blow air into a compartment in which a cleaning solvent is 
being used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Open all usable port holes and place wind scoops in them. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Place a fire extinguisher nearby. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• If it can be done, use water compounds instead of other solvents. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Wear rubber gloves to prevent direct contact with solvents. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Use goggles when a solvent is being sprayed on surfaces. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Hold the nozzle close to the object being sprayed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Where water compounds cannot be used, inhibited methyl chloroform (1.1.1 trichloroethane) should 
be used. Carbon tetrachloride is not used. Cleaning solvents that end with ETHYLENE are NOT safe to 
use. Methyl chloroform is an effective cleaner and is as safe as can be expected when reasonable care is 
exercised, such as adequate ventilation and the observance of fire precautions. When using inhibited 
methyl chloroform, avoid direct inhalation of the vapor. It is not safe for use, even with a gas mask, 
because its vapor displaces oxygen in the air. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Aerosol Dispensers 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A 2M technician will encounter several uses for aerosol dispensers.  The most common type is in 
applying conformal coatings. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Specific instructions concerning the precautions and procedures that must be observed to prevent 
physical injury cannot be given in this section because of the many available industrial sprays. However, 
all personnel concerned with handling aerosol dispensers containing volatile substances must clearly 
understand the hazards involved. They must also understand the importance of exercising protective 
measures to prevent personal injury. Strict compliance with the instructions printed on the aerosol </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The rules for safe use of aerosol dispensers are listed below: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Carefully read and comply with the instructions printed on the container. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not use any dispenser that is capable of producing dangerous gases or other toxic effects in 
an enclosed area unless the area is adequately ventilated. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• If a protective coating must be sprayed in an inadequately ventilated space, either an air 
respirator or a self-contained breathing apparatus should be provided. However, fresh air 
supplied from outside the enclosure by exhaust fans or portable blowers is preferred. Such 
equipment prevents inhalation of toxic vapors. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not spray protective coating on warm or energized equipment because this creates a fire 
hazard. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Avoid skin contact with the liquid. Contact with some liquids may cause burns, while milder 
exposure may cause rashes. Some toxic materials are actually absorbed through the skin. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not puncture the dispenser. Because it is pressurized, injury can result. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Keep dispensers away from direct sunlight, heaters, and other heat sources. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Do not store dispensers in an environment where the temperature exceeds the limits printed on 
the can. High temperatures may cause the container to burst.
