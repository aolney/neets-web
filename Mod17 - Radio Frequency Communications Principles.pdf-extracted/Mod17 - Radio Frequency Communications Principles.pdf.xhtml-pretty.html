</h2><p class="paragraph">When the wireless (radiotelegraph) was invented, the Navy saw a possible use for it. It could be used 
for communications from shore stations to ships along the coast. In 1899, the first official naval radio 
message was sent from ship to shore. It only traveled a distance of 20 miles but that was a start. The next 
advance was in 1916 when the Navy first used radiotelephone between ships. Three years later the first 
airborne radio was used to communicate with a ground station. In the early years, communications was 
not the best because of poor tuning techniques. Receivers often did not pick up the signal. This problem 
was almost eliminated in 1931 when the first superheterodyne receivers were installed in the fleet. In 
1944, another important event took place. The first successful radio teletypewriter transmissions between 
ships were completed. The first successful use of radiophoto (facsimile) occurred in 1945 with the 
transmission of the surrender document signing that ended World War II. Naval communications has 
grown tremendously in size and complexity since then. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The fleets of our modern Navy travel faster and are spread over greater areas of ocean than any 
seagoing force of the past. Commanders and their subordinates throughout the Department of the Navy 
use the facilities of naval communications as a primary method of communicating. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Naval communications relies on top performance from all of its assigned personnel. Reliable, secure, 
and timely transmission and receipt of information, based on wartime requirements, is the ultimate goal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Previous modules have discussed electronic components or circuitry in individual units. In this 
chapter we will tie up some loose ends for you and discuss radio-frequency communications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">We will cover the considerations involved in receiving or transmitting a radio-frequency signal 
between two or more geographic locations. Let's start by defining telecommunications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">TELECOMMUNICATIONS refers to communications over a distance and includes any 
transmission, emission, or reception of signs, signals, writings, images, or sounds. Intelligence produced 
by visual means, oral means, wire, radio, or other electromagnetic systems are also included. Electrical, 
visual, and sound telecommunications are all used in the Navy. In this chapter we will talk only about 
electrical types of telecommunications. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRICAL-1-2-">ELECTRICAL 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The types of electrical communications are radio and wire. Radio uses electromagnetic waves to 
transmit and receive intelligence. The waves are not guided by a physical path between sender and 
receiver. Wire uses conductors to carry these waves. Radio is the most important method the Navy has of 
communicating between widely separated forces. The transmission methods we will be discussing are 
radiotelegraph, radiotelephone, teletypewriter, and facsimile. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Radiotelegraph 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Radiotelegraph transmissions are referred to as continuous wave (cw) telegraphy. Cw is a manual or 
automatic system of transmitting signals using a wave of radio-frequency (rf) energy. The radio operator 
separates a continuously transmitted wave into dots and dashes based on the Morse code. This is 
accomplished by opening and closing a telegraphic hand key. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radiotelegraphy was the first means of radio communications that had military and commercial 
importance. Radiotelegraph still is used as a means of communication to, from, and among widely 
separated units of the Navy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Relative slow speed of transmission and the requirement for experienced operators are the major 
disadvantages of radiotelegraph. The main advantage is reliability. A thinking person at both sending and 
receiving stations provides a capability of being understood not present in automated systems. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Radiotelephone 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Radiotelephone is one of the most useful military communications methods. Because of its 
directness, convenience, and ease of operation, radiotelephone is used by ships, aircraft, and shore 
stations. It has many applications and is used for ship-to-shore, shore-to-ship, ship-to-ship, air-to-ship, 
ship-to-air, air-to-ground, and ground-to-air communications. Modern means of operation make it 
possible to communicate around the world by radiotelephone. One of the most important uses of 
radiotelephone is short-range tactical communications. This method permits tactical commanders to 
communicate directly with other ships. Little delay results while a message is prepared for transmission, 
and acknowledgments can be returned instantly. Radiotelephone equipment for tactical use usually is 
operated on frequencies that are high enough to have line-of-sight characteristics; that is, the waves do not </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">follow the curvature of the earth. As you know, these characteristics limit the usual range of 
radiotelephone from 20 to 25 miles. This is important because it reduces the chances of the enemy 
intercepting the message. Radiotelephone procedures can be learned easily by persons with no other 
training in communications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radiotelephone has some disadvantages. You may find transmissions unreadable because of static, 
enemy interference, or high local noise level caused by shouts, gunfire, and bomb or shell bursts. Wave 
propagation characteristics of radiotelephone frequencies sometimes are unpredictable, and tactical 
transmissions may be heard from great distances. Most radiotelephone messages are in plain language, 
and if information is to be kept from the enemy, users must keep their messages short, stick to the proper 
procedures, and be careful of what they say.

</p><p class="question">Q2. What is the main advantage of radiotelegraph communications? 
</p><p class="question">Q3. Why is radiotelephone one of the most useful methods of military communications? 
</p><p class="question">Q4. What are the disadvantages of radiotelephone communications? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Teletypewriter 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Teletypewriter (tty) signals may be transmitted by either landline (wire), cable, or radio. The landline 
tty is used both by the military services and by commercial communication companies. The Navy uses 
radio teletypewriter (rtty) mainly for high-speed automatic communications across ocean areas. The tty 
unit is equipped with a keyboard similar to a typewriter. When the operator presses a key, a sequence of 
signals is transmitted. At receiving stations, the signals are fed into terminal equipment that translates the 
sequences of signals into letters, figures, and symbols and types the messages automatically. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The rtty mode of transmission and reception is rapidly becoming more efficient and reliable for 
communications between ships and from ship-to-shore. Ships copy what is known as "fleet broadcast" 
messages on rtty. The speed at which message traffic is transmitted on rtty circuits depends on the 
equipment in use. Normal speed of operation is 100 words per minute, but it may be faster or slower. You 
may find high-speed equipment, capable of printing a line or even a page at a time, in some 
communications centers. The use of rtty has brought about a considerable savings in manpower. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Facsimile 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Facsimile (fax) is the process used to transmit photographs, charts, and other graphic information 
electronically. The image to be transmitted is scanned by a photoelectric cell. Electrical changes in the 
cell output, corresponding to the light and dark areas being scanned, are transmitted to the receiver. At the 
receiver, the signal operates a recorder that reproduces the picture. The fax signals may be transmitted 
either by landline or radio. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Facsimile transmissions suffer distortion from all of the common sources of interference experienced 
with ordinary radiotelegraph and radio teletypewriter. Certain characteristics of TIF transmission make it 
less susceptible to complete loss of intelligence. For example, picture quality will be downgraded by any 
noise bursts, since facsimile recording is a continuous recording of signals coming from a receiver. 
However, because the machine scans material at the rate of about 100 lines per inch, each line is only 
1/100th of an inch high. So you can see, if a noise burst interfers with the signal, it will distort a line only 
1/100th of an inch high, leaving the image still readable. Under similar circumstances on a conventional 
rtty circuit, such distortion could cause a portion of the page copy to be unreadable. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Facsimile transmission is not intended to be a replacement for teletypewriter and other general 
methods of transmission. It is an important communications supplement and provides a means of 
handling certain types of graphic and pictorial intelligence by swift communications methods. It is widely 
used by the Navy weather information services and ship and station weather centers to obtain the latest 
weather maps. Chances are the photo you saw in the newspaper was transmitted by facsimile.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Until recently, RADIO COMMUNICATIONS brought to mind either telegraphy (cw), voice (AM), 
or possibly radio teletypewriter (rtty) communications. Today, radio communications has become a 
highly sophisticated field of electronics. Even small Navy ships have the capability to "come up" on the 
commonly used ship-to-ship, ship-to-air, and ship-to-shore communications circuits. These circuit 
operations are accomplished through the use of compatible and flexible communications systems. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A communications system (as you will see later in this chapter) consists of two or more equipment 
sets (sets will be explained a little later). Communications systems follow the system subdivision shown 
in figure 1-1. Systems are arranged and interconnected to perform a circuit operation that cannot be 
performed by any single piece of equipment. Navy communications systems vary from the simple to the 
very complex, depending upon the circuit operations involved. Because a Navy ship must use every inch 
of available space, the communications equipment may be spread over several portions of the ship, for 
instance, receivers in one location, transmitters in another, and terminal equipment in another. The 
equipment must be installed in such a manner that it is flexible and can be used interchangeably with 
other installed communications equipment. Consequently, large numbers of sets which make up the 
shipboard communications system are installed and are capable of operating separately and 
simultaneously. Flexibility is provided through a complex arrangement of interconnections. These allow 
the physically separated equipment to be selectively switched (patched) by you into different circuit 
configurations. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">As naval electronics has grown in capability and complexity, an orderly plan of equipment 
designations has been adopted. The largest designator, system, describes equipment that work together for 
a specific function. For example, the radar system of a ship includes every item of electronics equipment 
used in or with a radar on board that ship. The smallest designator, part, describes one single piece, such 
as a bolt or a resistor. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">System 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A SYSTEM is a combination of sets, units, assemblies, subassemblies, and parts joined together to 
perform a specific operational function or several functions. Examples are communications systems, radar 
systems, or navigation systems. You will find the majority of troubleshooting done in the Navy is system 
oriented. Figure 1-2 is a pictorial view of a typical communications system containing the components 
necessary for transmission and reception of voice, telegraphy, and teletypewriter signals. Figure 1-3 is a

</p><p class="paragraph">Reference Designations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Reference designations consist of letters, numbers, or both and are used for identification purposes. 
Reference designations can be used in several different ways. One important way you will use them is as 
a cross-reference for locating supply stock numbers. When you know the reference designator, ordering 
the correct replacement for a failed component is easy. You will also use them frequently in corrective 
and preventive maintenance. Reference designators will help you to locate test points and adjustments; 
they will also help you to move back and forth between various technical manuals, schematics, tables, or 
other references. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each set within a system is assigned an AN nomenclature. Each unit, assembly, subassembly, and 
part of a set has an assigned reference designation. Systems, sets, and groups have no reference 
designation. The unit is the highest level assigned a reference designator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each unit is assigned an identifying number. This number begins with the number 1 and runs 
consecutively for all units of a system or a set. Let's look back at the radio transmitting set AN/URT-xx 
with the unit numbers 1, 2, 3 on figure 1-4. You should note that these units may also have an AN 
nomenclature, such as T-xxx/URT. The T indicates the equipment is a transmitter. The xxx would be 
replaced by 3 digits that indicate the model number. 
</p><p class="paragraph">By examining the reference designator of a unit, you will be able to determine in which group, if 
any, the unit is contained. Let's look at a complete reference designator for a unit. A good example for us 
to break down is the reference designator 2A2A3C1 on figure 1-7. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

last indicator, C1, like the two previous, is alphanumeric and refers to the part C1. We have just located 
capacitor C1 on subassembly A3, which is on assembly A2, which is in unit 2 of the equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Reference designations may be expanded or reduced to as many levels as required to identify a 
particular part. Let's look at a couple of examples on our figure. The designator 2J1 identifies jack J1, 
which is mounted directly on unit 2. The designator 2A4C3 identifies capacitor C3, which is on assembly 
A4 in unit 2.

</h3><p class="paragraph">The purpose of the EXTREMELY LOW-FREQUENCY (elf) communications system is to send 
short "phonetic letter spelled out" (PLSO) messages from operating authorities in the continental United 
States (CONUS) to submarines operating at normal mission speeds and depths. Elf has the ability to 
penetrate ocean depths to several hundred feet with little signal loss. This ability allows submarines to be 
operated well below the immediate surface and enhances submarine survivability by making detection 
more difficult. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This is a one-way communications system from the operating authority to submarines at sea. The 
large size of elf transmitters and antennas makes elf transmission from submarines impractical. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Very-Low-Frequency Communications 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The communications commitments of the Navy now cover the face of the earth. New sea frontiers to 
the north have opened a four-million-square-mile, ice-covered ocean of strategic importance. Our Navy 
must maintain control of the operating forces in an ever expanding coverage area. This additional area 
requires changes in communications capacity, range, and reliability. Additional needs have been 
particularly great in the North Atlantic and the newly opened Arctic Ocean. High-frequency circuits are 
too unreliable in these areas because of local atmospheric disturbances. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">VERY-LOW-FREQUENCY (vlf) transmissions provide a highly reliable path for communications 
in these northern latitudes as well as over and under all oceans and seas of the world. At present, 
practically all Navy vlf transmitters are used for fleet communications or navigation. The vlf transmission 
is normally considered a broadcast, that is, one-way transmission, no reply required. The vlf transmitter 
normally transmits single-channel rtty. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Vlf is currently used for communications to large numbers of satellites and as a backup to shortwave 
communications blacked out by nuclear activity. Our Navy depends on vlf for crucial communications 
during hostilities. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Secondary applications of the vlf range include worldwide transmission of standard frequency and 
time signals. Standard frequency and time signals with high accuracy over long distances have become 
increasingly important in many fields of science. It is essential for tracking space vehicles, worldwide 
clock synchronization and oscillator calibration, international comparisons of atomic frequency standards, 
radio navigational aids, astronomy, national standardizing laboratories, and communications systems. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A vlf broadcast of standard time and frequency signals has more than adequate precision for the 
operation of synchronous cryptographic devices, decoding devices, and single-sideband transmissions. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Low-Frequency Communications 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The LOW-FREQUENCY (lf) band occupies only a very small part of the radio-frequency spectrum. 
This small band of frequencies has been used for communications since the advent of radio. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Low-frequency transmitting installations are characterized by their large physical size and by their 
high construction and maintenance costs. Another disadvantage is low-frequency signal reception being 
seriously hampered by atmospheric noise, particularly at low geographical latitudes. Over the years, 
propagation factors peculiar to the low-frequency band have resulted in their continued use for radio 
communications. Low-frequency waves are not so seriously affected during periods of ionospheric 
disturbance when communications at the high frequencies are disrupted. Because of this, the Navy has a 
particular interest in the application of low frequencies at northern latitudes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Navy's requirement to provide the best possible communications to the fleet requires operation 
on all frequency bands. Constant research is being done to improve existing capabilities and to use new 
systems and developments as they become operationally reliable. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the past, the fleet broadcast system provided ships at sea with low-frequency communications via 
cw telegraph transmissions. As technology advanced, the system was converted to single-channel radio 
teletypewriter transmission. Today If communications is used to provide eight channels of frequency-
division multiplex rtty traffic on each transmission of the fleet multichannel broadcast system. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Medium-Frequency Communications 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The MEDIUM-FREQUENCY (mf) band of the radio-frequency spectrum includes the international 
distress frequencies (500 kilohertz and approximately 484 kilohertz). Some ships have mf equipment. If 
desired the distress frequencies may be monitored. When this is done the transmitter usually is kept in the 
standby position. Ashore, the mf receiver and transmitter equipment configuration is usually affiliated 
with search and rescue organizations, which are generally located near the coast. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Only the upper and lower ends of the mf band have naval use because of the commercial broadcast 
band (AM) extending from 535 to 1,605 kilohertz. Frequencies in the lower portion of the mf band (300 
to 500 kilohertz) are used primarily for ground-wave transmission for moderately long distances over </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">water and for moderate to short distances over land. Transmission in the upper mf band is generally 
limited to short-haul communications (400 miles or less). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">High-Frequency Communications 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The Navy began using HIGH FREQUENCIES for radio communications around World War I when 
only a few communications systems were operated on frequencies near 3 megahertz. When we look at the 
extensive present-day use of high frequencies for long-distance communications, the fact that those Navy 
systems were intended for very short-range communications of a few miles seems curious. The general 
belief at the time was that frequencies above 1.5 megahertz were useless for communications purposes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the prominent features of high-frequency, long-distance communications is the variable 
nature of the propagation medium. (You studied this in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave 
Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas). Successful transmission of hf signals over a long 
distance is dependent upon refraction of radio waves by layers of the ionosphere. The height and density 
of these layers is formed mainly by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. They vary significantly with the 
time of day, season of the year, and the eleven-year cycle of sunspot activity. Because of these variations, 
you must generally use more than a single frequency, sometimes up to four or five, to maintain 
communications on a circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In spite of the difficulties we encounter with hf propagation, the economic and technical advantages 
of using high frequencies have led to rapid expansion of the use of the hf band. Because the number of 
users has increased, the hf spectrum is approaching saturation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The hf band is shared by many domestic and foreign users, and only portions scattered throughout 
the band are allocated to the military services. Like other agencies, Navy requirements have grown; the 
capacity of the Navy's assigned portion of the hf spectrum has become severely taxed. The use of single-
sideband equipment and the application of independent sideband techniques have increased the capacity, 
but not enough to catch up with the demand. Some predict that satellite communications will eventually 
relieve congestion in the hf band and that, for some types of service, it will replace hf for long-distance 
communications. We will present more information to you concerning satellite communications in 
chapter 3. Even with new technology the hf spectrum most likely will continue to be in high demand for 
some time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Naval communications within the hf band can be grouped into four general types of services: point-
to-point, ship-to-shore, ground-to-air, and fleet broadcast. All but the fleet broadcast are normally 
operated with two-way communications. Some of these services involve ships and aircraft that present 
special problems because of their physical characteristics and mobility. Generally, the less than optimum 
hf performance of this shipboard equipment is at least partially offset by powerful transmitters and 
sensitive receiving systems at the shore terminals. 
</p><p class="paragraph">POINT-TO-POINT.—Point-to-point systems are established to communicate over long-distance 
trunks or links between fixed terminals. A trunk is normally a message circuit between two points that are 
both switching centers or individual message distribution points. A link is a transmitter-receiver system 
connecting two locations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Generally, enough real estate is acquired at the terminals to permit the use of large, high-gain 
antennas aimed at opposite terminals of each link. This increases the effective radiated power and the 
sensitivity of the receiving system; it also reduces susceptibility of a circuit to interference. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With the path length and direction fixed, other propagation factors are simplified and highly reliable 
communications can be achieved. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">SHIP-TO-SHORE.—This application of the hf band is more difficult than point-to-point since the 
ship is moving and constantly changing its position. In ship-to-shore the path length and direction are 
variable. Aboard ship, limited space and other restrictions prohibit installation of large, efficient hf 
antennas. Because of the mobility of ships, shipboard antennas are designed to be as nearly 
omnidirectional as possible. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Our problems are not as severe at the shore terminal where we have sufficient space for efficient 
omnidirectional antennas or arrays designed for coverage of large areas of the earth. At shore stations, 
rotatable, high-gain antennas or fixed, point-to-point antennas are used. For example, a rhombic antenna 
ashore may work well for long-haul, ship-to-shore communications when the ship is within range of the 
antenna. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Several frequencies are usually assigned for each circuit. Therefore, a frequency can be selected that 
best matches the propagation path conditions between the shore terminal and the ship. 
</p><p class="paragraph">GROUND-TO-AIR.—The use of hf radio for ground-to-air communications is similar to ship-to-
shore. The only exception is an aircraft moves more rapidly than a ship. All major circuit improvements 
must be made at the ground station. For example, higher powered transmitters, lower noise receivers, and 
more efficient antennas must be used on the ground. 
</p><p class="paragraph">FLEET BROADCASTS.—As the name implies, this service involves broadcast area coverage from 
shore-based transmitters to ships at sea. Messages to be sent to ships are delivered by various means to 
the proper broadcast station. They are then broadcast for shipboard reception. To overcome propagation 
problems, naval communicators send the messages on several frequencies at once. This is known as 
frequency-diversity transmission. This type of transmission allows the ship to choose the best frequency 
for reception. Space-diversity with physically separated receive antennas also helps to overcome this 
problem. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Very-High-Frequency and Above Communications 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Frequencies above 30 megahertz are not normally refracted by the atmosphere and ground-wave 
range is minimal. This normally limits our use of this frequency spectrum to line of sight. The exception 
to this is increased range through the use of tropospheric scatter techniques. Some communications using 
vhf and above frequencies use a technique called forward propagation by tropospheric scatter (fpts). This 
method will be discussed in more detail in chapter 5. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Certain atmospheric and ionospheric conditions can also cause the normal line-of-sight range to be 
extended. Frequencies at the lower end of this band are capable of overcoming the shielding effects of 
hills and structures to some degree; but as the frequency is increased, the problem becomes more 
pronounced. Reception is notably free from atmospheric and man-made static. (The VERY-HIGH-
FREQUENCY (vhf) and ULTRAHIGH-FREQUENCY (uhf) bands are known as line-of-sight 
transmission bands.) Because this is line-of-sight communications, the transmitting antenna is in a direct 
line with the receiving antenna and not over the horizon. The line-of-sight characteristic makes the vhf 
band ideal for amphibious operations (beach landing from sea craft) and the uhf well suited for tactical 
voice transmissions (maneuvering of ships traveling together). The SUPERHIGH-FREQUENCY (shf) 
band is used for radar and satellite communications, whereas the EXTREMELY HIGH-FREQUENCY 
(ehf) band is used only in the experimental stage.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMMUNICATIONS-FUNDAMENTALS-1-15-">COMMUNICATIONS FUNDAMENTALS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Now that we have learned the Navy's fundamental use of the various frequency bands, we should 
look at the types of communications links and their modes of operation. The Navy uses many modes of 
operation; the type used is based upon the function of the circuit or network. These modes (or functions) 
are combined to form a communications link. We will also discuss some of the actual networks the Navy 
uses on a daily basis. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMMUNICATIONS-LINKS-1-15-">COMMUNICATIONS LINKS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A complex of links forms a major communications system. The naval communications system is 
broken down into strategic and tactical groups. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Strategic 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Strategic communications are generally world-wide in nature. They are operated on a common-user 
(Navy, Army, Department of Defense, and so on) or special-purpose basis. A strategic system may be 
confined within a specified area or limited to a specific type of traffic, but the configuration is designed so 
that combined operations with other strategic systems are possible. As an example, we will look at the 
automatic voice network, automatic digital network, and the defense special security communications 
system later in this chapter. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tactical 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Tactical communications are usually limited to a specific area of operations and are used to direct or 
report the movement of specific forces. Some tactical networks are used only for operational traffic; 
others may be used for operational and administrative traffic. For instance, the task force, task-group, and 
air-control networks are ordinarily used for operational traffic. Ship-to-shore networks and broadcast 
networks serve both types of traffic. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Modes of Operation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Communications links have numerous modes of operation. In our discussion, a mode of operation is 
identified as a link or path between two or more points that is capable of providing one or more channels 
for the transmission of intelligence. Let's take a look at the five most common modes of operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SIMPLEX.—The simplex (splx) mode uses a single channel or frequency to exchange information 
between two or more terminals. Communications is in one direction only. 
</p><p class="paragraph">HALF DUPLEX.—The half-duplex (hdx) mode has one-way flow of information between 
terminals. Technical arrangements often permit transmission in either direction, but not simultaneously. 
This term must be qualified to show s/o (send only), r/o (receive only), or s/r (send or receive). 
</p><p class="paragraph">SEMIDUPLEX.—The semiduplex (sdx) uses an arrangement of equipment where one terminal is 
simplex configured and the other uses two channels or frequencies in full duplex. A clarifying example is </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">a ship in a simplex mode terminated full duplex with a shore station. The ship may send or receive but not 
do both at the same time. 
</p><p class="paragraph">FULL DUPLEX.—The full-duplex (fdx) mode is a method of operation in which 
telecommunications between stations takes place simultaneously in both directions using two separate 
frequencies. In other words, a ship may send and receive different messages at the same time. The term 
"full duplex" is synonymous with "duplex." 
</p><p class="paragraph">BROADCAST.—Broadcast (bc) is the type of operation in which one station transmits information 
on one or more channels directed to more than one station and/or unit. The broadcast system has no 
provision for receipt or reply; however, special arrangements may require the receiving station to reply or 
receipt for the message at a later time by other means. Broadcasts are the primary means of delivering 
messages to the fleet. Since Navy units copying broadcasts are not required to receipt for messages 
received, they can maintain radio silence while still receiving essential messages. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Message traffic is normally sent to the fleet by three methods: broadcast, intercept, and receipt. The 
first two are "do not answer" methods; the third, as its name implies, requires a receipt from the addressee 
(addee) for each message. Broadcast and intercept methods allow the fleet to preserve radio silence, 
which is a great advantage from the standpoint of security. By the intercept method, a shore radio station 
transmits messages to another shore station that repeats them back. Ships intercept and copy all of this 
message traffic. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Broadcast is preferable to intercept chiefly because it is faster. It is the method by which nearly all 
fleet traffic is handled. It uses radiotelegraph, radiotelephone, radio teletypewriter, and facsimile. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There is some similarity between civilian and naval broadcasts. Just as commercial stations in the 
broadcast band transmit programs to radio receivers in the homes in their communities, Navy 
communications stations broadcast messages to fleet units in their particular geographic areas. The 
resemblance between Navy and commercial stations ceases there. Information broadcast by naval 
communications stations is contained in chronologically numbered messages addressed to the ships. The 
messages are copied by the fleet units, which check the serial numbers to ensure they have a complete 
file. This checks and balances system ensures the ship has not missed any of the broadcast message 
traffic. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Fleet broadcasts follow regular schedules. Messages are placed on the schedules in order of 
precedence. If a message of higher precedence is given to a transmitter station while a lower precedence 
message is being transmitted, the latter message may be interrupted to transmit the message of higher 
precedence. All ships copy all messages appearing on the broadcast schedule they are guarding. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Messages are normally transmitted on several frequencies to make sure they are received. This gives 
the receiving station the choice of frequency selection when considering time of day and atmospheric 
conditions for best reception.

part of the DCS and are managed by the Defense Communications Agency (DCA). You should not 
confuse these DCS networks with the HICOM (high-command communications network) and NORATS 
(Navy operational radio and telephone switchboard) networks. We will discuss both of these Navy-only 
networks later in this chapter. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The DCS AUTOVON offers rapid, direct interconnection of DOD and certain other government 
installations through worldwide telephone exchanges. AUTOVON is a worldwide, general-purpose direct 
dialing telephone system. The goal of the AUTOVON system is to complete connections between two 
points anywhere in the world in about two seconds and to complete regular connections with push-button 
speed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The AUTOVON system is made up of several installations comparable in function to commercial 
telephone exchanges. An installation is referred to as an AUTOVON switch, or simply switch. Within 
individual areas we have local command, control, and administrative voice communications systems. 
These systems connect into the worldwide AUTOVON through manually operated telephone 
switchboards or automatic dial exchanges by using direct in and out dialing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Normal AUTOVON service allows your station to call other stations on a worldwide basis for day-
to-day communications by using the telephone. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Automatic Secure Voice Communications (AUTOSEVOCOM) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Another close relative to the AUTOVON system is the AUTOSEVOCOM a worldwide, switched 
telephone network. It provides authorized users with a means for exchanging classified information over 
communications security (COMSEC) circuitry or over other approved circuitry. The system consists of 
both manual and automated networks within a single system. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For subscribers to the AUTOSEVOCOM network, telephone directories containing subscriber 
listings, general instructions for placing calls, and trouble-reporting procedures are provided. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The DCS AUTODIN is a fully automatic, digital system. The system converts word messages to

</p><p class="paragraph">AUTODIN is used to furnish instantaneous, error-free, and secure communications around the world 
to several thousand directly connected subscriber terminals. Daily capacity of the system is about five-
million average-length messages. 
</p><p class="paragraph">AUTODIN switching centers are interconnected through a network of high-frequency radio 
channels, submarine cables, microwave and tropospheric channels, and a variety of wire lines. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The whole concept of AUTODIN is to reduce manual handling of messages to a minimum by the use 
of automated equipment. This system has reduced message delivery times and delay anywhere in the 
world to a matter of seconds rather than minutes or hours. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

communications network (HICOM) and the Navy operational radio and telephone switchboard 
(NORATS) networks. Let's look at some of their functions and purposes. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">High Command Communications Network (HICOM) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The HICOM network provides a voice link between the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and all 
subordinate commands ashore, afloat, and airborne. CNO is the master control station and each fleet 
commander in chief has an area network control station. All naval communications stations are members. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In cases where a fleet unit is suffering communications difficulties with normal channels, HICOM is 
used on a not-to-interfere basis to restore communications. All naval communications stations are 
required to guard HICOM for their respective area networks and use this system.

</h3><p class="paragraph">The NORATS meets our need for a connection between Navy tactical voice systems of the operating 
forces and the various fixed telephone services ashore. This system extends tactical voice to shore-based 
operational commands. NORATS provides a connecting point in the fleet center of each communication 
station. This point allows us to connect or patch all ship-to-shore voice circuits and designated local shore 
telephone systems and extensions. A combined HICOM/NORATS console exists at many naval 
communications stations.

</h2><p class="paragraph">In the previous chapter you learned the fundamentals of U.S. naval telecommunications and
communications. Now, let’s look at the equipment and systems that are used to communicate in the Navy.
The fundamental equipment used to communicate are the transmitter and receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">Transmitters and receivers must each perform two basic functions. The transmitter must generate a
radio frequency signal of sufficient power at the desired frequency. It must have some means of varying
(or modulating) the basic frequency so that it can carry an intelligible signal. The receiver must select the
desired frequency you want to receive and reject all unwanted frequencies. In addition, receivers must be
able to amplify the weak incoming signal to overcome the losses the signal suffers in its journey through
space.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TRANSMITTER-FUNDAMENTALS-2-2-">TRANSMITTER FUNDAMENTALS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Basic communication transmitters include continuous wave (cw), amplitude modulated (AM),
frequency modulated (fm), and single sideband (ssb) types. A basic description of each of these
transmitters is given in this chapter.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CONTINUOUS-WAVE-TRANSMITTER-2-2-">CONTINUOUS WAVE TRANSMITTER
</h2><p class="paragraph">The continuous wave is used principally for radiotelegraphy; that is, for the transmission of short or
long pulses of rf energy to form the dots and dashes of the Morse code characters. This type of
transmission is sometimes referred to as interrupted continuous wave. Cw transmission was the first type
of radio communication used, and it is still used extensively for long-range communications. Two of the
advantages of cw transmission are a narrow bandwidth, which requires less output power, and a degree of
intelligibility that is high even under severe noise conditions. (For example, when the receiver is in the
vicinity of rotating machinery or thunderstorms.)
</p><p class="paragraph">A cw transmitter requires four essential components. These are a generator, amplifier, keyer, and
antenna. We have to generate rf oscillations and have a means of amplifying these oscillations. We also
need a method of turning the rf output on and off (keying) in accordance with the intelligence to be
transmitted and an antenna to radiate the keyed output of the transmitter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s take a look at the block diagram of a cw transmitter and its power supply in figure 2-1. The
oscillator generates the rf carrier at a preset frequency and maintains it within close tolerances. The
oscillator may be a self-excited type, such as an electron-coupled oscillator, or a quartz crystal type,
which uses a crystal cut to vibrate at a certain frequency when electrically excited. In both types, voltage
and current delivered by the oscillator are weak. The oscillator outputs must be amplified many times to
be radiated any distance.
</p><p class="paragraph">The buffer stage or first intermediate power amplifier stage (referred to as the ipa) is a voltage
amplifier that increases the amplitude of the oscillator signal to a level that drives the power amplifier
(pa). You will find the signal delivered by the buffer varies with the type of transmitter and may be
hundreds or thousands of volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">The buffer serves two other purposes. One is to isolate the oscillator from the amplifier stages.
Without a buffer, changes in the amplifier caused by keying or variations in source voltage would vary
the load of the oscillator and cause it to change frequency. It may also be used as a frequency multiplier,
which is explained later in this text.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see in the figure, a key is used to turn the buffer on and off. When the key is closed, the
rf carrier passes through the buffer stage; when the key is open (buffer is turned off), the rf carrier is
prevented from getting through.
</p><p class="paragraph">The final stage of a transmitter is the power amplifier (referred to as the pa). In chapter 3 of NEETS,
Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, you learned that power is the product of
current and voltage (P = IE). In the power amplifier a large amount of rf current and voltage is made
available for radiation by the antenna.
</p><p class="paragraph">The power amplifier of a high-power transmitter may require far more driving power than can be
supplied by an oscillator and its buffer stage. One or more low-power intermediate amplifiers are used
between the buffer and the final amplifier that feeds the antenna. The main difference between many low-
and high-power transmitters is in the number of intermediate power-amplifier stages used.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-2 is a block diagram of the input and output powers for each stage of a typical medium-
power transmitter. You should be able to see that the power output of a transmitter can be increased by
adding amplifier stages capable of delivering the power required. In our example, the .5 watt output of the
buffer is amplified in the first intermediate amplifier by a factor of 10, (this is a times 10 [ ·  10] amplifier)
giving us an input of 5 watts to the second intermediate amplifier. You can see in this example the second
intermediate amplifier multiplies the 5 watt input to it by a factor of 5 ( ·  5) and gives us a 25 watt input to
our power (final) amplifier. The final amplifier multiplies its input by a factor of 20 ( ·  20) and gives us
500 watts of power out to the antenna.

</h2><p class="paragraph">In AM transmitters, the instantaneous amplitude of the rf output signal is varied in proportion to the
modulating signal. The modulating signal may consist of many frequencies of various amplitudes and
phases, such as the signals making up your own speech pattern.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-3 gives you an idea of what the block diagram of a simple AM transmitter looks like. The
oscillator, buffer amplifier, and power amplifier serve the same purpose as those in the cw transmitter.

energy. The driver amplifies the audio, and the modulator further amplifies the audio signal to the

amplitude-modulated signal output for transmission. In the absence of a modulating signal, a continuous

</p><h3 class="subsection">FREQUENCY MODULATED TRANSMITTER
In frequency modulation (fm) the modulating signal combines with the carrier to cause the frequency
</h3><p class="paragraph">of the resultant wave to vary with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-4 shows you the block diagram of a frequency-modulated transmitter. The modulating
signal applied to a varicap causes the reactance to vary. The varicap is connected across the tank circuit of
the oscillator. With no modulation, the oscillator generates a steady center frequency. With modulation
applied, the varicap causes the frequency of the oscillator to vary around the center frequency in
accordance with the modulating signal. The oscillator output is then fed to a frequency multiplier to
increase the frequency and then to a power amplifier to increase the amplitude to the desired level for
transmission.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Harmonics
</h3><p class="paragraph">True harmonics are always exact multiples of the basic or fundamental frequency generated by an
oscillator and are created in amplifiers and their associated circuits. Even harmonics are 2, 4, 6, and so on,
times the fundamental; odd harmonics are 3, 5, 7, and so on, times the fundamental. If an oscillator has a
fundamental frequency of 2,500 kilohertz, the harmonically related frequencies are

</h3><p class="paragraph">You should note that the basic frequency and the first harmonic are one and the same.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series ascends indefinitely until the intensity is too weak to be detected. In general, the energy in
frequencies above the third harmonic is too weak to be significant.
</p><p class="paragraph">In some electronics books, and later in this chapter, you will find the term SUBHARMONIC used. It
refers to a sine wave quantity (for example, an oscillator output) that has a frequency that is a submultiple
of the frequency of some other sine wave quantity it helped make. For example, a wave that is half the
fundamental frequency of another wave is called the second subharmonic of that wave; one with a third of
the fundamental frequency is called a third subharmonic; and so forth.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Frequency Multiplication
</h3><p class="paragraph">Designing and building a stable crystal oscillator is difficult. As operating frequencies increase, the
crystal must be ground so thin that it often cracks while vibrating. You will find that you can get around
this problem by operating the oscillators in most transmitters at comparatively low frequencies,
sometimes as low as 1/100 (.01) of the output frequency. You raise the oscillator frequency to the
required output frequency by passing it through one or more frequency multipliers. Frequency multipliers
are special power amplifiers that multiply the input frequency. Stages that multiply the frequency by 2 are
called doublers; those that multiply by 3 are triplers; and those multiplying by 4 are quadruplers.
</p><p class="paragraph">You will find the main difference between low-frequency and high-frequency transmitters is the
number of frequency-multiplying stages used. Figure 2-5 shows the block diagram of the frequency-
multiplying stages of a typical Navy uhf/vhf transmitter. The oscillator in this transmitter is tunable from
18 megahertz to 32 megahertz. You have multiplier stages that increase the oscillator frequency by a
factor of 12 through successive multiplications of 2, 2, and 3.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-6 is a block diagram of an fm transmitter showing waveforms found at various test points.
In high-power applications you often find one or more intermediate amplifiers added between the second
doubler and the final power amplifier.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SINGLE-SIDEBAND-TRANSMITTER-2-7-">SINGLE-SIDEBAND TRANSMITTER
</h2><p class="paragraph">You should remember the properties of modulation envelopes from your study of NEETS, Module
12, Modulation Principles. A carrier that has been modulated by voice or music is accompanied by two
identical sidebands, each carrying the same intelligence. In amplitude-modulated (AM) transmitters, the
carrier and both sidebands are transmitted. In a single-sideband transmitter (ssb), only one of the
sidebands, the upper or the lower, is transmitted while the remaining sideband and the carrier are
suppressed. SUPPRESSION is the elimination of the undesired portions of the signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-7 is the block diagram of a single-sideband transmitter. You can see the audio amplifier
increases the amplitude of the incoming signal to a level adequate to operate the ssb generator. Usually
the audio amplifier is just a voltage amplifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ssb generator (modulator) combines its audio input and its carrier input to produce the two
sidebands. The two sidebands are then fed to a filter that selects the desired sideband and suppresses the
other one. By eliminating the carrier and one of the sidebands, intelligence is transmitted at a savings in
power and frequency bandwidth.
</p><p class="paragraph">In most cases ssb generators operate at very low frequencies when compared with the normally
transmitted frequencies. For that reason, we must convert (or translate) the filter output to the desired
frequency. This is the purpose of the mixer stage. A second output is obtained from the frequency
generator and fed to a frequency multiplier to obtain a higher carrier frequency for the mixer stage. The
output from the mixer is fed to a linear power amplifier to build up the level of the signal for
transmission.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Suppressed Carrier
</h3><p class="paragraph">In ssb the carrier is suppressed (or eliminated) at the transmitter, and the sideband frequencies
produced by the carrier are reduced to a minimum. You will probably find this reduction (or elimination)
is the most difficult aspect in the understanding of ssb. In a single-sideband suppressed carrier, no carrier
is present in the transmitted signal. It is eliminated after modulation is accomplished and is reinserted at</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">the receiver during the demodulation process. All rf energy appearing at the transmitter output is
concentrated in the sideband energy as "talk power."
</p><p class="paragraph">After the carrier is eliminated, the upper and lower sidebands remain. If one of the two sidebands is
filtered out before it reaches the power amplifier stage of the transmitter, the same intelligence can be
transmitted on the remaining sideband. All power is then transmitted in one sideband, instead of being
divided between the carrier and both sidebands, as it is in conventional AM. This provision gives you an
increase in power for the wanted sideband. You should note in figure 2-8 that the bandwidth required for
the ssb suppressed carrier, view B, is approximately half that needed for conventional AM, view A. This
enables us to place more signals in a smaller portion of the frequency spectrum and permits a narrower
receiver bandpass.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Applications
</h3><p class="paragraph">Single-sideband transmission is the most common communications mode used today. Some of the
ssb applications used in naval communications are described for you in the following paragraphs.
</p><p class="paragraph">SSB VOICE CIRCUITS.—The high command (HICOM) network uses ssb as a means of
communications between fleet commanders; and fleet commanders use it for communications between
their subordinates and adjacent commands.
</p><p class="paragraph">Ssb is generally used whenever special voice communications circuits are necessary between shore
activities or between ships and shore activities because it is less susceptible to atmospheric interference
than amplitude modulation.
</p><p class="paragraph">SSB TELETYPEWRITER CIRCUITS.—With few exceptions, you will find ssb used on all long-
haul (great distance) teletypewriter circuits, which includes ship-to-shore. Most of these systems are
covered circuits; that is, an electronic cryptographic device on both ends of the circuit automatically
encrypts and decrypts message traffic. These devices are used on point-to-point, ship-to-shore, ship-to-
ship, and broadcast circuits.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">2-9
</p><p class="paragraph">Point-to-Point.—Most point-to-point, long-haul circuits between naval communications stations
quickly use up the available frequency spectrum that ssb provides. Independent sideband (isb)
transmission is normally used to compensate for the deficiency. Isb is used extensively in naval
communications to expand our traffic capabilities. You will find there is a similarity between ssb and isb.
Isb uses outputs from two sideband generators; it suppresses both carriers and then filters out an upper
sideband from one and a lower sideband from the other. We then combine the two remaining sidebands
and transmit an envelope with upper and lower sidebands that contain different intelligence. Isb can be
used with MULTIPLEXING (a method for simultaneous transmission of two or more signals over a
common carrier wave) to transmit a lot of intelligence on one circuit. Independent sideband and
multiplexing will be discussed in more detail in chapter 3.
</p><p class="paragraph">Ship-to-Shore.—Many ships handle enough message traffic to justify ship-to-shore teletypewriter
circuits. Depending on traffic load, these circuits may contain from one to four (minimum) teletypewriter
circuits on one sideband circuit. If the traffic load warrants more than one teletypewriter circuit, we
usually use time division multiplex or frequency division multiplex (mux) equipment. This equipment is
capable of handling many incoming and outgoing circuits. One circuit normally is used as an
ORDERWIRE CIRCUIT for operator-to-operator service messages and for making frequency changes
when necessary. The remaining circuits are available for handling official message traffic.
</p><p class="question"> Q8. Why are frequency multipliers used?
 Q9. What are two advantages of ssb transmission?
 Q10. What is the purpose of an order-wire circuit?
</p><p class="paragraph">Ship-to-Ship.—Ship-to-ship ssb teletypewriter circuits are in wide use today. Their main application
is with task force or task group networks or with several ships in company. By using this type of network,
ships can send their outgoing messages to another ship that relays traffic ashore. You can see this
procedure saves manpower and circuit time, prevents individual ships from overcrowding ship-to-shore
circuits, and conserves the frequency spectrum. Depending on the number and types of ships in company,
the guard can be shifted to other ships from time to time. A major advantage of these circuits is that
electronic cryptographic devices can be used to send classified messages without need for manual
encryption. These circuits are used for incoming as well as outgoing traffic, and they can use either hf or
uhf communications equipment.

</h2><p class="paragraph">An AM receiver processes amplitude-modulated signals received by its antenna. It delivers an output
that is a reproduction of the signal that originally modulated the rf carrier at the transmitter. The signal
can then be applied to some reproducing device, such as a loudspeaker, or to a terminal device, such as a
teletypewriter. Actual AM receivers vary widely in complexity. Some are very simple; others contain a
large number of complex circuits.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Reception
</h3><p class="paragraph">Reception occurs when a transmitted electromagnetic wave passes through the receiver antenna and
induces a voltage in the antenna.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Selection
</h3><p class="paragraph">Selection is the ability of the receiver to select a particular frequency of a station from all other
station frequencies appearing at the antenna of the receiver.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Detection
</h3><p class="paragraph">Detection is the action of separating the low (audio) frequency intelligence from the high (radio)
frequency carrier. A detector circuit is used to accomplish this action.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Reproduction

interpreted by your ear as speech, music, and the like. An example of this might be the stereo speakers in

</h2><p class="paragraph">Sensitivity, noise, selectivity, and fidelity are important receiver characteristics. These characteristics
will be useful to you when performing receiver tests. They can help you to determine whether a receiver
is working or not or in comparing one receiver to another.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Sensitivity
</h3><p class="paragraph">The ability of a receiver to reproduce weak signals is a function of the sensitivity of a receiver. The
weaker a signal that can be applied to a receiver and still produce a certain value of signal output, the
better the sensitivity rating. Sensitivity of a receiver is measured under standardized conditions. It is
expressed in terms of the signal voltage, usually in the microvolts that must be applied to the antenna
input terminals to give an established level of the output. The output may be an ac or dc voltage measured
at the detector output or a power measurement (measured in decibels or watts) at the loudspeaker or
headphone terminals.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Noise
</h3><p class="paragraph">All receivers generate a certain amount of noise, which you must take into account when measuring
sensitivity. Receiver noise may originate from the atmosphere (lightning) or from internal components
(transistors, tubes). Noise is the limiting factor of sensitivity. You will find sensitivity is the value of input
carrier voltage (in microvolts) that must be applied from the signal generator to the receiver input to
develop a specified output power.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Selectivity
</h3><p class="paragraph">Selectivity is the degree of distinction made by the receiver between the desired signal and unwanted
signals. You will find the better the ability of the receiver to reject unwanted signals, the better its
selectivity. The degree of selection is determined by the sharpness of resonance to which the frequency-
determining circuits have been engineered and tuned. You usually measure selectivity by taking a series
of sensitivity readings. As you take the readings, you step the input signal along a band of frequencies
above and below the circuit resonance of the receiver; for example, 100 kilohertz below to 100 kilohertz</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">above the tuned frequency. As you approach the tuned frequency, the input level required to maintain a
given output level will fall. As you pass the tuned frequency, the required input level will rise. Input
voltage levels are then compared with frequency. They can be plotted on paper or you might view them
on an oscilloscope. They would appear in the form of a response curve. The steepness of the response
curve at the tuned frequency indicates the selectivity of the receiver.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Fidelity
</h3><p class="paragraph">The fidelity of a receiver is its ability to accurately reproduce, in its output, the signal that appears at
its input. You will usually find the broader the band passed by frequency selection circuits, the greater
your fidelity. You may measure fidelity by modulating an input frequency with a series of audio
frequencies; you then plot the output measurements at each step against the audio input frequencies. The
resulting curve will show the limits of reproduction.
</p><p class="paragraph">You should remember that good selectivity requires that a receiver pass a narrow frequency band.
Good fidelity requires that the receiver pass a broader band to amplify the outermost frequencies of the
sidebands. Receivers you find in general use are a compromise between good selectivity and high fidelity.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The superheterodyne is the type receiver most familiar to you. You probably see one daily in your
home in the form of an AM and/or fm radio. We will discuss the basic workings of both AM and fm types
and their differences.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Amplitude Modulation Receiver
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-9 shows a block diagram with waveforms of a typical AM superheterodyne receiver
developed to overcome the disadvantages of earlier type receivers. Let’s assume you are tuning the
receiver. When doing this you are actually changing the frequency to which the rf amplifier is tuned. The
rf carrier comes in from the antenna and is applied to the rf amplifier. The output of the amplifier is an
amplified carrier and is sent to the mixer. The mixer also receives an input from the local oscillator. These
two signals are beat together to obtain the IF through the process of heterodyning. (Heterodyning will be
further discussed later in this chapter and was covered in NEETS, Module 12, Modulation Principles.) At
this time you should note the dotted lines connecting the local oscillator, rf amplifier, and the mixer. This
is used on block diagrams and schematics to indicate GANGED TUNING. Ganged tuning is the process
used to tune two or more circuits with a single control. In our example, when you change the frequency of
the receiver all three stages change by the same amount. There is a fixed difference in frequency between
the local oscillator and the rf amplifier at all times. This difference in frequency is the IF. This fixed
difference and ganged tuning ensures a constant IF over the frequency range of the receiver.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The IF carrier is applied to the IF amplifier. The amplified IF carrier is then sent to the detector. The
output of the detector is the audio component of the input signal. This audio component is then passed
through an audio frequency amplifier. The amplified audio component is sent to a speaker for
reproduction. This allows you to hear the signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">You should note that a superheterodyne receiver may have more than one frequency-converting
stage and as many amplifiers as needed to obtain the desired power output. (Additional amplifiers are not
shown.)
</p><p class="paragraph">HETERODYNING.—As you know the intermediate frequency is developed by a process called
heterodyning. This action takes place in the mixer stage (sometimes called a converter or first detector).
Heterodyning is the combining of the incoming signal with the local oscillator signal. When heterodyning
the incoming signal and the local oscillator signal in the mixer stage, four frequencies are produced. They
are the two basic input frequencies and the sum and the difference of those two frequencies. The amplifier
that follows (IF amplifier) will be tuned to the difference frequency. This difference frequency is known
as the intermediate frequency (IF). A typical value of IF for an AM communications receiver is 455
kilohertz. The difference frequency is a lower frequency than either the rf input or oscillator frequencies.
This lower frequency gives slightly better gain but does increase the chances of image frequency
interference. Image frequencies will be discussed later in this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">DETECTION.—Once the IF stages have amplified the intermediate frequency to a sufficient level,
it is fed to the detector. When the mixer is referred to as the first detector, this stage would be called the
second detector. The detector extracts the modulating audio signal. The detector stage consists of a
rectifying device and filter, which respond only to the amplitude variations of the IF signal. This develops
an output voltage varying at an audio-frequency rate. The output from the detector is further amplified in
the audio amplifier and is used to drive a speaker or earphones.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Frequency Modulated Receiver
</h3><p class="paragraph">The function of a frequency-modulated receiver is the same as that of an AM superheterodyne
receiver. You will find some important differences in component construction and circuit design caused
by differences in the modulating technique. Figure 2-10 is a block diagram showing waveforms of a
typical fm superheterodyne receiver. Comparison of block diagrams in figures 2-9 and 2-10 shows that in
both AM and fm receivers, the amplitude of the incoming signal is increased in the rf stages. The mixer</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">combines the incoming rf with the local oscillator signal to produce the intermediate frequency, which is
then amplified by one or more IF amplifier stages. You should note that the fm receiver has a wide-band
IF amplifier. The bandwidth for any type of modulation must be wide enough to receive and pass all the
side-frequency components of the modulated signal without distortion. The IF amplifier in an fm receiver
must have a broader bandpass than an AM receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">Sidebands created by fm differ from the AM system. You should recall that the AM system consists
of a single set of side frequencies for each radio-frequency signal modulated. An fm signal inherently
occupies a wider bandwidth than AM because the number of extra sidebands that occur in an fm
transmission is directly related to the amplitude and frequency of the audio signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">You should observe that only two fundamental sections of the fm receiver are electrically different
from the AM receiver. These are the discriminator (detector) and the limiter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Beyond the IF stage, the two receivers have a marked difference. AM demodulation involves the
detection of variations in the amplitude of the signal; fm demodulation is the process of detecting
variations in the frequency of the signal. In fm receivers a DISCRIMINATOR is a circuit designed to
respond to frequency shift variations. A discriminator is preceded by a LIMITER circuit, which limits all
signals to the same amplitude level to minimize noise interference. The audio frequency component is
then extracted by the discriminator, amplified in the af amplifier, and used to drive the speaker.
</p><p class="paragraph">ADVANTAGES.—In normal reception, fm signals are almost totally absent of static while AM
signals are subject to cracking noises and whistles. Fm followed AM in development and has the
advantage of operating at a higher frequency where a greater amount of frequencies are available. Fm
signals provide much more realistic sound reproduction because of an increase in the number of
sidebands. This increase in the number of sidebands allows more of the original audio signal to be
transmitted and, therefore, a greater range of frequencies for you to hear.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see, fm requires a wide bandpass to transmit signals. Each transmitting station must be
assigned a wide band in the fm frequency spectrum. During fm transmissions, the number of significant</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">sidebands that must be transmitted to obtain the desired fidelity is related to the deviation (change in
carrier’ frequency) divided by the highest audio frequency to be used. At this point you may want to
review chapter 2 of NEETS, Module 12, Modulation Principles. For example, if the deviation is 40
kilohertz and the highest audio frequency is 10 kilohertz, the modulation index is figured as shown below:
</p><p class="paragraph">In this example, a modulation index of 4 equates to 14 significant sidebands. Because the audio
frequency is 10 kilohertz and there are 14 side-bands, the bandwidth must accommodate a 140-kilohertz
signal. You can see this is considerably wider than the 10-to-15-kilohertz bandpass used in AM
transmitting.
</p><p class="paragraph">FREQUENCY CONVERSION.—Frequency conversion is accomplished by using the heterodyne
principle of beating two frequencies together to get an intermediate frequency. So far, you have only
become familiar with single conversion; however, some receivers use double or triple conversion. These
methods are sometimes referred to as double or triple heterodyning. Receivers using double or triple
conversion are very selective and suppress IMAGE SIGNALS to yield sharp signal discrimination.
(Image signals are undesired, modulated carrier signals that differ by twice the intermediate frequency
from the frequency to which the superheterodyne receiver is tuned.) Double and triple conversion
receivers also have better adjacent channel selectivity than can be realized in single conversion sets.
</p><p class="paragraph">In military communications receivers you may sacrifice fidelity to improve selectivity. This is
permitted because intelligence (voice, teletypewriter) can be carried on a fairly narrow band of
frequencies. Entertainment receivers, on the other hand, must reproduce a wider band of frequencies to
achieve their high-fidelity objective.

only one sideband of an AM signal and retain the information transmitted. Now you will see how a
single-sideband signal is received.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Advantages
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-11 illustrates the transmitted signal for both AM and ssb. Ssb communications has several
advantages. When you eliminate the carrier and one sideband, all of the transmitted power is concentrated
in the other sideband. Also, an ssb signal occupies a smaller portion of the frequency spectrum in
comparison to the AM signal. This gives us two advantages, narrower receiver bandpass and the ability to
place more signals in a small portion of the frequency spectrum.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Ssb communications systems have some drawbacks. The process of producing an ssb signal is
somewhat more complicated than simple amplitude modulation, and frequency stability is much more
critical in ssb communication. While we don’t have the annoyance of heterodyning from adjacent signals,
a weak ssb signal is sometimes completely masked or hidden from the receiving station by a stronger
signal. Also, a carrier of proper frequency and amplitude must be reinserted at the receiver because of the
direct relationship between the carrier and sidebands.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-12 is a block diagram of a basic ssb receiver. It is not significantly different from a
conventional superheterodyne AM receiver. However, a special type of detector and a carrier reinsertion
oscillator must be used. The carrier reinsertion oscillator must furnish a carrier to the detector circuit. The
carrier must be at a frequency which corresponds almost exactly to the position of the carrier used in
producing the original signal.

</p><p class="paragraph">Rf amplifier sections of ssb receivers serve several purposes. Ssb signals may exist in a small portion
of the frequency spectrum; therefore, filters are used to supply the selectivity necessary to adequately
receive only one of them. These filters help you to reject noise and other interference.
</p><p class="paragraph">Ssb receiver oscillators must be extremely stable. In some types of ssb data transmission, a frequency
stability of – 2 hertz is required. For simple voice communications, a deviation of – 50 hertz may be
tolerable.
</p><p class="paragraph">These receivers often employ additional circuits that enhance frequency stability, improve image
rejection, and provide automatic gain control (agc). However, the circuits contained in this block diagram
are in all single-sideband receivers.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Carrier Reinsertion
</h3><p class="paragraph">The need for frequency stability in ssb operations is extremely critical. Even a small deviation from
the correct value in local oscillator frequency will cause the IF produced by the mixer to be displaced
from its correct value. In AM reception this is not too damaging, since the carrier and sidebands are all
present and will all be displaced an equal amount. Therefore, the relative positions of carrier and
sidebands will be retained. However, in ssb reception there is no carrier, and only one sideband is present
in the incoming signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">The carrier reinsertion oscillator frequency is set to the IF frequency that would have resulted had the
carrier been present. For example, assume that a transmitter with a suppressed carrier frequency of 3
megahertz is radiating an upper sideband signal. Also assume that the intelligence consists of a
1-kilohertz tone. The transmitted sideband frequency will be 3,001 kilohertz. If the receiver has a
500-kilohertz IF, the correct local oscillator frequency is 3,500 kilohertz. The output of the mixer to the IF
stages will be the difference frequency, 499 kilohertz. Therefore, the carrier reinsertion oscillator
frequency will be 500 kilohertz, which will maintain the frequency relationship of the carrier to the
sideband at 1 kilohertz.
</p><p class="paragraph">Recall that 1 kilohertz is the modulating signal. If the local oscillator frequency should drift to
3,500.5 kilohertz, the IF output of the mixer will become 499.5 kilohertz. The carrier reinsertion
oscillator, however, will still be operating at 500 kilohertz. This will result in an incorrect audio output of
500 hertz rather than the correct original 1-kilohertz tone. Suppose the intelligence transmitted was a
complex signal, such as speech. You would then find the signal unintelligible because of the displacement
of the side frequencies caused by the local oscillator deviation. The local oscillator and carrier reinsertion
oscillator must be extremely stable.

RECEIVER CONTROL CIRCUITS
</p><p class="paragraph">This section deals with circuits that control receiver functions. We will explain how some of the
basic manual and automatic receiver control functions work.
</p><p class="paragraph">Manual Gain Control (mgc)
You learned previously that high sensitivity is one of the desirable characteristics of a good receiver.
</p><p class="paragraph">In some cases high sensitivity may be undesirable. For example, let’s suppose the signals received from a
nearby station are strong enough to overload the rf sections of your receiver. This may cause the audio
output to become distorted to the point of complete loss of intelligibility. To overcome this problem, you
can use manual gain control of the rf section. By using the manual gain control, you can adjust the

illustrated in figure 2-13. Let’s go through the basic circuitry.
</p><p class="paragraph">C1 is an emitter bypass capacitor. Resistors R1 and R2 develop emitter bias for the amplifier. C2
provides dc isolation between the tank and the base of transistor Q1. You should recall from your studies
of NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, and Module 8,
Introduction to Amplifiers, that amplifier gain may be varied by changing bias. Potentiometer R2, the rf
gain control, is nothing more than a manual bias adjustment. When the wiper arm of R2 is set at point B,
minimum forward bias is applied to the transistor. This causes the amplifier to operate closer to cutoff and
reduces gain. When you move the control toward point A, the opposite occurs. R1 limits the maximum
conduction of Q1 when R2 is short circuited. You may run into an alternate biasing method when the
transistor is operated near saturation. In that case, a large change in gain would again be a function of
bias.

applied to the audio amplifier. R1, R2, and R3 develop forward bias and set the operating point for the

Potentiometer R1 in the circuit shown causes the input impedance of the stage to remain fairly constant.

</p><p class="paragraph">Automatic Gain/Volume Control (agc/avc)
Output volume variations of a receiver often result from variations in the input signal strength.
</p><p class="paragraph">Changes in input signal strength occur when we change stations or when we experience fading because of
changing atmospheric conditions. The function of an AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL, also referred to
as an AUTOMATIC VOLUME CONTROL, is to limit unwanted variations in the output of the receiver
caused by variations in strength of the received signal input. A receiver without agc would require
continuous manual readjustment to compensate for received signal changes so that it could maintain a
constant output level.
</p><p class="paragraph">Signals from stations operating at the same power level may not reach the receiver antenna with the
same power. This is because of differences in transmission distances, carrier frequencies, atmospheric
conditions, and obstructions between the transmitter and receiver antennas.
</p><p class="paragraph">You might draw the conclusion that an agc network is not necessary when the receiver is operating
on a single station. However, this is not true; atmospheric conditions may cause the signal strength to vary
(fade in and out), or the antenna may receive components of the signal which have traveled along
different paths. For example, one component may travel directly from the antenna, and another may have
been reflected from a distant object. The two signals will sometimes be in phase and at other times be out
of phase, thus tending to reinforce or cancel each other. The result is a variation in signal strength at the
receiver antenna. This variation in signal strength is often referred to as FADING. The effect of fading in
the output signal voltage of an rf stage is best demonstrated by the following example: An rf amplifier
connected to a receiving antenna has a voltage gain of 100. If the antenna receives an input signal of 10
microvolts, the output voltage is computed as follows:

</p><p class="paragraph">When the 10-microvolt original signal and the 5-microvolt reflected signal are out of phase with each
other, the signal strength at the receiving antenna will decrease to 5 microvolts. If we want to maintain
our original 1,000-microvolt output signal, the voltage gain of the amplifier must be increased as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">A variation of amplifier gain, similar to the example, is necessary if we are going to compensate for
input signal strength variations. The required amplifier gain variations can be accomplished automatically
by the addition of an agc circuit within the receiver. Let’s take a look at the methods and circuits used to
produce agc and the manner in which agc (avc) controls receiver gain.
</p><p class="paragraph">CIRCUITRY.—Figure 2-15 is a block diagram representing agc feedback to preceding stages. The
detector circuit has a dc component in the output that is directly proportional to the average amplitude of
the modulated carrier. The agc circuitry uses this dc component by filtering the detector output to remove
the audio and IF components and by applying a portion of the dc component to the preceding stages. This
agc voltage controls the amplification of any or all of the stages preceding the detector stage. Solid-state
receivers may use either positive or negative voltage for agc. The type of transistors used and the
elements to which the control voltage is applied determine which type we will have.
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit shown in figure 2-16 produces a positive agc voltage. Transformer T1, diode CR1,
capacitor C1, and resistor R1 comprise a series diode detector. The agc network is made up of R2 and C2.
With normal detector operation and the positive (+) potential shown at the input, CR1 conducts.
Conduction of the diode will cause a charging current (shown by the dashed line) to flow through agc
capacitor C2 and agc resistor R2. This charging current develops a voltage across C2. When the potential
across T1 reverses, the diode will be reverse biased and will not conduct. When this happens, the charging
current ceases and C2 begins to discharge. The discharge path for C2 is shown by the solid arrows. The</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">discharge path time constant of C2, R1, and R2 is chosen to be longer than the period (1/f) of the lowest
audio frequency present in the output of the detector. Because of the longer time constant, C2 will not
discharge much between peaks of the modulating signal, and the voltage across C2 will be essentially a dc
voltage. This voltage is proportional to the average signal amplitude. Now, if the signal strength varies,
C2 will either increase or decrease its charge, depending on whether the signal increases or decreases.
Since the charge on the agc capacitor responds only to changes in the average signal level, instantaneous
variations in the signal will not affect the agc voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">You should remember that, depending on transistor types, the receiver may require either a positive
or a negative agc voltage. A negative agc voltage could be easily obtained by reversing CR1. Once the
values for R2 and C2 have been selected, the voltage divider action of the components is fixed, and the
circuit operates automatically without further adjustment. If the average amplitude of the signal increases,
the charge on C2 will also increase. If the signal amplitude decreases so does the charge on C2.
</p><p class="paragraph">The agc voltages in a receiver provide controlled degenerative feedback. By adjusting the operating
point of an amplifier, you can control the gain. Under no-signal conditions, bias of the rf and IF amplifiers
is developed by standard means, such as self bias. With an applied signal, an agc voltage is developed,
which in conjunction with normal biasing methods develops the operating bias for the amplifiers.
</p><p class="paragraph">TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIER GAIN.—You have seen how a dc voltage that is obtained at the
output of the agc network is proportional to, and will reflect, the average variations of the average signal
level. Now all we have to do is use this agc voltage to control the amplification of one or more of the
preceding amplifiers. Figure 2-17 illustrates a common-emitter amplifier with agc applied to the base
element. A change in the agc voltage will change the operating point of the transistor and the dc emitter
current. In this circuit, R1 and R4 form a voltage divider and establish no-signal (forward) bias on the
base. Since a pnp transistor is used, the base has a negative potential. The agc voltage from the detector is
positive with respect to ground and is fed to the base through dropping resistor R2. You will find when
the dc output of the detector increases (because of an increase in the average signal level) the agc voltage
will become more positive. This increased positive potential is applied to the base of Q1, which decreases
the forward bias of Q1 and decreases the gain of the amplifier. Agc, in this application, works with</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

increases conduction, which in turn drives the transistor to or near saturation. As the transistor approaches
saturation, its gain is correspondingly reduced.
</p><p class="paragraph">On the other hand, if the input signal level decreases, the negative agc voltage decreases. The
forward bias is then reduced, and the transistor operates on a lower portion of its characteristic curve
where gain is higher.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Delayed Automatic Gain Control
</h3><p class="paragraph">The disadvantage of automatic gain control, attenuating even the weak signal, is overcome by the use
of delayed automatic gain control (dagc). Let’s take a look at the typical dagc circuitry in figure 2-19. This
type of system develops no agc feedback until an established received signal strength is attained. For
signals weaker than this value, no agc is developed. For sufficiently strong signals, the delayed agc circuit
operates essentially the same as ordinary agc.
</p><p class="paragraph">Our circuit uses two separate diodes; one is the detector diode and the other the agc diode. The agc
diode is connected to the primary of the last IF transformer and the detector diode to its secondary. A
positive bias is applied to the cathode of the agc diode. This keeps it from conducting until a prearranged
signal level has been reached. The adjust delay control allows manual control of the agc diode bias.
Manual control allows you to select the signal level at which agc is applied. If mostly weak stations are to</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

as low as possible to prevent overloading of the last IF amplifier by stronger signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">Finally, you must have two diodes to obtain delayed agc. If only one diode were used, the agc would
be developed from the detector diode, and there would be no delayed action. Or, if a signal diode were
biased to provide the delaying action desired, no signal would pass to the audio amplifier until the bias
was exceeded by the input signal.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Beat-Frequency Oscillator
</h3><p class="paragraph">The beat-frequency oscillator (bfo) is necessary when you want to receive cw signals. Cw signals are
not modulated with an audio component, you remember, so we must provide one. The action of the rf
amplifier, mixer, local oscillator, and IF amplifier is the same for both cw and AM; but the cw signal
reaches the detector as a single frequency signal with no sideband components. To produce an af output,
you must heterodyne (beat) any cw signal with an rf signal of the proper frequency. This separate signal is
obtained from an oscillator known as a beat-frequency oscillator.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-20 is a block diagram of a superheterodyne receiver capable of receiving and demodulating
a cw signal. The bfo heterodynes at the detector and produces an af output. The detector (second detector)
is used primarily because the mixer (first detector) is normally used as the source of agc.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the intermediate frequency is 455 kilohertz and the bfo is tuned to 456 kilohertz or 454 kilohertz,
the difference frequency of 1 kilohertz is heard in the output. Generally, you will tune the bfo from the
front panel of a receiver. When you vary the bfo control, you are varying the output frequency of the bfo
and will hear changes in the tone of the output audio signal.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Squelch
</h3><p class="paragraph">The sensitivity of a receiver is maximum when no signal is being received. This condition occurs, for
example, when a receiver is being tuned between stations. At this time background noise is picked up by
the antenna, and you will hear noise greatly amplified. This noise is highly annoying and occurs because
receiver gain is maximum without a signal. You can often overcome this problem by using a circuit called
a SQUELCH, NOISE SILENCER, NOISE SUPPRESSOR, or NOISE LIMITER. All of these noise type
circuits just clip the peaks of the noise spikes. Squelch will actually eliminate noise. Figure 2-21 is a</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

accomplishes this by blocking either the detector or audio amplifier when no signal is present. Let’s take a
look at the theory involved in this process.
</p><p class="paragraph">The squelch diode CR1 connects the output of the first af stage to the input of the second. Amplifier
Q1 serves as the control transistor for the circuit. The anode and cathode voltages of CR1 are normally
biased positive with respect to ground.
</p><p class="paragraph">With no input signal, R9 is adjusted until Q1 draws enough collector current to reduce its collector
voltage and the anode voltage of CR1 to a value below the voltage on the cathode of CR1. At this point
the anode voltage of the squelch diode is negative with respect to its cathode, and conduction ceases.
Audio output is now reduced to zero and the receiver is silent.
</p><p class="paragraph">The base of Q1 is connected to the automatic volume control (avc) line. Anytime a signal enters the
receiver, a negative avc voltage is applied to the base of Q1. This reduces the collector current and
increases the collector voltage, which in turn increases the anode voltage of CR1 until the anode becomes
positive with respect to the cathode. Once again diode CR1 will conduct, and the signal will be passed to
the second af amplifier. Diode CR1 is effectively a switch controlled by the avc voltage.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Audio Tone
</h3><p class="paragraph">The tone of the sound reproduced in the audio section of a receiver depends on several factors. The
frequency response of the audio amplifiers determines the degree of amplification provided to different
frequencies in the sound spectrum. The size and quality of any loudspeaker used will determine its
response to various frequencies. Response of the human ear is the final judge of tonal quality, and that
varies with the individual.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of these variables, some form of tone control is sometimes used in Navy receivers. Treble
tones are defined as the audio frequencies above approximately 3,000 hertz and bass tones are those
below approximately 300 hertz. Although several methods of tone control can be used, we are only going
to mention the attenuation method. With this method, a decrease in the intensity of one tone can produce
an apparent increase in the intensity of another tone. As an example, let’s look at tones of 400 and 4,000
hertz produced by a speaker with the same intensity. If we reduce the intensity of the 4,000-hertz tone, the
400-hertz tone will appear to be louder, even though its intensity has not actually changed. You should
see from this example that bass emphasis can be accomplished by attenuating treble tones.
</p><p class="paragraph">The simplest type of tone control is illustrated in figure 2-22. Fixed capacitor C1 parallels the
primary winding of the output transformer, effectively shunting the higher frequencies to ground. The size
of C1 determines the lowest frequency to be affected. When you select the BASS position of the tone
control, C1 is connected and improves bass response by de-emphasizing the treble tones. You can often
use this circuit to improve the output of a small speaker with poor treble response.
</p><p class="paragraph">A continuously variable tone control is illustrated in figure 2-23. Tone control R1 and bypass
capacitor C1 act as a variable RC filter. With the wiper arm of R1 in the upper (BASS) position, C1
bypasses the higher frequencies to ground and provides better bass response. When the wiper arm of R1 is
in the lower (TREBLE) position, the resistance of R1 is placed in series with C1, which reduces the
shunting effect of C1 to high frequencies and improves the treble response. This method gives you the
advantage of smooth, continuous tone control at all points between maximum bass and maximum treble
response.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A switch-type, variable tone control is illustrated in figure 2-24. With this method we use a three-
position switch to provide fixed degrees of tone control. When tone control S1 is in the BASS position,
capacitor C1 bypasses the high frequencies and provides bass emphasis. With S1 in the normal (NORM)
position, C2 acts as the bypass, and a moderate amount of high-frequency attenuation is accomplished.
This position provides balanced bass and treble response. When S1 is in the TREBLE position, C3 acts as
the bypass and provides minimum high-frequency attenuation and maximum treble emphasis. As a rule of
thumb, you can figure the capacitance of C2 is approximately five times the value of C3, and C1 is
approximately ten times the value of C3. For example with C3 at .001 microfarads, C2 would be .005
microfarads, and C1 would be .01 microfarads.

understanding this circuit. You can see a crystal in one leg of the bridge circuit. The secondary of the
input transformer (T1) is balanced to ground through the center tap connection. The crystal acts as a high
Q series resonant circuit. It allows signals within the immediate vicinity of resonance to pass through the
crystal to the output coil (L3). The desired signal appears between the center tap of L3 and ground.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">Afc circuits are used in situations where you must accurately control the frequency of an oscillator
by some external signal. Basically, this type circuit does two things: It senses the difference between the
actual oscillator frequency and the frequency that is desired and produces a control voltage proportional
to the difference; it also uses the control voltage to change the oscillator to the desired frequency. Afc
circuits are used to control the frequency of sinusoidal oscillators and nonsinusoidal oscillators. Only
sinusoidal afc circuits will be covered here. Afc circuits are used in radio receivers, fm transmitters, and
frequency synthesizers to maintain frequency stability. Figure 2-26 is a block diagram illustrating afc
operation in a receiver. Let’s run through the applicable parts of this block diagram.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The frequency discriminator controls the varicap in this receiver. A varicap is used to keep the IF
stable. You may want to review varicap theory in chapter 3 of NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-
State Devices and Power Supplies at this point. The varicap application here produces an apparent
reactance, which is included in the oscillator frequency control circuitry. For example, let’s assume the IF
is 455 kilohertz and the local oscillator (lo) is tracking below the incoming station. When the lo output
decreases slightly in frequency, the IF will rise. This causes the output of the discriminator to increase the
capacitive reactance of the varicap, which increases the oscillator frequency to the desired value. Now
let’s assume the lo output increases. The IF will then decrease. This causes the discriminator output to
decrease the capacitive reactance of the varicap. This will cause the oscillator frequency to decrease.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-27 shows another widely used type of afc and its circuitry. This type is commonly referred
to as a BALANCED-PHASE DETECTOR or PHASE-DISCRIMINATOR. This circuit uses fixed
capacitors and the varying conductance of the diodes to achieve a variable reactance. As you have seen in
the block diagram, an afc circuit requires two sections, a frequency detector and a variable reactance. Our
detector output is a dc control voltage proportional to the amount of frequency change. This dc voltage is
applied directly to the oscillator. The phase inverter input signals are discriminated IF outputs fed to the
two diodes 180 degrees out of phase.
</p><p class="paragraph">A reference voltage is also applied to both diodes. The diodes are biased to conduct only during the
peak portions of the input signals. Any change in oscillator frequency will alter the phase relationship

any change in frequency is instantaneously corrected. The network between the diodes and oscillator is
essentially a low-pass filter. This filter prevents discriminator pulses from reaching the oscillator.
</p><h3 class="subsection">FREQUENCY SYNTHESIS
In present day communications systems, long term accuracy of one part in a million is required from
</h3><p class="paragraph">many of the frequency generators (local oscillators) used in communications equipment. Variable
frequency oscillators cannot practically achieve this high degree of stability. Therefore, a system known
as FREQUENCY SYNTHESIS has been developed to meet the stringent demands for stability. This
system uses circuitry that produces a signal frequency through a heterodyning and frequency selection
process. This signal is not harmonically related to any of the signals used in the heterodyning process. It
is also not related to the selected crystal frequency. This makes the signal unique.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-28 is a multiple crystal, frequency synthesizer that produces desired output frequencies by
mixing frequencies from several crystal oscillators. Each oscillator uses ten or more crystals to control its
operating frequency. This provides for a large number of output frequency combinations. Figure 2-29 is a
practical frequency synthesizer in which the harmonics and subharmonics of a single standard oscillator
are combined to provide a wide multichoice of output signals. Each of these signals is harmonically
related to a subharmonic of the standard oscillator. You will find the primary difficulty encountered in the
frequency synthesizers is the presence of spurious signals generated in the "combining mixers." Extensive
filtering and extremely careful selection of operating frequencies are required for even the simplest
circuits. Spurious frequency problems increase and channel spacing decreases as the range of operating
frequencies increases.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The purpose of audio reproduction devices, such as loudspeakers and headphones, is to convert
electrical audio signals to sound power. Figure 2-30 shows you a diagram of a loudspeaker called the
PERMANENT MAGNET SPEAKER. This speaker consists of a permanent magnet mounted on soft iron
pole pieces, a voice coil that acts as an electromagnet, and a loudspeaker cone connected to the voice coil.
The audio signal has been previously amplified (in terms of both voltage and power) and is applied to the
voice coil. The voice coil is mounted on the center portion of the soft iron pole pieces in an air gap so that
it is mechanically free to move. It is also connected to the loudspeaker cone; as it moves, the cone will
also move. When audio currents flow through the voice coil, the coil moves back and forth proportionally
to the applied ac current. As the cone (diaphragm) is attached to the voice coil, it also moves in
accordance with the signal currents; in so doing, it periodically compresses and rarefies the air, which
produces sound waves.

</p><p class="paragraph">Most speakers of the above type receive their input by means of transformer coupling. This is
necessary because of the normal, low impedance of the voice coil. You will find the standard impedance
values for this type speaker are 4, 8, 16, and 32 ohms. Other impedance values may be obtained, but those
listed are the most common.
</p><p class="paragraph">While permanent magnet speakers perform reasonably well in the audio range, they have limitations.
Most Navy speakers reproduce low audio frequencies quite well, mid-band frequencies fairly well, and
high frequencies quite poorly. Let’s see why. When the speaker is constructed, only a limited number of
turns may be built into the voice coil. This gives us a fixed inductance. At low frequencies, the inductive
reactance of the voice coil is relatively low, and large audio currents flow. This provides a strong
magnetic field around the voice coil and a strong interaction with the field of the permanent magnet. Low
frequency response is excellent. At midband frequencies, inductive reactance increases and less current
flows in the voice coil. This produces less magnetic field and less interaction. Midband response is still
acceptable in a properly designed speaker. At high audio frequencies inductive reactance is quite high,
and little current flows in the voice coil. This results in a greatly reduced voice coil field and little
interaction with the permanent magnetic field. Also at high frequencies the interwinding capacitance of
the voice coil tends to shunt some of the high audio frequencies, which further reduces the high frequency
response.
</p><p class="paragraph">Frequency response of most permanent magnet speakers falls off at the higher audio frequencies.
This problem is normally overcome either by the use of an expensive, specially designed speaker, or
through the use of two speakers, one of which is designed to operate well at the higher audio frequencies
(tweeter) and one at the lower frequencies (woofer).
</p><p class="paragraph">As shown in figure 2-31, an electromagnet may be used in place of a permanent magnet to form an
electromagnetic dynamic speaker. When we do this, sufficient dc power must be available to energize the
field electromagnet. The operation otherwise is much the same as that of the permanent magnet type. This
type of speaker is seldom used in Navy equipment.

of a permanent magnet and two small electromagnets through which the signal currents pass. A soft iron
diaphragm is used to convert the electrical effects of the device into sound power. When no signal
currents are present, the permanent magnet exerts a steady pull on the soft iron diaphragm. Signal current
flowing through the coils mounted on the soft iron pole pieces develops a magnetomotive force that either
adds to or subtracts from the field of the permanent magnet. The diaphragm thus moves in or out
according to the resultant field. Sound waves are then reproduced that have an amplitude and frequency
(within the mechanical capability of the reproducer) similar to the amplitude and frequency of the signal
currents.
</p><p class="paragraph">As compared to permanent magnet speakers, standard headphones are considered to be high-
impedance devices. Headphone electromagnets are normally wound with many turns of small wire, which
provide the larger impedance. Because of the physically small size and inflexibility of the metal
diaphragm, the headphones often give poor response to the lower audio frequencies. In the voice range of
audio, most standard issue headphones are adequate.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Radio Transmitting Set 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The applications, configurations, and components you will become familiar with here are typical of 
most general purpose transmitter systems used in the Navy. A specific transmitter is used only for ease of 
illustration and example. 
</p><p class="paragraph">We will be discussing a 1,000 watt, single-sideband radio transmitting set that is available to the 
Navy in any one of four setups. The normal configuration has a transmitter capable of voice, continuous 
wave, and radio teletypewriter transmissions in the 2- to 30-megahertz frequency range. Exact spacing 
and number of channels available within the frequency spectrum, modes of operation, and frequency 
range depend on the model of equipment and how it is configured for use. Stack or rack mounting is used 
in a ship or shore permanent installation with accessory equipment (for example an rf amplifier, coupler 
control unit, or power supply) to form a complete communications system. One of three different three-
phase primary power sources can be used (depending on whether the transmitter is land, air, or shore 
based) to provide operating power to the set. Combinations available are 115 volts, 400 hertz; or 208/440 
volts, 60 hertz. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">General Description 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-5 shows the major units of this set. They are the radio transmitter, the radio frequency 
amplifier, the power supply, and the electrical equipment shock mount base. An antenna coupler group 
(consisting of a coupler and coupler control unit) is normally used to match the impedance of the system 
to a 50-ohm transmission line. If you want to operate with any 50-ohm antenna system, terminating 
connections are available.

</p><p class="paragraph">The transmitter unit provides an upper sideband (usb), lower sideband (lsb), independent sideband 
(isb), cw, fsk, or compatible AM signal. The output of the transmitter has enough power to drive the radio 
frequency amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Depending on the model, the transmitter tunes across the frequency range in 100- or 500-hertz 
increments. Digital circuitry is used to accomplish this process. Transmitter outputs are also applied to the 
rf amplifier to automatically tune it to the correct frequency. We will go through a detailed breakdown of 
the transmitter unit later in this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RADIO FREQUENCY AMPLIFIER.—The rf amplifier unit is a two-stage linear power amplifier 
that produces an output of 1,000 watts with a nominal input of 100 milliwatts. Nineteen frequency bands 
are used to cover the operating frequency range. The operating band is automatically selected by digital 
coding generated by the transmitter. The code controls two motor-driven band switch assemblies. 
Automatic control circuits protect the unit against overload and compensate for variations in system gain, 
mode of operation, and loading. 
</p><p class="paragraph">All low voltages required for operation (except two of the relay control voltages) are internally 
produced. The high voltages required in the amplifier stages are produced by the associated power supply 
(when using 60 hertz primary power) or the optional internally mounted power supply (when using 400 
hertz primary power). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's take a look at figure 3-6 to see all the operating controls and indicators located on the front 
panel. Some controls are used only for initial setup and are protected by a hinged access cover. All 
connections are made at the rear of the case. The amplifiers and the associated interstage broadband 
transformer assemblies are cooled by forced ventilation. Cooling air is drawn through a filter on the front 
panel and exhausted through a port on the rear of the case. You should always take particular care to clean 
or replace any filter in electronic equipment as a regular part of your preventive maintenance program. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">POWER SUPPLIES.—One power supply produces operating voltages for the amplifier when 
operating from a 60-hertz power source. All components of the power supply, except the power 
transformers, are mounted on a chassis and panel assembly that is hinge-mounted to a metal case. The 
power transformers are constructed as part of the case and there are no operating controls. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The other power supply produces operating voltages for the rf amplifier when a 400-hertz, three-
phase, 115-volt primary power source is used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">ANTENNA COUPLER GROUP.—The antenna coupler group is an automatic antenna tuning 
system. However, the equipment design includes provisions for manual or semiautomatic tuning. This 
makes the system adaptable for use with other radio transmitters. The manual tuning capability is useful 
when a failure occurs in the automatic tuning circuitry. Tuning can also be accomplished without the use 
of rf power (SILENT TUNING). This method is useful in installations where radio silence must be 
maintained except for brief transmission periods. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The antenna coupler matches the impedance of a 15-, 25-, 28-, or 35-foot whip antenna to a 50-ohm 
transmission line at any frequency in the 2- to 30-megahertz range. Control signals from the associated 
antenna coupler control unit automatically tune the matching network in less than five seconds. During 
manual and silent operation, tuning is accomplished by the operator with the controls mounted on the 
antenna coupler control unit. A low power (not to exceed 250 watts) cw signal is required for tuning. 
Once tuned, the coupler is capable of handling 1,000 watts peak envelope power (pep). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The coupler is enclosed in an aluminum, airtight, pressurized case. Six mounting feet enable the unit 
to be attached to the mast of a ship at the base of a whip antenna. The coupler is pressurized with dry 
nitrogen to aid internal heat transfer and to prevent corona and arcing. All components of the coupler are 
secured to a chassis that is mounted to the case so that an air duct exists between the chassis plate and the </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

through the air duct. While passing through the air duct, the nitrogen loses its heat to the bottom of the 
case. This heat is then transferred by convection through fins on the bottom of the case and by conduction 
through the mounting feet. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-7 shows the antenna coupler control unit. This unit provides the power and control signals 
required to tune the coupler. Control signals are either automatically produced by the coupler control 
when a tune cycle is initiated or manually produced with the front panel controls. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

</p><p class="paragraph">All dc operating voltages are produced from a 115-volt, 48- to 63- or 350- to 450-hertz, single-phase

from the remotely positioned coupler control unit.

radio transmitter accepts audio or coded intelligence and uses it to modulate one of 280,000 possible 
operating radio frequencies in the 2.0- to 29.999-megahertz frequency range. Tuning is accomplished 
digitally by means of five control knobs and a switch located on the front panel. The transmitter has a 
normal rf output level of at least 100 milliwatts and is designed to be used with an associated rf power 
amplifier. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When the AM and ssb transmit modes of operation are used, the output from a handset is applied to 
the transmitter. The voice signals are amplified and used to modulate a 500-kilohertz local carrier that 
produces a 500-kilohertz IF. The resulting double sideband signal is filtered in the AM mode, amplified, 
and converted by a triple-conversion process to the desired rf operating frequency. The rf signal is 
amplified to a nominal 100 milliwatt level. In cw operation, the 500-kilohertz local carrier is inserted 
directly into the IF amplifiers. The signal is further processed in the same manner as the voice signals in 
the AM or ssb modes of operation. In fsk operation, the loop current is converted to audio frequencies 
representing marks and spaces. These audio signals are applied to the audio circuits of the transmitter. 
Thereafter, these signals are processed in the same manner as the voice signals in AM or ssb modes of 
operation. A typical radio transmitting set block diagram is shown in figure 3-9. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The receiver we will discuss is a triple-conversion superheterodyne, tunable from 2 to 30 megahertz. 
Triple conversion uses three IF frequencies to give better adjacent-channel selectivity and greater image-
frequency suppression. Figure 3-10 shows the front panel of this receiver where tuning is done digitally 
by five controls and a switch. A display window directly above each control provides a digital readout of 
the frequency setting. The displayed frequency can be changed in 1-kilohertz increments. The front panel 
switch allows the operating frequency to be changed in 100- or 500-hertz increments depending on the 
model. This will provide you with 280,000 discrete frequencies locked to a very accurate frequency 
standard. You can continuously tune each 1,000-hertz increment by selecting the VERNIER position of 
the hertz switch. When using the vernier, the full accuracy of the frequency standard is sacrificed. The

inch rack. Each piece of distribution equipment is fitted with termination or patch fittings designed for 
ease of connecting and disconnecting. A basic patch panel is shown in figure 3-11. Even a fundamental 
distribution system has several antenna transmission lines and several receivers. Normally a patch panel 
consists of two basic patch panels. One panel is used to terminate the antenna transmission lines and the 
other the lines leading to the receivers. Any antenna can be patched to any receiver through the use of 
patch cords.

However, because of the higher power levels, design and fabrication problems are more difficult. The

high-power patch cords are expensive, large, and difficult to handle, this approach is seldom followed.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BASIC-PRINCIPLES-3-15-">BASIC PRINCIPLES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">To give you an idea of how intelligence is sent via teletypewriter, let's take a look at the manual 
telegraph circuit. This circuit, shown in figure 3-16, includes a telegraph key, a source of power (battery), 
a sounder, and a movable sounder armature. If the key is closed, current flows through the circuit and the 
armature is attracted to the sounder by magnetism. When the key is opened, the armature is retracted by a 
spring. With these two electrical conditions of the circuit, intelligence can be transmitted by means of a 
teletypewriter code. These two conditions of the circuit are referred to as MARKING and SPACING. The 
marking condition occurs when the circuit is closed and a current flows; the spacing condition occurs 
when it is open and no current flows.

combination for the letter R. Shaded areas show intervals during which the circuit is closed, and the blank 
areas show the intervals during which the circuit is open. The signal has a total of seven units. Five of 
these are numbered and are called INTELLIGENCE units. The first and last units of the signal are labeled 
START and STOP. They are named after their functions: the first starts the signal, and the last stops it.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Codes 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Two of the codes the Navy uses are found in manual telegraphy and in teletypewriter operation. One 
is very easy to understand while the other is more complex. Let's look at these two types and how they 
work. 
</p><p class="paragraph">MANUAL TELEGRAPHY.—In manual telegraphy, the most widely used code is the Morse code. 
In this code, two distinctive signal elements are employed-the dot and the dash. The difference between a 
dot and a dash is its duration, a dash being three times as long as a dot. Each character is made up of a 
number of dots and/or dashes. The dot and dash elements making up any character are separated from 
each other by a time interval equal to the duration of one dot. The time interval between the characters for 
each word is equal to the duration of three dots. The interval between words is equal to seven dots. (A 
signal-man uses the Morse code to send visual flashing-light messages. The radioman uses the Morse 
code to send messages electrically.) 
</p><p class="paragraph">TELETYPEWRITER MESSAGE TRANSMISSION.—In teletypewriter operation, the code 
group for each character is of uniform length. Since the Morse code is an uneven length code, it cannot be 
used in teletypewriter operation without additional code converters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The FIVE-UNIT (five-level) CODE has been the most commonly used in modern printing 
telegraphy and is universally used in teletypewriter operation. This is also known as the Baudot code. The 
mechanical sending device in the teletypewriter divides the sending time for each character into five short 
code elements (impulses) of equal duration. The five-unit code is an example of what is called an even 
length or constant length code (one in which the number of signal elements for a character is the same for 
every character and the duration of each element is constant). In the five-unit code, each character 
consists of a combination of five signal elements; each element may be either a mark or a space. A total 
of thirty-two combinations of signal elements are possible with this arrangement. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The thirty-two possible combinations available from the five-unit code are insufficient to handle the 
alphabet and numbers since twenty-six combinations are required for the letters of the English alphabet 
alone. This leaves only six combinations for numerals, symbols, or nonprinting functions. This number of 
combinations is obviously inadequate; therefore, two of the thirty-two combinations are used as shift 
signals. The shift signals are often referred to as case-shift signals (one case is a letter shift, and the other 
a figure shift.) These two shift signals permit the remaining code combination to be used as letter-shift 
signals for letters and as figure-shift signals for numerals, function signs, and so forth. When a letter shift 
is transmitted, it sets the receiving instrument in a condition to recognize any letter signal combination. It 
will recognize letter combinations until a figure shift is received. Then the receiving instrument sets itself 
in a condition to recognize any figure signal combination received. The interpretation of a signal 
combination is determined by the previous shift signal. This plan enables 30 of the 32 available 
combinations to have two meanings. 
</p><p class="question">Q14. There are not enough combinations of the five-unit code to handle the alphabet, symbols and so 
forth. What is used to increase the number of available code combinations? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Modes of Operation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The two basic modes of teletypewriter operation are ASYNCHRONOUS (start-stop) and 
SYNCHRONOUS. The most common mode used in teletypewriter operation is the start-stop mode. 
Synchronous operation is used more in high-speed data systems. Let's examine their differences. 
</p><p class="paragraph">ASYNCHRONOUS.—In the start-stop mode of operation, the receiving device is allowed to run for 
only one character. It is then stopped to await the reception of a start signal indicating the next character is </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">3-18 
</p><p class="paragraph">about to start. In this manner any difference in speed between the transmitting and receiving devices can 
accumulate only during the duration of one character. However, you should note that a penalty must be 
paid for this advantage. The length of each character must be increased to include a unit (element) to start 
the receiving device and another to stop it. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The start unit precedes the first intelligence unit and is always a space signal. Its purpose is to start 
the receiving machine. The stop unit follows the last code unit and is always a mark signal. Its purpose is 
to stop the receiving machine in preparation for receiving the next character. The start unit must be equal 
to at least one unit of the code. The standard mode uses a stop unit that is 1.42 times the length of one 
intelligence unit. It is common practice to refer to a code unit as an element and to use the terms 
interchangeably. You will also hear duration of a unit referred to as the unit interval. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The length of time required to transmit the entire character is called the CHARACTER INTERVAL. 
Character interval becomes very important in some transmissions because certain items of equipment are 
character length conscious or code conscious. Stop unit intervals of various lengths are used or produced 
by various equipment (1.0, 1.27, 1.5, 1.96, 2.0, and so forth). Basically, the only difference between them 
is the length of time required to transmit one character. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SYNCHRONOUS.—Synchronous teletypewriter operation does not in all cases have to rely upon 
elements of the transmitted character to maintain proper position in relation to the receiving device. 
External timing signals may be used that allow the start and stop elements to be discarded. You will then 
see only the elements necessary to convey a character. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Synchronous systems have certain advantages over asynchronous systems. The amount of time taken 
to transmit stop and start elements is made available for information transmission rather than for 
synchronizing purposes. Only the intelligence elements are transmitted. In start-stop signaling, the ability 
of the receiving device to select the proper line signal condition is dependent upon signal quality. For 
example, suppose the stop-to-start transition arrives before it should; then, because of atmospherics, all 
subsequent selection positions in that character will appear earlier in time in each code element. A 
synchronous system has a higher capability for accepting distorted signals because it does not depend on a 
start-stop system for synchronization. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Modulation Rate 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Several terms are used to refer to teletypewriter modulation rates or signaling speeds. These include 
BAUD RATE, BITS PER SECOND, and WORDS PER MINUTE. Baud is the only term that is 
technically accurate. The other terms are either approximations or require explanation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The word baud by definition is a unit of modulation rate. You will sometimes see it used to refer to a 
signal element, but this reference is technically incorrect. Baud rate is the reciprocal of the time in 
seconds of the shortest signal element. To find the modulation rate of a signal in bauds, you must divide 
the number 1 by the time duration of the shortest unit interval present in the signal. For example, 22 
milliseconds (.022 seconds) is the time interval of the shortest unit in the five-unit code at 60 words per 
minute. To find the number of bauds corresponding to 60 words per minute, divide 1 by .022. Rounding 
off the result of the division gives us the number 45.5, which is the baud equivalent of 60 words per 
minute. Each increase in words per minute will correspondingly decrease the signal unit time interval. 
(The defense communications system standard speed for teletypewriter operation is 100 words per minute 
or 75 baud.) 
</p><p class="paragraph">Words per minute is used only when speaking in general terms for an approximation of speed. The 
term 100 words per minute means 100 five letter words with a space between them can be transmitted in a 
60-second period. However, you can obtain this nominal words-per-minute rate in several systems by </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">varying either modulation rate or the individual character interval (length). For this reason, the 
modulation rate (baud) method of reference rather than words per minute is used. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Formula for baud rate and words per minute are as follows 
</h3><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">BIT is an acronym for the words binary digit. In binary signals, a bit is equivalent to a signal 
element. Because of the influence of computer and data processing upon our language, modulation rate is 
sometimes expressed in bits per second. When you understand all signal elements being transmitted are of 
equal length, then the modulation rate expressed in bits per second is the same as the modulation rate 
expressed in baud. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Dc Circuits 
</h3><p class="paragraph">You were told the two conditions mark and space may be represented by any convenient means. The 
two most common are NEUTRAL and POLAR operation. In neutral, current flow represents the mark, 
and no current flow represents the space; in polar operation, current impulses of one polarity represent 
mark, and impulses of the opposite polarity of equal magnitude represent the space. 
</p><p class="paragraph">NEUTRAL.—Neutral circuits make use of the presence or absence of current flow to convey 
information. A neutral teletypewriter circuit is composed of a transmitting device, a battery source to 
supply current, a variable resistor to control the amount of current, a receiving device, and a line for the 
transmission medium. 
</p><p class="paragraph">POLAR.—Polar operation differs from neutral operation in two ways. Current is always present in 
the polar system, and it is either positive or negative. A polar teletypewriter circuit contains the same 
items as a neutral circuit plus an additional "battery" source. The battery referred to here is not an actual 
battery but is a solid-state dc power supply. It provides variable current to the teletypewriters. The reason 
for having an extra battery source is because polar circuits use positive battery for marks and negative 
battery for spaces. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You will find in polar operation that the distortion of a signal is almost impossible through low line 
currents, high reactance, or random patching of signal circuits or equipment. In polar signaling when you 
experience a complete loss of current (a reading of zero on a milliammeter), you know you have line or 
equipment trouble; whereas the same condition with neutral signaling may indicate a steady space is 
being transmitted. This gives us a condition called RUNNING OPEN. Under this condition, the 
teletypewriter appears to be running because the machines is decoding the constant space as the Baudot 
character blank and the type hammer continually strikes the type box but there is no printing or type box 
movement across the page.

exchange of information between them is direct. When the teletypewriters are not physically joined, 
exchange of information is more involved. Direct-current mark and space intervals cannot be sent through 
the air. The gap between the machines must be bridged by radio using a radio transmitter and receiver. 
The transmitter produces a radio frequency carrier wave to carry the mark and space intelligence. A 
KEYER is needed to change the dc pulses from the tty into corresponding mark and space modulation for 
the carrier wave in the transmitter. The radio receiver and a CONVERTER are required to change the 
radio frequency signal back to dc pulses. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Radio Teletypewriter Systems

SYSTEM, referred to as audio-frequency tone shift (afts), and the CARRIER-FREQUENCY SHIFT 
SYSTEM, referred to as radio-frequency-carrier shift (rfcs). The rfcs system is also called frequency-shift

provides a source of radio-frequency excitation. Figure 3-22 illustrates a basic frequency-shift keyed 
system. In modern systems, the keyer is built into the transmitter. The keyer shifts the signal box below or 
above the assigned frequency to correspond with the mark or space required to transmit tty characters. 
Normally the keyer is adjusted for an 850-hertz spread, 425 hertz above and 425 hertz below the assigned

</p><p class="paragraph">TELETYPEWRITER SETS.—Most of the teletypewriter sets used by the Navy belong to one 
family of tty equipment. This equipment features various weights and sizes, quiet operation, and high 
operating speeds. They present relatively few maintenance problems. Because of this they are well suited 
for severe shipboard conditions of roll, vibration, and shock. 
</p><p class="paragraph">These teletypewriters operate at various speeds. Conversion from one speed to another is usually 
only a matter of changing the gears that are located within the equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Teletypewriters may be send/receive units or receive only units. They may be designed as floor 
models, table models, or rack and wall-mounted sets. The teletypewriter shown is a send/receive floor 
model. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The teletypewriter receives messages and prints them on page-size copy paper. In addition, it can 
receive and record messages on perforated tape. You can use the keyboard or perforated tape to send 
messages. Page print monitoring is available with both methods. The set shown can prepare perforated 
and printed tape for separate transmission. It does this with or without simultaneous transmission and 
page-print monitoring. The combinations of services available are extensive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The tty set may include a CABINET, KEYBOARD, PAGE PRINTER, TYPING PERFORATOR, 
TRANSMITTER DISTRIBUTOR, TYPING REPERFORATOR, power distribution panels, and a power 
supply. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In operation, the components are linked by electrical or mechanical connections. You are given a

The typing perforator and typing reperforator are devices for preparing tapes on which locally initiated or 
incoming tty messages can be stored for future transmission through the td. 
</p><p class="paragraph">COMMUNICATION PATCHING PANELS.—Ttys are provided flexibility by jacks that are used 
to terminate all ttys and associated equipment. The jacks are wired in communications patching panels, 
usually referred to as tty patch panels. You are able to connect any combination of equipment electrically 
by means of patch cords. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The plugs on the patch cords are inserted into the jacks at the front of the panel. These plugs have 
three different parts. They are the tip, ring, and sleeve. The tip carries the intelligence signal while the 
ring carries the synchronizing (step) or timing signals. The sleeve carries an alarm signal that indicates 
(both visually and audibly) a problem to the operator. The problem may be equipment failure, loss of loop 
current, or improper patching. Commonly used combinations of equipment are often wired together 
within the panel (called normal-through). Individual pieces of equipment are wired on jacks to allow you 
to use them alone or in combination. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Tty patch panels also furnish a central point for connecting the dc voltage supply into the tty circuits. 
One source of supply can be used for all circuits passing through a particular panel. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RED and BLACK are used on patch panels to identify whether that panel is used for passing secure 
or nonsecure information. Red indicates that secure (encrypted) information is being passed through the 
panel. Black indicates that nonsecure (unencrypted) information is being passed. Patch panels through 
which secure information is passed are indicated by a red sign on the front that has inch high white block 
letters that say "RED PATCH PANEL." Panels through which nonsecure information is passed are 
indicated by two black signs on the front with inch high white block letters. One sign says "BLACK 
PATCH PANEL" and the other "UNCLAS ONLY." 
</p><p class="paragraph">Each panel contains six channels. Each channel has its own series circuit of looping jacks, set jacks, 
and a rheostat for adjusting line current. The number of looping and set jacks in each channel varies with 
the panel model. Each panel includes a meter and rotary selector switch for measuring the line current in 
any channel. There are six miscellaneous jacks. Any tty equipment not regularly assigned to a channel, 
may be connected to one of these jacks. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the desired tty equipment is wired in the same looping channel as the radio adapter used, no 
patching is required. But, if the desired tty is not wired in the same looping channel as the keyer or 
converter, it must be patched. For example, let's put a tty on channel 1 and a converter on channel 3. If 
you want to receive, you must insert one end of the patch cord in the set jack for channel 1 and the other 
end in either one of the two looping jacks of channel 3. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In any switching operation between the plugs and jacks of a tty panel, the cord plug must be pulled 
from the looping jack before you remove the other plug from the set (machine) jack. Pulling the plug 
from the set jack first opens the circuits to the channel, causing all tty messages in the channel to be 
interrupted.

</p><p class="paragraph">REMOTE TRANSMITTER CONTROL UNIT.—The remote transmitter-control unit is mounted 
close to the kybd and permits remote control of the transmitter (xmtr). It has a transmitter power on-off 
switch, a power-on indicator lamp, a carrier-on indicator lamp, and a three-position rotary selector switch. 
For rfcs operation you set the switch to CFS SEND to transmit and to CFS REC to receive. Use the

equipment. The comparison is in the form of LISSAJOUS PATTERNS. A lissajous pattern is a 
combined, simultaneous display of the amplitude and phase relationships of two input signals. One signal 
is applied to the vertical and the other to the horizontal deflection circuits. Lissajous patterns have many 
applications in electronics. They have operational uses as well as uses in corrective and preventive 
maintenance. Further coverage on lissajous patterns can be found in NEETS, Module 19, The

transceiver through the transmitter transfer switchboard. The audio tone-shift signals modulate the rf 
carrier generated by the transmitter (xmtr). The rf tone-modulated signals are then radiated by the 
antenna. 
</p><p class="paragraph">On the receive side, the rf tone-modulated signals are received at the antenna. You then patch the 
signal via the multicoupler to the receiver section of the transceiver. Demodulation takes place at this 
point. The resulting audio tone-shift signals are then patched through the receiver transfer switchboard. 
The signals now go from the switchboard to the tone terminal set, where they are converted back to dc 
signals. The dc signals are then patched through the communication patching panel to the tty for printing. 
</p><p class="paragraph">TONE TERMINAL SET.—In tone modulation transmission, the tty pulses are converted into 
corresponding audio tones. These tones amplitude modulate the rf carrier in the transmitter. Conversion to 
audio tones is accomplished by an audio oscillator in the tone converter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An internal relay in the tone converter closes the control line to the transmitter. This keys the 
transmitter on the air when the operator begins typing a message. The transmitter remains keyed until 
after the message has been transmitted. 
</p><p class="paragraph">On the receive side, the tone converter accepts the mark and space tones coming in from a receiver 
and converts them into signals suitable to operate a relay in the converter. The make and break contacts of 
the relay are connected in the local tty dc loop circuit. This causes the teletypewriter to print in unison 
with the mark and space signals from the distant tty. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Multiplexing Equipment 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The number of communications networks in operation throughout any given area is increasing. As a 
result, all areas of the rf spectrum have become highly congested. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The maximum number of intelligible transmissions taking place in the radio spectrum is being 
increased through the use of MULTIPLEXING. Multiplexing is the simultaneous transmission of a 
number of intelligible signals (messages) in either or both directions using only a single rf carrier. You 
may use two methods of multiplexing. These are TIME-DIVISION and FREQUENCY-DIVISION. 
</p><p class="paragraph">TIME-DIVISION.—With AM voice and tone communications, we want to transmit and receive for 
360 degrees of each sine wave. However, an audio signal may be transmitted and received satisfactorily 
by periodically sampling the signal. The sampling process yields a received signal like the one shown in 
figure 3-28. There is no limit to the maximum number of samples that may be made, but you must sample 
at least twice per cycle of audio to get satisfactory results. In practical systems, 2.4 samples per cycle are 
usually taken. This concept of sampling forms the basis for time-division multiplex (tdm) operation. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the transmitter and receiver switches are synchronized, the signals will be fed in the proper 
sequence to the receiver channels. The samples from transmitter channel one will be fed to receiver 
channel one. In this way, many channels of audio are combined to form a single output (multiplexed) 
chain. Time spacing occurs between the components of the separate channels. The chain is transmitted 
(via wire or radio path) to distant demultiplexing receivers. Each receiving channel functions to select and 
reconstruct only the information included in the originally transmitted channel. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In most present day applications, electronic switching is used as the sampling component. The main 
advantage to electronic sampling is the longer life of an electronic switch when compared to an 
electromechanical switch. We use a mechanical system in our example to make this concept easier for 
you to see. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now let's look at figure 3-29, view B, where channel one is shown sampled four times. (This is the 
output of channel one in our transmitter.) Figure 3-29, view C, shows all six channels being sampled four 
times during each cycle. (This is the output of the rotating switch in our transmitter.) What you see here is 
a continuous, time-sharing waveform. 
</p><p class="paragraph">More than six channels (perhaps 24 or more) may be used. As we increase the number of channels, 
the width of each sample segment must be reduced. The problem with reducing the width of the pulse is 
that the bandwidth (bw) necessary for transmission is greatly increased. Decreasing the pulse width 
decreases the minimum required rise time of the sampling pulse and increases the required bandwidth. 
When you increase the number of channels, you increase the bw. The bw is also affected by the shape of 
the sampling pulse and the method used to vary the pulse. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

(pam), PULSE WIDTH or PULSE DURATION MODULATION (pwm or pdm), PULSE POSITION 
MODULATION (ppm), and PULSE CODE MODULATION (pcm). We have been studying an example 
of pulse amplitude modulation. (These methods of tdm were discussed in NEETS, Module 12, 
Modulation Principles.) 
</p><p class="paragraph">FREQUENCY DIVISION.—Frequency division multiplexing (fdm), unlike tdm, transmits and 
receives for the full 360 degrees of a sine wave. Fdm used presently by the Navy may be divided into two 
categories. One category is used for voice communications and the other for tty communications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The normal voice speaking range is from 100 to 3,500 hertz. During single channel AM voice 
communications, the audio frequency amplitude modulates a single rf (carrier frequency). However, in 
voice fdm, each voice frequency modulates a separate frequency lower than the carrier frequency 
(subcarrier frequency). If these subcarrier frequencies are separated by 3,500 hertz or more, they may be 
combined in a composite signal. This signal modulates the carrier frequency without causing excessive 
interference. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-30, the output of channel one is the voice frequency range of 100 to 3,500 hertz. The 
output of channel two is the combination of a different voice frequency with a subcarrier frequency of 
4,000 hertz. The output of channel three is another voice frequency. This voice frequency combined with 
a subcarrier frequency of 8,000 hertz gives you an output frequency range of 8,100 to 11,500 hertz. The 
overall bw for the composite modulation package shown is 100 to 15,500 hertz. Each separate channel 
occupies its own band of frequencies. The composite signal is used to modulate the carrier frequency of 
the transmitter. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Multichannel broadcast and ship/shore terminations use tty fdm. With this system, each channel of 
the composite tone package of the broadcast is assigned an audio frequency. By multiplexing tty circuits, 
up to 16 circuits may be carried in any one of the 3,000 hertz multiplexed channels described above. 
Don't confuse the two types of multiplexing. In the first case, 3,000 hertz audio channels have been 
combined. In the second case, a number of dc tty circuits are converted to tone keying and combined in a 
single 3,000-hertz audio channel. Figure 3-31 illustrates a 16-channel, tty-multiplexing system. The 
output of the dc pulsed circuits is converted to audio keying. Each channel has a separate audio center 
frequency. Channel frequencies range from 425 hertz for the lowest channel to 2,975 hertz for the highest </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Facsimile 
</h3><p class="paragraph">FACSIMILE (fax) is a method of transmitting still images over an electrical communications 
system. The images, called "pictures" or "copy" in fax terminology, may be weather maps, photographs, 
sketches, typewritten or printed text, or handwriting. Figure 3-32 shows a facsimile transceiver. You must 
realize that the still image serving as the fax copy or picture cannot be transmitted instantly in its entirety. 
Three distinct operations are performed. These are (1) scanning, (2) transmitting, and (3) recording or 
receiving. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Scanning consists of subdividing the picture in an orderly manner into a large number of segments. 
This process is accomplished in the fax transmitter by a scanning drum and phototube arrangement. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The picture you want to transmit is mounted on a cylindrical scanning drum. This drum rotates at a 
constant speed and at the same time moves longitudinally along a shaft. Light from an exciter lamp 
illuminates a small segment of the moving picture and is reflected by the picture through an aperture to a 
phototube. During picture transmission, the light crosses every segment of the picture as the drum slowly 
spirals past the fixed lighted area. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of light reflected back to the phototube is a measure of the lightness or darkness of the 
segment of the picture being scanned. The phototube changes the varying amounts of light into electrical 
signals. These are used to amplitude modulate the constant frequency output of a local oscillator. The 
modulated signal is then amplified and sent to the radio circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Signals received by the fax receiver are amplified and actuate a recording mechanism. This recorder 
makes a permanent recording (segment by segment) on paper. The paper is attached to a receiver drum 
similar to the one in the fax transmitter. The receiver drum rotates synchronously with the transmitter 
drum. Synchronization of the receiver and transmitter is done to reduce distortion. Synchronization is 
obtained by driving both receiver and transmitter drums with synchronous motors operating at the same 
speed. Drum rotation continues until the original picture is reproduced. The recording mechanism may 
reproduce the picture photographically by using a modulated light source shining on photographic paper 
or film. It may also reproduce directly by burning a white protective coating from specially prepared 
black recording paper. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The receiver drum is FRAMED with respect to the transmitter drum by a series of phasing pulses 
that are transmitted just before transmission. The pulses operate a clutch mechanism that starts the </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Transmission security includes all measures designed to protect transmission from interception, 
traffic analysis, and imitative deception. Every means of transmission is subject to interception. In radio 
transmission, it should be assumed that all transmissions are intercepted. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Speed Versus Security 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Three fundamental requirements of a military communications system are reliability, security, and  
speed. Reliability is always first. Security and speed are next in importance and, depending on the stage of 
an operation, are interchangeable. During the planning phase, security is more important than speed. 
During the execution phase, speed sometimes passes security in importance. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Radio Transmission Security 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When a message is transmitted by radio, the originator may know some of those who are receiving it, 
but will never know  all of those who are receiving the message. You must assume that an enemy receives 
every transmission. Property prepared messages using modern cryptographic systems may prevent an 
enemy from understanding a message. However, they can still learn a lot. For example, as time for a 
planned operation approaches, the number of messages transmitted increases. An enemy then knows that 
something will occur soon, and their forces are alerted. Strict radio silence is the main defense against 
radio intelligence. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of radio traffic is not the only indicator used by an enemy. Statistical studies of message 
headings, receipts, acknowledgments, relays, routing instructions, and services are also used by an enemy. 
Communications experts can often learn much about an opponent from these studies. Direction finders 
are another aid the enemy can use to determine where messages originate. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Radiotelephone Security 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Radiotelephone networks are operated so frequently that many operators tend to be careless. There 
are too many instances of interception of vhf and uhf transmissions at distances of many thousands of 
miles. You may have occasion to work on or around this type of equipment. If you are ever required to 
bring any transmitter on the air for any purpose, you must be familiar with and use all the correct 
procedures.

</p><h3 class="subsection">SHIPBOARD COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS QUALITY MONITORING (QMCS) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In recent years the volume of shipboard communications has increased greatly. This expansion has 
led to the shipboard installation of sophisticated equipment. Factors such as frequency accuracy and dc 
signal distortion are critical to the operation of communications systems. These systems demand precise 
initial lineup and monitoring to ensure satisfactory operations are maintained. System degradation is often 
caused by many small contributing factors. When these factors are added together, the system becomes 
unusable. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Scheduled Maintenance 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When you perform scheduled, logical checks that ensure continuous, optimum performance of 
shipboard communications systems, you are doing SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE. In many cases this 
maintenance prevents outages before they occur. Some of the scheduled checks will include the 
following:

</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Primary power (voltage, current, cycles) 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">Electromagnetic Interference (emi) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Many complex electronic systems are installed aboard Navy ships. In modern ships, complex 
systems with higher power and greater sensitivity are being crowded into a restricted and corrosive area. 
Figure 3-34 is a Spruance class destroyer with its crowded (compact) communications environment. The 
ability of these systems to perform their individual functions without interference is known as 
ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY (emc). Emc is concerned with the structure of the ship and 
its electrical and electronic system. Compact environment is a major limitation to the effectiveness of a 
total ship system concept.

</p><p class="paragraph">Operation of a total ship system in this unique shipboard environment presents a challenge to all 
concerned. You must always consider the effects that motion, temperature variations, and exposure to 
adverse elements will have on the performance of the total ship system. This is particularly true on those 
system components that are mounted topside. 
</p><p class="paragraph">On board ship, you will find much attention is given to keeping the topside cosmetically and 
mechanically shipshape. It is equally important to keep it electronically shipshape. Minor mechanical 
problems, such as loose connections, broken bond straps, or rusty junctions can cause serious 
communications problems. These sources of electromagnetic radiations reduce receiver performance and 
are known as ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE (emi). Sources of emi can be divided into the 
following broad categories: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Functional. Emi can originate from any source designed to generate electromagnetic energy and 
which may create interference as a normal part of its operation. The interference may be 
unintentional or caused by other on board or adjacent platform systems. This interference also 
may be intentional or caused by electronic countermeasures (ECM). 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Incidental. Emi can originate from man-made sources. These are sources not designed 
specifically to generate electromagnetic energy but which do in fact cause interference. Examples 
of incidental emi sources include power lines, motors, and switches. 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Natural. Emi can be caused by natural phenomena, such as electrical storms, rain particles, and 
solar and interstellar radiation. It is recognized by the following audible noises: 
</p><h3 class="subsection">–  Intermittent impulses of high intensity that are caused by nearby electrical storms 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">–  Steady rattling or cracking caused by distant electrical storms 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">–  Continuous noise of precipitation static caused by electrically charged rain drops 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">–  A steady hiss at high frequencies caused by interstellar noise 
</h3><p class="paragraph">• Hull-generated. Emi can be caused by the interaction of radiated signals with elements of the hull 
and rigging of a ship. (The functional signals themselves do not cause interference.) 
</p><p class="paragraph">The following are two general methods by which emi is transmitted: 
</p><p class="paragraph">Conduction. Undesired energy from one equipment is coupled to interconnecting cables or 
components of another equipment. This energy is conducted via the wiring in the shielded enclosure 
that protects sensitive circuits. You will find proper design, adequate isolation, and shielding of 
cables and equipment can control this problem. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Radiation. Energy is beamed directly from the transmitting antenna, or source, to the victim 
receiving antenna. When this interference is picked up by a receiver, you have two solutions. 
Interfering energy can be eliminated at the source or you can filter, or blank it out at the victim 
equipment. Filtering is far less desirable. Interference may be on the same frequency as the desired 
signal and will not be eliminated without affecting the reception of all desired signals. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most unprotected shipboard receivers are susceptible to emi over a frequency range much wider than 
their normal bandpass. Off-frequency rejection rarely excludes strong, adjacent-channel signals. These 
signals enter the receiver and degrade receiver performance by being processed along with the desired, 
tuned signal. Usually, the presence of emi will be apparent to you. It has a bad effect. Upon the desired 
signal quality, such as that in CROSS-MODULATION where a spurious response occurs when the carrier </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">of a desired signal intermodulates with the carrier of an undesired signal. Extremely strong, off-frequency 
signals may even burn out the sensitive front-end stages of a receiver. Emi also can degrade overall 
receiver performance in a less noticeable way. It does this by desensitizing the receiver front end. The 
noise level is raised and effectively lowers the signal to noise ratio and thus the sensitivity. This causes a 
decrease in desired signal amplification. For these reasons, shipboard receive systems are designed to 
include protective circuitry between the antenna and receiver to filter out off-frequency signals. This 
prevents or limits interference, desensitization, or burnout. Depending upon the system, these protective 
devices may include filters, multicouplers, preselectors, and so forth. These devices can minimize 
interference caused by inadequate frequency separation or poor physical isolation between transmit and 
receive antennas.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Radio-frequency (rf) transmitting systems with high-power transmitting tubes and high-gain 
antennas have increased the possibility of injury to personnel working in the vicinity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An electromagnetic radiation hazard exists when electronic equipment generates a strong enough 
electromagnetic field to fall in a category listed below: 
</p><h3 class="subsection">• Causes harmful or injurious effects to humans and wildlife 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Induces or otherwise couples currents and/or voltages of magnitudes large enough to initiate 
electroexplosive devices or other sensitive explosive components of weapons systems, ordnance, 
or other explosive devices 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Creates sparks large enough to ignite flammable mixtures or materials that must be handled in the 
affected areas 
</h3><p class="paragraph">These hazardous situations can be caused by a transmitter or antenna installation. These generate 
electromagnetic radiation in the vicinity of personnel, ordnance, or fueling operations in excess of 
established safe levels. Sometimes the existing electromagnetic radiation levels increase to a hazardous 
level. When personnel, ordnance, or fueling evolutions are located in an area that can be illuminated by 
electromagnetic radiation, hazardous situations may occur. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Electromagnetic radiation is hazardous to personnel in two ways. It can cause rf burns; and it can 
cause biological, thermal, and neurological effects to personnel (RADHAZ). Because of the differences in 
characteristics and safety precautions required for each of the two types, they will be discussed separately. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An rf burn hazard is a hazardous condition caused by the existence of radio frequency (rf) voltages in 
places where they are not intended to be. Any ship with high-power hf transmitters is susceptible. 
Potentially hazardous voltages have been found in many areas. Some of these areas are lifelines, vertical 
ladders, ASROC launchers, gun mounts, rigging for underway replenishment, and boat davits. Another of 
these areas is on aircraft tied down on carrier and helicopter flight decks. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Whether or not an induced voltage creates an rf burn hazard depends on whether personnel will 
come into contact with the object being energized. Generally, only the voltage between an object and the 
deck is important. The rf burn occurs when a person comes into contact with a source of rf voltage in a </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

flow at the areas of contact causes heat. The effect of the heat on a person at the point of contact ranges 
from noticeable warmth to a painful burn. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The most useful and widespread technique in the reduction of rf burn hazards is the proper bonding 
and grounding of all metallic objects in the rf radiation field. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In some cases, the rf burn hazard can be eliminated only through the use of restrictive operating 
procedures. These procedures govern the simultaneous use of transmitting and cargo equipment. 
Techniques such as operation of transmitters at reduced power and the prohibition of simultaneous use of

</p><p class="paragraph">Most studies on the subject of radiation hazards (RADHAZ) have emphasized the impact of 
electromagnetic radiation on man. Man is singled out because of the biological, thermal, and neurological 
effects that occur in human organs and other biological tissues. Certain organs of the body are considered 
to be more susceptible than others to the effects of electromagnetic radiation. Presently available 
information and experience indicate that the eyes and testes are the most vulnerable body organs. The 
overwhelming danger to date appears to be the hazard from thermal effects, which are a function of 
intensity of radiation and frequency. This is particularly true in the range of 1 to 3 gigahertz. Thermal 
effects appear to taper off in severity outside this range. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the body is irradiated by energy from a point source, the total body surface is usually not 
exposed. The larger the area exposed and the larger the radiation power density, the higher the body 
temperature rise and the greater the hazard. Microwave radiation from a radar source will "cook" you 
internally, just as a microwave oven cooks a chicken. 
</p><p class="paragraph">An injury of great concern is that to the lens of the eye. Exposure of the lens to high-intensity 
microwaves may cause cataracts. Current medical evidence indicates that a significant temperature 
elevation of the lens is required for cataract formation. If exposure is limited to 10 milliwatts per 
centimeter squared, the lens temperature is not elevated to levels at which cataracts occur. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to thermal effects, nonionizing radiation is known to produce nonthermal effects. An 
association of a biological hazard with the nonthermal effects has not been demonstrated. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A peculiar effect experienced by some personnel is the sensation of sound when they are exposed to 
pulsed microwave fields. This occurs at levels below stated hazard limits and is not, by itself, considered 
dangerous.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HISTORY-OF-SATELLITE-COMMUNICATIONS-4-1-">HISTORY OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The first artificial satellite was placed in orbit by the Russians in 1957. That satellite, called Sputnik, 
signaled the beginning of an era. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The United States, who was behind the Russians, made an all-out effort to catch up, and launched 
Score in 1958. That was the first satellite with the primary purpose of communications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The first regular satellite communications service was used by the Navy in 1960. The moon was used 
to bounce teletypewriter signals between Hawaii and Washington, D.C. During the early 1960s, the Navy 
used the moon as a medium for passing messages between ships at sea and shore stations. This method of 
communications proved reliable when other methods failed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Military satellite communications technology was at a low level until 1965. At that time high quality 
voice transmissions were conducted between a satellite and two earth stations. That was the stepping 
stone to the Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program (IDCSP), which will be covered later in 
this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Experience with satellite communications has demonstrated that satellite systems can satisfy many 
military requirements. They are reliable, survivable, secure, and a cost effective method of 
telecommunications. You can easily see that satellites are the ideal, if not often the only, solution to 
problems of communicating with highly mobile forces. Satellites, if properly used, provide much needed 
options to large, fixed-ground installations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">For the past fifty years, the Navy has used high-frequency (hf) transmissions as the principal method 
of sending messages. In the 1970s, the hf spectrum was overcrowded and "free" frequencies were at a </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">premium. Hf jamming and electronic countermeasures (ECM) techniques became highly sophisticated 
during that period. As a result the need for new and advanced long-range transmission methods became 
apparent. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Communications via satellite is a natural outgrowth of modern technology and of the continuing 
demand for greater capacity and higher quality in communications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the past, the various military branches have had the resources to support their communications 
needs. Predicted usage indicates that large-scale improvements will have to be made to satisfy future 
needs of the Department of Defense. These needs will require greater capacity for long-haul 
communications to previously inaccessible areas. Satellite communications has the most promise for 
satisfying these future requirements. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">DEFENSE COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE PROGRAM (DCSP) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The Defense Communications Satellite Program (DCSP) was initiated by the Secretary of Defense in 
1962. Phase I of the program was given the title Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program 
(IDCSP). The first satellite launch occurred in June 1966 when seven experimental satellites were placed 
into orbit. The final launch of this program consisted of eight satellites and occurred in June 1968. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">DEFENSE SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM (DSCS) PHASE II 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The Phase II Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCP Phase II) has changed from an all-
analog communications system to an all-digital communications system. The performance capability 
provided by the Phase II DSCS is limited by equipment availability. Extensive digital traffic capability 
has become common. You can credit this to the availability of digital modems (modulator/demodulator) 
and broadband equipment. Overall performance of the Phase II DSCS is a great improvement over the 
capabilities provided by Phase I DSCS. The Phase II satellites provide a great increase in effective 
radiated power and rf bandwidths. You will find these satellite configurations use wide coverage and 
narrow beam antennas. They provide an extensive range of communications services and capabilities. 
(This will be further discussed later, in this chapter.) 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FUNDAMENTAL-SATELLITE-COMMUNICATIONS-SYSTEM-4-2-">FUNDAMENTAL SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A satellite communications system uses satellites to relay radio transmissions between earth 
terminals. The two types of communications satellites you will study are ACTIVE and PASSIVE. A 
passive satellite only reflects received radio signals back to earth. An active satellite acts as a 
REPEATER; it amplifies signals received and then retransmits them back to earth. This increases signal 
strength at the receiving terminal to a higher level than would be available from a passive satellite. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A typical operational link involves an active satellite and two or more earth terminals. One station 
transmits to the satellite on a frequency called the UP-LINK frequency. The satellite then amplifies the 
signal, converts it to the DOWN-LINK frequency, and transmits it back to earth. The signal is next picked 
up by the receiving terminal. Figure 4-1 shows a satellite handling several combinations of links 
simultaneously. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The basic design of a satellite communications system depends to a great degree upon the 
characteristics of the orbit of the satellite. In general terms, an orbit is either elliptical or circular in shape. 
A special type of orbit is a SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT. In this type you will find the period (time required 
for one revolution) of the orbit the same as that of the earth. An orbit that is not synchronous is called 
ASYNCHRONOUS. A period of orbit that approaches that of the earth is called NEAR 
SYNCHRONOUS (subsynchronous). Orbits are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to the fundamental components shown in figure 4-1, the design of the overall system 
determines the complexity of the various components and the manner in which the system operates. 
Current satellites are capable of handling many teletypewriter (tty) and voice circuits at the same time. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Orbit Descriptions 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Orbits generally are described according to the physical shape of the orbit and the angle of 
inclination of the plane of the orbit. These terms aye discussed in the following paragraphs: 
</p><p class="paragraph">PHYSICAL SHAPE.—All satellites orbit the earth in elliptical orbits. (A circle is a special case of 
an ellipse.) The shape of the orbit is determined by the initial launch parameters and the later deployment 
techniques used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">PERIGEE and APOGEE are two, of the three parameters used to describe orbital data of a satellite. 
These are shown on figure 4-2. Perigee is the point in the orbit nearest to the center of the earth. Apogee 
is the point in the orbit the greatest distance from the center of the earth. Both distances are expressed in 
nautical miles. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the equatorial plane of the earth is in an EQUATORIAL ORBIT. A satellite orbiting in an inclined orbit 
with an angle of inclination of 90 degrees or near 90 degrees is in a POLAR ORBIT. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SPECIAL TYPES OF CIRCULAR ORBITS.—We stated previously that a circular orbit is a 
special type of elliptical orbit. You should realize a circular orbit is one in which the major and minor axis 
distances are equal or approximately equal. Mean height above earth, instead of perigee and apogee, is 
used in describing a circular orbit. While we are discussing circular orbits, you should look at some of the 
terms mentioned earlier in this chapter. A satellite in a circular orbit at a height of approximately 19,300 
nautical miles above the earth is in a synchronous orbit. At this altitude the period of rotation of the 
satellite is 24 hours, the same as the rotation period of the earth. In other words, the orbit of the satellite is 
in sync with the rotational motion of the earth. Although inclined and polar synchronous orbits are 
possible, the term synchronous usually refers to a synchronous equatorial orbit. In this type of orbit, 
satellites appear to hover motionlessly in the sky. Figure 4-5 shows how one of these satellites can 
provide coverage to almost half the surface of the earth.

less than the period of orbit of the earth. The satellite then appears to be moving slowly around the earth 
from west to east. (This type of orbit is also called subsynchronous.) If the orbit is higher than 19,300 
nautical miles, the period of orbit of the satellite is greater than the period of orbit of the earth. The 
satellite then appears to be moving slowly around the earth from east to west. Although inclined and polar 
near-synchronous orbits are possible, near synchronous implies an equatorial orbit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A satellite in a circular orbit from approximately 2,000 miles to 12,000 miles above the earth is 
considered to be in a MEDIUM ALTITUDE ORBIT. The period of a medium altitude satellite is

</p><p class="paragraph">As early as June 1960, two satellites were successfully placed in orbit by the same launch vehicle. 
With the development of multilaunch capability, added flexibility became available. We then had choices 
as to the size, weight, and number of satellites to be included in each launch. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Using our multilaunch capabilities, the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) has 
placed larger and heavier satellites in synchronous equatorial orbits. Figure 4-7 is a drawing of a DSCS 
satellite. It shows each pair of transmit and receive dish antennas. As you can see, a large area of the earth 
can be covered using only one satellite. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Satellite Power Sources 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Early communications satellites were severely limited by the lack of suitable power sources. This 
severely limited the output power of the satellite transmitter. The only source of power available within 
early weight restrictions was a very inefficient panel of solar cells without battery backup. A major 
disadvantage of this type of power source is that the satellite has no power when it is in ECLIPSE (not in 
view of the sun). For continuous communications, this outage is unacceptable. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A combination of solar cells and storage batteries is a better prime power source. This is a practical 
choice, even though the result is far from an ideal power source. About ten percent of the energy of the 
sunlight that strikes the solar cells is converted to electrical power. This low rate is sometimes decreased 
even further. You find this when the solar cells are bombarded by high-energy particles that are 
sometimes found in space. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Early satellites had over 8,500 solar cells mounted on the surface of the satellite, which supplied 
about 42 watts of power. No battery backup was provided in these satellites. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Newer communications satellites have about 32,000 solar cells mounted on the surface of the 
satellite, and they supply about 520 watts. A nickel cadmium battery is used for backup power during 
eclipses. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Nuclear power sources have been used in space for special purposes, but their use stops there. 
Technology has not progressed sufficiently for nuclear power sources to be used as a power source. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Satellite Orientation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Satellite orientation in space is important for continuous solar cell and antenna orientation. Since the 
primary source of power in most satellites is from solar cells, a maximum number of the solar cells must 
be exposed to the sun at all times. The satellite antenna must also be pointed at the appropriate earth 
terminals. Our communications satellites use what is termed spin stabilization to meet these important 
requirements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Spin stabilization operates on the principle that direction of the spin axis of a rotating body tends to 
remain fixed in space. An example of spin stabilization is the effect of the rotation of the earth in keeping 
its axis fixed in space. A satellite that has a spin axis parallel to the axis of the earth will maintain this 
position since both axes are fixed in space. Figure 4-8 illustrates the use of this principle. It depicts an 
equatorial orbit satellite used to keep a doughnut-shaped antenna pattern pointing toward the earth. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Once the system is in motion, spin stabilization requires virtually no additional energy. A spin-
stabilized satellite is usually constructed like a flywheel. Its heavier equipment is mounted in the same 
plane and as close to the outside surface as possible. 
</p><p class="paragraph">After reaching its orbit, the radial jets are pulsed to start the satellite spinning. The satellite spin axis 
is orientated to the axis of the earth by means of small axial jets. Velocity jets are used to place the 
satellite in orbit position and provide velocity correction. Figure 4-9 is an example of spin stabilization.

</p><p class="paragraph">Solar cells are installed around the outside surface of a spin-stabilized satellite. This gives you a 
large number of solar cells exposed to the sun at all times (except when the satellite is in eclipse). The use 
of omnidirectional antennas causes a small part of the total radiated energy to be directed toward the earth 
at all times. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Ominidirectional antennas radiate only a small amount of energy toward the earth. Many techniques 
have been tried to achieve an earth-oriented antenna system. One system developed uses spin stabilization 
for orientation of the satellite. It uses a stationary inner platform for mounting remote controlled antennas. 
The satellite is constructed in two parts with both parts having radial jets. The inner platform contains the 
communications antennas and the communications package. After the satellite is stabilized in space, inner 
radial jets spin the inner platform. The inner platform is stationary with respect to earth and is oriented to 
such a position that the communications antennas point continuously toward the earth. This arrangement 
allows the use of high-gain directional antennas that concentrate the majority of the radiated energy in the 
direction of the earth. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The latest versions of communications satellites use a stationary platform with four high-gain 
antennas. Two steerable narrow beam antennas are used for communications between and within regions 
of high traffic density. Two horn antennas provide for earth communications between facilities outside 
the narrow beam coverage. The antenna arrangement for these types of communications satellites is 
shown in figure 4-7.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Communications satellite earth terminals are usually located in areas remote from the actual users of 
these communications. This is necessary to minimize rf interference to the satellite. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Locating the terminals in these remote locations requires interconnecting communications links. 
Links permit communications flow to and from the users of the satellite systems. Interconnect links are 
usually connected via telephone cables or microwave radio links with normal terminal equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Earth satellite communications terminals generally have a single, large antenna; a highly sensitive 
receiver; a powerful transmitter; multiplex equipment; modulating-demodulating equipment; and 
telemetry equipment. Each of these elements will be discussed later in this chapter. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Antennas 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Earth terminal antennas are highly directional, high-gain antennas capable of transmitting and 
receiving signals simultaneously. Generally, large, high-gain, parabolic antennas are used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Generally speaking, three sizes of parabolic-type antennas are currently in use at earth terminal sites. 
These are a parabolic antenna sixty feet in diameter, a parabolic antenna forty feet in diameter, and a 
cluster of four parabolic antennas, each ten feet in diameter. These four in combination are equal to a 
parabolic antenna eighteen feet in diameter. They are shown in figures 4-10, 4-11, and 4-12, respectively. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">All satellite communications earth terminals are equipped with specially designed, highly sensitive 
receivers. These receivers are designed to overcome down-link power losses and to permit extraction of 
the desired communications information from the weak received signal. The terminals currently in use 
have specially designed preamplifiers mounted directly behind the antennas. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Transmitters 
</h3><p class="paragraph">All earth terminal transmitters generate high-power signals for transmission to the communications 
satellites. High-powered transmitters and highly directional, high-gain antennas are combined in this 
configuration. This is necessary to overcome up-link limitations and to ensure that the signals received by 
the satellite are strong enough to be detected by the satellite. Each transmitter has an exciter/modulator 
and a power amplifier. The modulator accepts the input signal from the terminal equipment and 
modulates an IF carrier. The exciter translates the IF signal to the up-link frequency and amplifies it to the 
level required by the power amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Transmitters used in earth terminals have output power capabilities that vary from 10 watts to 20 
kilowatts, depending on the type used and the operational requirements.

broadcasts, which, as you recall from chapter 1, require no receipt. These are transmitted from a ground 
station and relayed to naval vessels by satellite. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-13 is a typical shipboard receive-only system. In this system the transmitted carrier may be 
frequency modulated (fm) or phase-shift-key (psk) modulated for tty operation. The receiving antennas 
for this system are positioned about the ship. They are arranged in a manner (normally one in each 
quadrant of the ship) that at no time allows the line-of-sight to be blocked between the relay satellite and 
one or more of the antennas. Incoming signals pass from the antennas to an amplifier-converter. Each 
amplifier-converter routes an IF signal on one line of a twin axial cable that connects it to the combiner-
demodulator. An operating power and local-oscillator signal are coupled from the combiner-demodulator 
to each amplifier-converter on the other line of the cable used for the IF signal. Because of signal path 
variations, shading, and reflections, the incoming signals are subject to random phase and amplitude 
variations. The combiner operation performed within the combiner-demodulator removes the phase 
variations from each input signal. It then measures the amplitudes of the signals for optimum combining 
and sums the signals. After being combined, the signal is demodulated and coupled from a receiver 
transfer switchboard to a telegraph demultiplex terminal.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SATELLITE-ACQUISITION-AND-TRACKING-4-13-">SATELLITE ACQUISITION AND TRACKING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">An essential operation in communicating by satellite is the acquisition (locating) of the satellite by 
the earth terminal antenna and the subsequent tracking of the satellite. Initial acquisition depends upon an 
exact knowledge of the position of the satellite. In combination with the geographic location of the earth 
terminal, knowing the position of the satellite enables you to compute accurate antenna pointing 
information. The degree of difficulty in locating and tracking a satellite is determined largely by what 
type orbit the satellite is in. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The locating and tracking of a synchronous satellite is relatively simple. This is because the satellite 
appears to be stationary. Locating a near-synchronous satellite is also relatively simple because of the 
slow relative motion of the satellite However, the movement of a near-synchronous satellite is enough 
that accurate tracking is required to keep the narrow beam antenna pointed toward the satellite. Satellites 
in medium altitude circular orbits or in elliptical orbits are more difficult to acquire and to track because 
of the rapid changes in position. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Orbital Prediction 
</h3><p class="paragraph">To acquire and track a satellite in space, the earth terminal antennas must be provided with very 
accurate pointing information. Antenna pointing information is based upon the orbital prediction of the 
satellite. This information is derived from an EPHEMERIS table. This table provides the coordinates of a 
satellite or a celestial body at specific times during a given period. After you know the ephemeris data of 
a satellite, you can predict for any given location the apparent track of the satellite as viewed from that 
location. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The constants defining an orbit are initially obtained by the process of tracking. At the time of 
launch, the rocket is tracked by radar from lift-off to orbit and then until it passes out of sight. Tracking 
data obtained in this way is sufficient for making rough predictions of the orbit. These predictions are 
made rapidly with a computer and sent to tracking stations all over the world. These other tracking 
stations watch for the satellite during its first trip and record additional data. During the first week of 
orbiting, tracking stations all around the world are obtaining progressively more accurate data concerning 
the Satellite. This data is put into a computer where corrections of earlier estimates of the orbit are made. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Once the initial predictions are complete and the satellite link becomes operational, very little change 
in these calculations is made. The orbits of a satellite will change slightly over a period of time; however, 
these changes are so gradual that predictions will be accurate enough to be used for weeks or even months 
without further corrections. When the orbits are known precisely, an ephemeris can be calculated for each 
satellite of the system. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Antenna Pointing 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Antenna pointing instructions for each satellite must be computed separately for each ground station 
location. A satellite that bears due south of station A at an elevation of 25 degrees may simultaneously 
bear due southeast of station B at an elevation of 30 degrees. Antenna pointing instructions are 
determined by taking into consideration the orbital prediction and the latitude and longitude of each 
ground station. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To establish radio contact with a satellite, the ground station needs to know the bearing and elevation 
of a satellite. This allows the antenna to be properly pointed. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Acquisition 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The acquisition of satellite signals by a ground station equipped with large antennas and operated at 
microwave frequencies places severe requirements on the system. Several factors must be considered. 
These factors are discussed below: 
</p><p class="paragraph">SPATIAL-TIME FACTOR.—Very accurate antenna pointing information is available to earth 
terminals from the satellite control facility located in Sunnyvale, California. Because of equipment 
limitations, a small search about the predicted location of the satellite must often be conducted to make 
initial contact. Either a manual or automatic scan is made around a small area close to the point where the 
satellite appearance is predicted. 
</p><p class="paragraph">FREQUENCY CONTROL.—The frequency of a radio signal received from a satellite is not 
generally the exact assigned down-link frequency. This variation depends upon the type of orbit of the 
satellite. The greatest frequency variations in signals from satellites occur in medium altitude circular or 
elliptical orbits. The smallest frequency variations occur in signals from satellites in near-synchronous or 
synchronous orbits. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tracking 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When a particular satellite has been acquired, the earth terminal antenna will track that satellite for as 
long as it is used as a communications relay. Several methods of tracking are in actual use; however, we 
will explain PROGRAMMED TRACKING and AUTOMATIC TRACKING. 
</p><p class="paragraph">PROGRAMMED TRACKING.—In programmed tracking the known orbital parameters of the 
satellite are fed into computation equipment to generate antenna pointing angles. The antenna pointing 
angles are fed as commands to the antenna positioning servomechanisms. (You may want to review 
servos in NEETS, Module 15, Principles of Synchros, Servos, and Gyros.) These point the antenna in the 
required direction. The amount of data and computations involved in using programmed tracking is 
extensive. These are a result of the antenna mount flexing and atmospheric and ionospheric bending of 
radio waves. Because of these uncertainties, programmed tracking is not used extensively. 
</p><p class="paragraph">AUTOMATIC TRACKING.—In automatic tracking, the equipment generates antenna pointing 
information by comparing the direction of the antenna axis with the direction from which an actual 
satellite signal is received. Automatic tracking systems track the apparent position of a satellite. The 
direction of arrival of the radio signal and the real position of the satellite is not required. The automatic 
tracking system uses a servomechanism to move the antenna. Once the satellite has been located, the 
servomechanism generates its own pointing data. This eliminates the requirement for continuous data 
input and computation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SATELLITE OUTAGE TIME.—The satellite outage time specifications allow for stewing 
(moving) the earth terminal antennas, acquiring the satellite signal, and checking for circuit continuity at 
HAND OVER. (Hand over is the period of time for one earth terminal to yield control to another as a 
satellite moves out of its area of coverage.) This hand over period represents an outage time. If the control 
terminal is unable to hand over to another terminal within a specified time, other arrangements are made. 
For example, control may be retained or transferred to another terminal within the coverage area. There 
are several reasons why a terminal may be unable to assume control on time; these reasons may combine 
to increase the outage time. The difference of drift velocities of the satellites leads to bunching within a 
coverage area. This causes gaps in coverage and increases outage times. When two or more satellites 
simultaneously occupy the same space of the terminal antennas, they will interfere with each other. This 
prevents reliable communications. Other factors leading to increased outage times are SATELLITE-SUN 
CONJUNCTION (increased noise while the satellite passes near the sun), SATELLITE ECLIPSE </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="question">Q12. Why is satellite acquisition and tracking important? 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ROLE-OF-SATELLITE-COMMUNICATIONS-4-15-">ROLE OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In the context of a worldwide military communications network, satellite communications systems 
are very important. Satellite communications links add capacity to existing communications capabilities 
and provide additional alternate routings for communications traffic. Satellite links, as one of several 
kinds of long-distance links, interconnect switching centers located strategically around the world. They 
are part of the defense communication systems (DCS) network. One important aspect of the satellite 
communications network is that it continues in operation under conditions that sometimes render other 
methods of communications inoperable. Because of this, satellites make a significant contribution to 
improved reliability of Navy communications. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ADVANTAGES-OF-SATELLITE-COMMUNICATIONS-4-15-">ADVANTAGES OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Satellite communications have unique advantages over conventional long distance transmissions. 
Satellite links are unaffected by the propagation variations that interfere with hf radio. They are also free 
from the high attenuation of wire or cable facilities and are capable of spanning long distances. The 
numerous repeater stations required for line-of-sight or troposcatter links are no longer needed. They 
furnish the reliability and flexibility of service that is needed to support a military operation. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Capacity 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The present military communications satellite system is capable of communications between 
backpack, airborne, and shipboard terminals. The system is capable of handling thousands of 
communications channels. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Reliability 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Communications satellite frequencies are not dependent upon reflection or refraction and are 
affected only slightly by atmospheric phenomena. The reliability of satellite communications systems is 
limited only by the equipment reliability and the skill of operating and maintenance personnel. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Vulnerability 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Destruction of an orbiting vehicle by an enemy is possible. However, destruction of a single 
communications satellite would be quite difficult and expensive. The cost would be excessive compared 
to the tactical advantage gained. It would be particularly difficult to destroy an entire multiple-satellite 
system such as the twenty-six random-orbit satellite system currently in use. The earth terminals offer a 
more attractive target for physical destruction. These can be protected by the same measures that are 
taken to protect other vital installations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A high degree of freedom from jamming damage is provided by the highly directional antennas at 
the earth terminals. The wide bandwidth system that can accommodate sophisticated anti-jam modulation 
techniques also lessens vulnerability. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">Most operational military satellite earth terminals are housed in transportable vans. These can be 
loaded into cargo planes and flown to remote areas. With trained crews these terminals can be put into 
operation in a matter of hours. Worldwide communications can be established quickly to remote areas 
nearly anywhere in the free world. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SATELLITE-LIMITATIONS-4-16-">SATELLITE LIMITATIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Limitations of a satellite communications system are determined by the technical characteristics of 
the satellite and its orbital parameters. Active communications satellite systems are limited by two things. 
Satellite transmitter power on the down links and receiver sensitivity on the up links. Some early 
communications satellites have been limited by low-gain antennas. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Power 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The amount of power available in an active satellite is limited by the weight restrictions imposed on 
the satellite. Early communications satellites were limited to a few hundred pounds because of launch-
vehicle payload restraints. The only feasible power source is the inefficient solar cell. (Total power 
generation in the earlier satellites was less than 50 watts.) As you can see, the rf power output is severely 
limited; therefore, a relatively weak signal is transmitted by the satellite on the down link. The weak 
transmitted signal is often reduced by propagation losses. This results in a very weak signal being 
available at the earth terminals. The level of signals received from a satellite is comparable to the 
combination of external atmospheric noise and internal noise of standard receivers. Special techniques 
must be used to extract the desired information from the received signal. Large, high-gain antennas and 
special types of preamplifiers solve this problem but add complexity and size to the earth terminal. (The 
smallest terminal in the defense communication systems network has effectively an 18-foot antenna and 
weighs 19,500 pounds.) Development of more efficient power sources and relaxation of weight 
restrictions have permitted improved satellite performance and increased capacity. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Receiver Sensitivity 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Powerful transmitters with highly directional antennas are used at earth stations. Even with these 
large transmitters, a lot of signal loss occurs at the satellite. The satellite antenna receives only a small 
amount of the transmitted signal power. A relatively weak signal is received at the satellite receiver. This 
presents little problem as the strength of the signal received on the up link is not as critical as that 
received on the down link. The down-link signal is critical because the signal transmitted from the 
satellite is very low in power. Development of high-gain antennas and highly sensitive receivers have 
helped to solve the down-link problem. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Availability 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The availability of a satellite to act as a relay station between two earth terminals depends on the 
locations of the earth terminals and the orbit of the satellite. All satellites, except those in a synchronous 
orbit, will be in view of any given pair of earth stations only part of the time. The length of time that a 
nonsynchronous satellite in a circular orbit will be in the ZONE OF MUTUAL VISIBILITY (the satellite 
can be seen from both terminals) depends upon the height at which the satellite is circling. Elliptical orbits 
cause the satellite zone of mutual visibility between any two earth terminals to vary from orbit to orbit. 
These times of mutual visibility are predictable. Figure 4-14 illustrates the zone of mutual visibility. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Department of the Navy established the Naval Space Command, which assumed operational 
responsibility for Navy space systems plus coordination responsibility with other operational activities. 
Most ships have satellite communications capability. New systems have been installed on ships and are 
fully compatible with other electronic systems and equipment. Communications via satellite has increased 
existing Navy communications capabilities for the command and control of naval forces. Satellite 
communications has not replaced all existing means of radio communications. However, it is a major step 
in modernizing Navy communications. It has relieved the Navy of its total dependence on hf radio 
transmission and reduced the need for many hf ground stations overseas. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A recent step in the advancement of satellite communications was the start of the DSCS Phase III. 
The first Phase III satellite was launched into orbit by the space shuttle in the summer of 1984. Seven 
satellites will be placed in space during this phase. Figure 4-15 shows a Phase III satellite being tested in a 
simulated space environment, Figure 4-16 shows the Phase III satellite as it appears in space. Phase III 
will develop the use of 40-watt, solid-state amplifiers to replace the currently used traveling-wave tube

</h2><p class="paragraph">Most of the receivers and transmitters that you will see used in the mf portions of the rf spectrum and 
below are very similar in design. In chapter 1 we discussed the operational uses of the equipment; now 
let's look at the equipment itself. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Equipment items covered in this and other chapters are meant to be merely representative of 
equipment that may be encountered in naval communications. No attempt will be made to include all of 
the possible equipment or equipment configurations. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Transmit Equipment 
</h3><p class="paragraph">You should realize the transmitters used in bands of medium frequency and below are similar to 
those you studied in chapter 2. In other words, a transmitter used in one frequency range is basically the 
same as one used in another range. However, there are some differences. Two of the differences are 
component size and the use of a technique called DOUBLING UP. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The components used in bands of medium frequency and below are much larger physically than the 
ones previously discussed. This is because of the higher operating voltage and current levels required to 
produce the very high-powered rf outputs needed for the uses covered in chapter 1. A given resistor used 
in an hf application may be rated at 1/2 watt, whereas the same resistor used in a lower frequency 
application would probably be rated in tens or even hundreds of watts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A block diagram of a doubled-up transmitter is shown in figure 5-1. Remember, bands of medium 
frequencies and below are used almost exclusively for broadcast and are on the air continuously. 
Doubling up increases reliability. As you can see, two transmitters are located in the same equipment 
cabinet. This allows you to quickly transfer circuits if one should fail. This dual installation also allows 
both amplifiers to be used together to double the output power. When you use this application, you 
sacrifice the doubling-up capability of only the power amplifier. All the other components are still 
available as backups. Let's go through figure 5-1 and describe the block functions.

</p><p class="paragraph">The frequency generator part of the frequency generator and fsk block is an oscillator. It provides the 
carrier frequencies for the cw mode. The fsk part is a FREQUENCY SYNTHESIZER (a frequency source 
of high accuracy). It makes both the mark and space frequencies from a very stable clock oscillator. The 
keying pulses determine which fsk frequency the keyer chooses to transmit. This signal is then sent to the 
transmitter control console where it is distributed to the first rf amplifier. This amplifier is referred to as 
the preliminary intermediate-power amplifier (pre-ipa). The pre-ipa uses linear, untuned, push-pull, rf 
amplifiers to provide amplified rf to drive other rf amplifiers. The pre-ipa output goes to the intermediate 
power amplifier (ipa). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ipa receives the pre-ipa output, amplifies the signal, and drives other selected power amplifiers. 
The ipa is a single-stage, untuned, linear, push-pull, rf circuit that uses water and forced-air cooled tubes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Signals are then sent through the amplifier control, where they are used for signal monitoring 
purposes before being applied to the final rf amplifier (pa). The pa amplifies the signal to the final desired 
power level. The pa also contains variometers (variable inductors) for coupling. This coupled output is 
fed to the rf tuning unit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The rf tuning unit consists of variable oil-filled capacitors and a fixed inductor for frequency tuning. 
The signal is then sent to a knife switch. This switch simply routes the signal to the DUMMY LOAD or 
the antenna by way of the HELIX HOUSE. (A dummy load is a nonradiating device the absorbs the rf </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">and has the impedance characteristics of the antenna.) The dummy load is impedance matched to the pa. 
It allows testing of the pa without putting a signal on the air. When the equipment is in an operating 
mode, the dummy load is not used. The helix house is a small building physically separated from the 
transmitter location. It contains antenna loading, coupling, and tuning circuits. The main components 
consist of a HELIX (large coil) and variable inductors. The signal is fed from the helix directly to the 
antenna. Sometimes two antennas are used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Antenna designs vary with the amount and type of land available, desired signal coverage, and 
bandwidth requirements. Figure 5-2 shows a simplified transmit antenna. The Navy uses TOP-HAT (flat-
top) capacitive loading with one or more radiating elements. Typical top hat antennas consist of two or 
more lengths of wire parallel to each other and to the ground, each fed at or near its mid point. The 
lengths of wire are usually supported by vertical towers. These antennas may take many shapes. The 
matching network shown is in the helix house. Figure 5-3 shows the installation at the naval 
communications unit in Cutler, Maine. The Navy has several of these types of installations. They are used 
primarily for fleet broadcasts and have power outputs in the .25- to 2-megahertz range. You should notice 
the transmitter, the location of the helix houses, and the dual antennas. You should also notice the 
transmission line tunnel. It is underground and over a half-mile long. Figure 5-4, view (A) and view (B), 
shows another antenna configuration. This array of monopoles (quarter-wave, vertically polarized stubs) 
is referred to as a TRIATIC antenna. A triatic antenna is a special form of a rhombic-arranged monopole 
array. This type of array is designed to transmit from a particular location. Triatics are all basically the 
same but have some design differences at each site. The physical differences compensate for differences 
in terrain. Now that we have looked at the transmit side, let's look at the receive side.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Receive Equipment 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The receiver you will study here is fundamentally the same as those we covered in chapter 2. A 
receiver used in this frequency range is about the same electrically as one used in any other range. Figure 
5-5 shows the receiver we will discuss. It is a highly sensitive, special purpose receiver because it is 
capable of splitting-out multiplex signals for detection and reproduction. This receiver covers the 
frequency range of 3 kilohertz to 810 kilohertz in five bands. It will receive most types of signals, 
including AM, cw, ssb, fm, and fsk. All operator controls are on the front panel, and a speaker and 
headset jack permit monitoring. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Our receiver has five basic stages excluding the power supply. With the exception of a video 
amplifier in place of an rf amplifier, the circuits perform the functions normally associated with a typical 
receiver. Figure 5-6 is a block diagram showing the signal paths of the receiver. The input stage consists 
of a low-pass filter, an attenuator, a calibration oscillator, and a video amplifier. The low-pass filter passes 
input frequencies below 900 kilohertz. These frequencies are passed to the attenuator, which sets the 
signal to the proper level to drive the mixer. This minimizes noise and distortion. The calibration 
oscillator produces a 250-kilohertz output. It is used to calibrate the receiver level and to check for tuning 
dial accuracy. The input signal is direct-coupled from the attenuator to the video amplifier. This amplifier 
is a broadband, constant-impedance driver for the mixer. The oscillator-mixer stage consists of a mixer, 
phase splitter, local oscillator, and frequency control circuits. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A Hartley configuration is used for the local oscillator. The oscillator output is equal to the tuned 
frequency plus 2.215 megahertz. Two voltage-variable capacitors are used in the local oscillator to 
stabilize small frequency variations. A phase splitter is used to drive the mixer diodes into conduction 
during half of the local oscillator cycle. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The mixer circuit uses the diodes to heterodyne the input signal with the local oscillator signal from 
the phase splitter. The diodes short the signal to ground during half the local oscillator cycle. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The IF amplifier stages consist of the mixer amplifier, four selectable bandwidth filters, three IF 
amplifiers, and an IF buffer amplifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The output of the mixer is directly coupled to the mixer amplifier. The IF signal is then directed 
through one of four bandwidth filters to the first IF amplifier. The signal proceeds to the second and third 
IF amplifiers for amplification before demodulation. An IF buffer amplifier is used to pass the IF to the IF 
OUT jack and to isolate this jack from the rest of the circuitry. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Three demodulators are used in this receiver. They are the AM detector, product detector, and fm 
detector. The AM detector is used to demodulate AM signals. The product detector demodulates ssb, cw, 
and fsk signals, and the fm detector demodulates fm signals only. An output from the fm detector is 
provided to the FM OUT jack. This fm output may be used for recording or detailed analysis. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

simultaneously to the HEADSET jack, AUDIO OUT terminals, and the speaker. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You should note that this receiver, as with most others, requires no other special equipment. It uses a 
standard df loop or a whip antenna. If it is installed in a submarine, a trailed, (towed) long-wire antenna 
may be used. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MICROWAVE-5-8-">MICROWAVE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Communications systems in the 1 gigahertz to 10 gigahertz portion of the radio frequency spectrum 
use line-of-sight propagation. Propagation takes place in the lower atmosphere (troposphere). It is 
affected by factors such as barometric pressure, temperature, water vapor, turbulence, and stratification 
(forming of atmospheric layers). 
</p><p class="paragraph">A typical microwave transmitter includes an exciter group, a modulator group, a power amplifier, 
and power supplies. The transmitter usually has a power output of about 1 watt. When a higher output is 
required (about 5 watts), a traveling-wave tube (twt) is used as the amplifier. (A twt is a high-gain, low-
noise, wide-bandwidth microwave amplifier. It is capable of gains of 40 decibels or more, with 
bandwidths of over an octave. The twt was discussed in chapter 2 of NEETS, Module 11, Microwave 
Principles.) A typical microwave receiver contains an rf-IF group, local oscillator, demodulator, and 
amplifier. Both transmitters and receivers contain special circuits because of the high operating 
frequencies and critical frequency stability requirements. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Line-of-Sight System 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A line-of-sight (los) microwave system consists of one or more point-to-point hops as shown in 
figure 5-7. Each hop is designed so that it can be integrated into a worldwide communications network. 
Los systems have many characteristics. In these systems, propagation is only affected by changes in the 
troposphere. The distance between microwave system hop points ranges from 50 to 150 kilometers (31 to 
95 statute miles). These systems are capable of handling up to 600 4-kilohertz voice channels and can also 
transmit television. These signals can usually be transmitted with less than 10 watts of power. Both the 
transmit and receive antennas are horn-driven paraboloids that provide high gain and narrow beam 
widths. In some applications, as shown in figure 5-8, plane reflectors are used with the paraboloids. These 
systems are very reliable. They are designed to operate over 99 percent of the time. These systems are 
well adapted to multichannel communications and closed circuit television.

</p><p class="paragraph">Now let us take a look at another system. It is called the tropospheric-scatter microwave system. But 
first, you may want to review tropospheric propagation in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave 
Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tropospheric Scatter System 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A tropospheric-scatter (tropo-scatter) microwave system gets results similar to those of the line-of-
sight system. It does it in a different way. The los system uses towers to relay information. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The tropo system uses the turbulence in the layer between the troposphere and the stratosphere to 
bounce signals back to earth. This method provides several hops and communications beyond los. The 
propagation reliability and communications capability is the same. The transmission range is up to 800 
kilometers (500 statute miles). Transmitter output power may be up to 75 kilowatts depending on the 
operational requirements. The antennas are horn-driven paraboloids and may be as large as 50 to 60 feet 
in diameter. Figure 5-9 shows a typical tropospheric-scanner antenna. Remember that hf has a hop 
distance (skywave) of about 1,400 miles; the distance of one hop for a line-of-sight system is between 31 
and 95 miles. The tropospheric-scatter system conveniently fills the gap between these distances. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

systems. However, these weapons systems did not solve the basic combat command problems that 
confront our Navy. In combat, a fleet continues to be involved in close-range offense and defense. During 
close-range combat, the shipboard combat information center (CIC) is involved in complex tactical

assists them in directing their operations in time to intercept and destroy all potential enemy threats. The 
use of digital computers and digital data processing techniques reduces reaction time and increases force 
effectiveness. 
</p><p class="paragraph">NTDS uses a variety of equipment. This equipment includes transmitters, receivers, cryptographic 
equipment, high-speed digital computers, magnetic tapes, disks, and a variety of displays. Figure 5-10 
shows the NTDS equipment grouping and how it interfaces with the weapons and sensor systems of a 
ship. Figure 5-11 shows the NTDS system inputs and outputs. As you can see, large amounts and various 
types of information are provided to or taken from the NTDS. Now that you have seen the types of 
information associated with the NTDS, let's look at how this information is transmitted and used.

</p><h3 class="subsection">NTDS Data Transmission Subsystems 
</h3><p class="paragraph">NTDS uses three separate data transmission links to maintain tactical data communications between 
tactical units. Figure 5-12 illustrates these links. Each link is able to transfer data rapidly to other ships, 
aircraft, and shore facilities without the delay of human interface (link 14 receive is an exception to this). 
The data processing subsystem formats the messages for each of the data links. These messages are based 
on shipboard inputs (from displays, sensors, and other data links). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The automatic data communications links provide the operational commander with a high-speed, 
accurate mode of tactical communications. Link 11 provides high-speed, computer-to-computer transfer 
of tactical information, command orders, and unit status to all tactical data systems. View A shows you 
this configuration. The type of tactical information currently transferred is surface, subsurface, air, and 
EW track information. Data is provided on friendly, hostile, and unknown identity tracks. This broadcast 
originates through console button actions by the console operators. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Link 14 provides a means of transmitting track information to those units not capable of participating 
in the link 11 network. View B shows this network. This is a one-way broadcast of information. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Link 4A permits the computer to take control of the autopilot in an equipped aircraft. Also this link 
can control a plane under other situations. It may control a flight out to a strike area and return it to base 
without the need for pilot action. The pilot also has the option of overriding the link. The pilot may use 
the visual display to aid in understanding the intercept controller, or to totally ignore the link 4A </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PORTABLE-EQUIPMENT-5-14-">PORTABLE EQUIPMENT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Portable and pack radio sets must be lightweight, compact, and self-contained. Usually, these sets are 
powered by a battery or a hand generator, have low output power, and are either transceivers or 
transmitter-receivers. A transceiver consists of a transmitter and a receiver that share common circuits and 
are housed in the same case or cabinet. A transmitter-receiver is the combination of two separate pieces of 
equipment that are used together. Navy ships carry a variety of these radio sets for emergency and 
amphibious communications. The numbers and types of equipment vary according to the individual ship. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-EMERGENCY-EQUIPMENT-5-14-">EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT 
</h2><p class="paragraph">One piece of emergency equipment is shown in figure 5-14. It is a rugged emergency transmitter 
carried aboard ships and aircraft for use in lifeboats and life rafts. The transmitter operates on the 
international distress frequency (500 kilohertz) and the survival craft communications frequency (8,364 
kilohertz). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The complete radio transmitter, including the power supply, is contained in an aluminum cabinet that 
is airtight and waterproof. The cabinet is shaped to fit between the legs of the operator and has a strap for 
securing it in the operating position. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The only operating controls are a three-position selector switch and a push-button telegraph key. A 
hand crank screws into a socket in the top of the cabinet. The generator, automatic keying, and automatic 
frequency changing are all operated by turning the hand crank. While the hand crank is being turned, the 
set automatically transmits the distress signal SOS in Morse code. The code consists of six groups of SOS 
followed by a 20-second dash. It is transmitted alternately on 500 kilohertz and 8,364 kilohertz. The 
frequency automatically changes every 50 seconds. These signals are intended for reception by two 
groups of stations, each having distinct rescue functions. Direction-finding stations cooperating in long-
range rescue operations normally use 8,364 kilohertz, whereas aircraft or ships locally engaged in search 
and rescue missions use 500 kilohertz. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Besides the automatic feature, you can key the transmitter manually on 500 kilohertz only. This is 
done by means of a push-button telegraph key. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The equipment floats and is painted brilliant orange-yellow to provide good visibility against dark 
backgrounds. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A transceiver is shown in figure 5-15. It is portable, battery powered, and has two channels. It 
provides homing information and two-way voice communications between life rafts and searching ships 
and aircraft. This transceiver is a microminiature, solid-state, hand-held radio that operates on the 
121.5-megahertz and the 243-megahertz guard channels. The transceiver has four operating controls. 
These are the volume (VOL) control, the two-position FREQUENCY SELECTOR, the PUSH-TO-
TALK/ CODE button, and the three-position MODE switch. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The antenna is a rubber covered, omnidirectional, flexible whip antenna that is 7.74 inches long. The 
batteries supplied with the radio set are lithium D cells. Each cell is fused to protect against damage from 
external short circuits. Two cells are installed in the transceiver and four are packaged as spares.

operates in the vhf and uhf range. You can use any of 1,750 channels, spaced 200 kilohertz apart, in the 
225-400 megahertz range. Its mode of operation is AM voice and it supplies an average output power of 3 
watts. It was designed mainly for manpack (backpack) use, but it may also be used at a fixed station or in 
vehicles when certain accessories are added. When not in use, the equipment is disassembled and stowed

</p><p class="paragraph">Now that you have learned about portable equipment, let's look at one of the newest areas of 
communications. You are going to learn the fundamentals of how a laser works and how it may be used in 
the field of communications. 
</p><p class="question">Q9. What are the three main design considerations of portable equipment? 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LASERS-5-17-">LASERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The word LASER is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. The 
laser is widely used in industry, and experimental work is being done with it in communications. You will 
find a laser is similar to uhf and microwave power sources and could replace either of them in point-to-
point communications. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THEORY-OF-OPERATION-5-17-">THEORY OF OPERATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Lasers take energy at (or near) the visible light spectrum and convert it to a very narrow and intense 
beam in the same region. A close relative of the laser is the light emitting diode (LED). The LED takes dc 
or low frequency ac power and converts the energy into visible light. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The principle of the laser is somewhat similar to that of a very high-Q cavity resonator. Chapter 1 of 
NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles, explains cavity resonators. The laser is shock-excited by a 
spark transmitter. This transmitter is called a spark transmitter because it uses the discharge of a capacitor 
through an inductor and a spark gap as a source of rf. While the input energy of the laser covers a wide 
band of frequencies, the output is on one frequency. Energy outputs of the laser are either INCOHERENT 
or COHERENT. For example, if you turn on a transmitter with no modulation, you will get coherent 
radiation. When you connect a noise source to an antenna, the result is incoherent radiation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Lasers can be either cw or pulsed. Actually, lasers are little different from conventional oscillators. 
However, the way lasers convert energy from one form to another is quite different. In conventional 
oscillators, dc power from the collector is converted to rf energy. The frequency is for the most part 
independent of the molecular or atomic structure of the generator. This is not true for the laser. Laser 
conversion takes place directly within the molecular structure of a crystal or gas. The external circuits 
have little effect on actual output frequency. The fact that the light from an LED is always the same color 
results from similar conditions. In a laser, incoherent light excites the electrons in the atoms to higher 
energy levels than they normally would have. The new energy states are unstable and the electrons drop 
down to lower energy levels. Energy is then released in the form of light. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 5-18 shows the ends of the crystal or glass tube laser with light waves reflecting back and 
forth between two mirrored surfaces. One mirror is only partially reflective, and light energy is 
transmitted through it to form the light beam. You will find that power sources for lasers include flash 
tubes or, in the case of diode-type lasers, dc power supplies. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMMUNICATIONS-APPLICATIONS-5-18-">COMMUNICATIONS APPLICATIONS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">High-energy lasers have very small power losses. As a result, a laser with a 2- or 3-inch initial beam 
can be used to communicate directly with a distant planet. However, from a communications standpoint, 
they do have some drawbacks. While laser energy is capable of being formed into a very narrow beam, it 
is still subject to the same difficulties as any other form of light transmission. Fog and other adverse 
weather conditions can absorb the light. Small atmospheric temperature variations can cause deflection 
and scattering. An optical waveguide was designed to help overcome this problem. It consists of a thin 
dielectric fiber clothed by another dielectric coating several wavelengths thick. It has been successfully 
used to move the beam over considerable distances and around bends. The use of optical waveguides is 
known as FIBER OPTICS. A number of fibers can be paralleled to reduce the attenuation through the 
waveguide. This technique has resulted in an inexpensive telephone system with a bandwidth greater than 
that of previous methods. Researchers are attempting to develop a laser that will operate in the blue-green 
portion of the visible spectrum. Water offers little attenuation to the blue-green band of frequencies. 
Because of this, blue-green communications lasers could possibly penetrate the ocean to great depths. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This could give us a very secure undersea communications link.
