</h2><p class="paragraph">In today’s modern Navy, a large part of a ship’s, submarine’s, or aircraft’s ability to complete its
mission depends on the efficiency of sophisticated electronic systems. As the technician responsible for
these systems, you are the focal point in ensuring their reliability. In the event of a system failure, it is
your responsibility to repair the system and to do so in a timely manner. Whether you are troubleshooting
a faulty system or performing preventive maintenance, you are required to perform basic electronic
measurements on a regular basis. This chapter will acquaint you with various alternative methods of
performing measurements and discuss the relative merits and demerits of each method.
</p><p class="paragraph">No discussion of electronic test equipment or electronic measurements would be complete without
mentioning the Navy’s Metrology Calibration (METCAL) program. Figure 1-1 shows the METCAL
structure. Basically, the METCAL program is an elaborate quality control system designed to compare
your electronic test equipment with test equipment of much greater accuracy. When you submit your
piece of test equipment for calibration, it is compared with the calibration laboratory’s equipment
(referred to as STANDARDS), which are generally at least four times more accurate than yours. If your
equipment does not meet specifications, it is either repaired, adjusted, or rejected with an explanation of
why the calibration laboratory was unable to calibrate it. The accuracy of equipment at your local
calibration laboratory is ensured by calibration of the test equipment to the standards of the next higher
echelon calibration laboratory. The accuracies of test equipment at each higher echelon is increased by a
ratio of approximately 4 to 1.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Now that we have discussed the advantages of calibrated test equipment, let’s review the reason for
</p><p class="paragraph">all this concern. The fundamental electrical quantities of a circuit are voltage and current and are
dependent on the circuit characteristics of resistance, capacitance, and inductance. In addition to these
three individual characteristics, don’t forget that many electronic components exhibit more than one
circuit characteristic at the same time. An example would be a piece of coaxial cable that is engineered by
its manufacturer to meet characteristic specifications for impedance, capacitance, and inductance. But let’s
keep it simple and begin by covering voltage measurements.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

continuing.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-VOLTAGE-MEASUREMENTS-1-3-">VOLTAGE MEASUREMENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Most Navy technical manuals provide voltage charts that list correct voltages at all primary test
points in a piece of equipment. Voltage measurements, when compared with these charts, provide a
valuable aid in locating troubles quickly and easily. However, if the sensitivity of the test equipment
differs from that of the test equipment used in preparing the chart, the voltage measurements may not
reflect true circuit conditions. You must keep in mind that a voltmeter with low sensitivity used on a low
range may disturb circuits under test or provide a false indication. Most technical manuals will tell you
what type and model of test equipment was used to prepare the voltage charts. As a rule of thumb, the
input impedance of the voltmeter should exceed the impedance of the circuit by a ratio of at least 10 to 1.
Technicians have spent uncounted hours of wasted time because they have selected improper test
equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-2. The input impedance of your test equipment should exceed the impedance of the circuit under
test by what ratio?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DC-VOLTAGE-MEASUREMENTS-1-3-">DC VOLTAGE MEASUREMENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Direct current voltage may be steady, pulsating, or have ac superimposed on it. The average value of
a dc waveform depends on the symmetry of the wave and other aspects of the wave shape. It can vary
from 63.6% of peak value for a rectified full sine wave to 50% of peak value for a triangular wave. For a
superimposed sine wave, the average value can be zero. Regardless of whether the dc is steady, pulsating,
or the ac is superimposed on the dc, a rectifier form of measuring device will indicate its average value.
</p><p class="paragraph">Voltages are usually measured by placing the measuring device in parallel with the component or
circuit (load) to be measured. The measuring device should have an infinite internal resistance (input
impedance) so that it will absorb no energy from the circuit under test and, therefore, measure the true
voltage. The accuracy of the voltage measurement depends on the total resistance of the measuring device
compared to the load being measured. When the input impedance of the measuring device is 10 times
greater than the load being measured, the error usually can be tolerated. If this error cannot be tolerated, a
high input impedance measuring device, such as a vacuum tube voltmeter (vtvm), should be used.
Alternatively, using two voltmeters in series increases the voltage range and, because of the increase in
total voltmeter resistance, provides a more accurate measurement of voltage across the load. If the voltage
to be measured is sufficiently high, more than two similar voltmeters can be connected in series across the
load to provide greater accuracy; the total voltage measurement is the sum of the individual meter
indications.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-3. What are the advantages of using two voltmeters in series?
Multimeter Method
</p><p class="paragraph">A common piece of test equipment used in the Navy is the Simpson 260 analog multimeter, as
shown in figure 1-2. It is capable of measuring both ac and dc voltages of up to 5,000 volts.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-4
</p><p class="paragraph">Two obvious advantages of the Simpson 260 are its portability and ease of operation. Among its
disadvantages are its low input impedance and the inherent low accuracy associated with D’Arsonval
meter movements, which are used in the meter. When performing measurements with any analog
multimeter, remember that the most accurate readings are taken with the pointer midscale. You should
also be aware of inaccuracies introduced as a result of parallax. PARALLAX is defined as the apparent
displacement of the position of an object because of the difference between two points of view. In the
case of meters, this means the position of a meter’s pointer will appear to be at different positions on the
scale depending on the angle from which the meter is viewed. Some of the Simpson 260 and 270 series
multimeters have effectively eliminated the problem of parallax by incorporating a mirror on the scale
that accurately reflects the position of the pointer of the meter movement.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-4. At what point on a meter movement are the most accurate readings taken?
Oscilloscope Method
</p><p class="paragraph">A dc voltage measurement can be made with an oscilloscope, as shown in figure 1-3, that has a
direct-coupled deflection amplifier or terminals for connection directly to the deflection plates of the
cathode-ray tube. Measuring a dc voltage with an oscilloscope is convenient only under certain
circumstances; for example, when other measurements are being made on the same equipment with the
oscilloscope or when a vacuum tube voltmeter is not available and a high-impedance measuring device is
required.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Oscilloscopes have a high input impedance and normally will not load down the circuit under test.
However, oscilloscopes are primarily designed for waveform observation and are typically less accurate
than other pieces of test equipment used to measure dc voltages. A distinct advantage of the oscilloscope
is its ability to monitor the level of ac ripple voltage riding the dc voltage. This feature makes the
oscilloscope an indispensable aid in troubleshooting dc power supplies with excessive ripple caused by
component failure.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Digital Multimeter Method
</h3><p class="paragraph">Most analog voltmeters (that use D’Arsonval meter movements) in common use today are accurate to
approximately – 2% of full-scale reading. Most digital multimeters, as shown in figure 1-4, have a high
input impedance and are not likely to disturb the circuit being tested. The digital multimeter in most cases
provides an accuracy of at least – 0.1%.
</p><p class="paragraph">Digital multimeters display the reading numerically. These direct-reading displays, along with
automatic range- and polarity-changing features, eliminate the problem of parallax, reduce error and
tedium, and increase measurement speed. Data from these meters in digital format can also be processed</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">by computers, printers, tape and card punches, and magnetic-tape equipment. Digital multimeters are
typically compact and lightweight; many come with rechargeable batteries, making them ideal for
portable field use. The disadvantages are that they are not rugged and will not tolerate abuse and that
some models do not produce sufficient bias voltage to test a diode or transistor junction. The John Fluke
Model 77 A/N digital multimeter is presently being purchased by the Navy and will eventually phase out
the older and less accurate analog meters.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Differential Voltmeter Method
</h3><p class="paragraph">Using the differential voltmeter, as shown in figure 1-5, provides one of the most accurate methods
of measuring dc voltage. Typical accuracies attained by this method are – 0.005%. These extremely high
accuracies are achieved by the design of the voltmeter with precision internal reference voltages and
precision resistors. As discussed earlier in NEETS, module 6, Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes,
and Power Supplies, most differential voltmeters can be operated as transistor voltmeters (tvm) or as
differential null voltmeters. The tvm mode is used to measure the approximate voltage and polarity of the
unknown voltage being measured. The approximate voltage, as measured in the tvm mode, is then used to
make the initial range and mode switch selections for nulling the input voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">The advantages of using a differential voltmeter for measuring dc voltages are the extreme accuracy
and minimal circuit loading made possible by the high input impedance of the meter. However,
differential voltmeters are less portable, heavier, and require greater skill and time when performing
measurements than other types of voltmeters. Additionally, they require long warm-up periods and are
susceptible to variations in temperature and humidity.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-AC-VOLTAGE-MEASUREMENTS-1-7-">AC VOLTAGE MEASUREMENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">When ac voltage measurements are performed, the input impedance of the selected test equipment
determines the amount of energy removed from the circuit under test. If an ac meter is placed across a
high-impedance circuit, the meter may load the high-impedance circuit and disturb circuit conditions,
possibly to the point of causing the circuit to cease functioning. A dc electronic voltmeter, used in
conjunction with a rectifying probe, extracts only a small amount of energy from the circuit under test.
Another advantage of an electronic voltmeter over the analog voltmeter is that voltages of low values can
be accurately measured.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the circuit being measured is a relatively high-frequency circuit, the internal capacitance of an
analog voltmeter rectifier could produce a disturbance by detuning the circuit. Figure 1-6 depicts the
frequency response of a Simpson 260. Note the percent of error introduced at different frequencies. For
high-frequency voltage measurements, an electronic voltmeter or an oscilloscope should be used. The
sensitivity of the meter (or oscilloscope) determines the lowest voltage it can measure accurately, and the
shunt capacitance of its input determines the upper frequency limits. It should be clear that the frequency
response of a piece of test equipment is just as important as its range limitations. If you exceed the range
limitations of a meter, it will either "peg" the meter or belch out the smell of smoke that many of us are
intimately acquainted with. This, however, is not the case when you exceed the frequency limitations of
your test equipment. Your test equipment will normally show a response, but that response will be grossly
inaccurate. The lesson to be learned here is that you should be fully aware of the limitations of your test
equipment and adhere to them.

</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-6. The frequency response of test equipment refers to what aspect of ac voltage measurements?
Multimeter Method
</p><p class="paragraph">As previously stated, an analog multimeter’s usefulness is limited by its low input impedance and
poor accuracy (typically – 2%). However, rugged construction and ease of operation make analog
multimeters extremely useful whenever poor accuracy and low input impedance can be tolerated. When
performing ac voltage measurements with a multimeter, be certain that the frequency of the signal being
measured falls within the upper and lower frequency limitations of the meter.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Oscilloscope Method
</h3><p class="paragraph">A major advantage of using an oscilloscope for ac voltage measurements is that the waveform can be
observed; consequently, errors in measuring complex peak voltages are minimized. An oscilloscope may
be used as a high-impedance ac voltmeter. In standard oscilloscopes, the vertical amplifier input
impedance is generally greater than 1 megohm, making it possible to measure voltages in high-impedance
circuits. If the signal is applied directly to the plates, rather than at the vertical amplifier input, the input
impedance is increased considerably.
</p><p class="paragraph">Voltage measurements are most easily made when the deflection of the trace extends across the
major portion of the oscilloscope screen; whenever possible, the trace should cover at least 60% of the
vertical viewing area of the screen. If the amplitude of the measured voltage is very low, the trace
dimensions may be small. If a voltage to be measured is large and cannot be attenuated to a usable value
by attenuation circuits within the oscilloscope, an external resistive or capacitive voltage divider can be
used. Such voltage dividers are often furnished with oscilloscope test sets and are called HIGH
VOLTAGE PROBES. When the voltage of pulses or other complete waveforms is being measured, the
high voltage probe selected must be so designed as not to distort the measured signal. Most probes have
adjustable (compensating) capacitors that are used to adjust the symmetry of the displayed waveform.
You adjust the probe by monitoring either the calibrator output of the oscilloscope or a known good
signal and adjusting the probe for a symmetrical display. Oscilloscopes are calibrated to display peak-to-
peak values. To determine the rms voltage of a sinusoidal signal, divide the number of graticule units
from the positive to the negative peaks by two and multiply this value by 0.707. When using the
oscilloscope for ac voltage measurements, ensure the upper frequency range of the oscilloscope is not
exceeded; otherwise, inaccurate values will be displayed. Most commonly used oscilloscopes have a
frequency response from dc up to 100 megahertz.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-7. Ideally, an oscilloscope presentation should cover what vertical portion of the screen?
Digital Multimeter Method
</p><p class="paragraph">As previously mentioned, digital multimeters present a high input impedance to the circuit under test
and are fairly accurate. Many earlier models had very limited frequency responses. Even today the upper
frequency limitations of digital multimeters vary from 20 kilohertz to over 300 kilohertz, depending on
the model. Their upper frequency limitations can, however, be significantly extended by using optional rf
probes. When you perform ac voltage measurements with a digital multimeter, remember that they are
true rms indicating devices.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Differential Voltmeter Method
</h3><p class="paragraph">Most differential voltmeters can be used to measure both ac and dc voltages. The differential
voltmeter method of measuring ac voltage is the most accurate of the common measurement techniques.
Typical accuracies are – 0.05% when operated in the ac mode.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CURRENT-MEASUREMENTS-1-9-">CURRENT MEASUREMENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Unless an ammeter is already an integral part of the circuit under test, current measurements are
rarely taken. In the case of a high-resistance circuit, it will contain such a small amount of current that it
cannot be measured accurately with ordinary field test equipment. In lower resistance circuits, current
measurements can be taken only if the ammeter is placed in series with the circuit under test. These
measurements require that a circuit connection be unsoldered or otherwise opened to insert the meter in
series with the circuit. An easier method you may use to obtain a current measurement is to take a voltage
measurement across a known resistance and calculate the current with Ohm’s law. The accuracy of
current measurements depends on the internal resistance of the meter as compared with the resistance of
the external circuit. If the total circuit current is decreased by increasing the load, then the percentage of
error will decrease. Therefore, greater accuracy is obtained if the meter resistance is considerably less
than the load resistance. A method of obtaining greater accuracy of current measurement is to decrease
the total internal meter resistance with respect to load resistance. This is accomplished by connecting two
ammeters in parallel with each other and in series with the circuit in which the current is being measured.
Additional ammeters may be connected in parallel in the same manner for increased accuracy. This
method also increases the range of measurements that can be taken. The arithmetical sum of the
indications of all the parallel meters represents the total current flow in the circuit. You should note that
this is not a common test method and that your test equipment may be damaged if connected incorrectly.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MULTIMETER-METHOD-1-9-">MULTIMETER METHOD
</h2><p class="paragraph">As previously mentioned, current measurements are usually taken by breaking the current path of the
circuit under test and electrically inserting a meter in series. This is normally accomplished by
disconnecting a wire from a terminal or unsoldering one end of a component and electrically inserting the
meter in series using the meter leads. This method is both time consuming and usually requires the use of
a soldering iron, which can damage components. Most analog multimeters cannot be used for measuring
ac current and are only accurate to within – 2% on dc ranges.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-8. What are the advantages of connecting ammeters in parallel when performing current
measurements?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DIGITAL-MULTIMETER-METHOD-1-9-">DIGITAL MULTIMETER METHOD
</h2><p class="paragraph">Unlike the analog multimeter, the digital multimeter will measure ac current as well as dc current.
Again, current measurements are taken by breaking the current path and inserting the meter in series.
Regardless of whether you’re using an analog multimeter or digital multimeter, this procedure for
measuring current is time consuming. However, there is a major advantage to be gained by using the
digital multimeter — its high degree of accuracy. The Fluke 8000A digital multimeter, for example, is

milliammeter for measuring current. Although not used very often by Navy technicians, current probes
are available. The primary advantage in using a current probe is that it does not need to be in series with
the current being measured. Unsoldering wires or connections to terminals is not necessary; current
probes are designed to be clamped onto insulated conductors. They are able to sense, through inductive
action, the magnitude of the current flowing in the conductor. Current probes are designed for performing
small ac current measurements. Also, when you use them in conjunction with current probe amplifiers,
the capabilities of the current probe are extended to measurement of both ac and dc currents with large
magnitudes. Current probes are extremely useful when you measure the current drain on a power supply,
start-up current of a motor, or current flow in relays. These probes can be divided into three basic types:
passive, active, and Hall effect. Each type has advantages and disadvantages peculiar to its method of
operation. Prior to using a current probe, you should thoroughly understand its instructions.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

OSCILLOSCOPE METHOD
</p><p class="paragraph">Current can be measured with an oscilloscope by shunting the input terminals with a low-value
resistor. The input terminals must then be connected in series with the circuit being tested. The value of
the resistor must be small enough not to interfere with the operation of the circuit under test. At the same
time, it must be large enough that the voltage developed will cause adequate deflection of the oscilloscope
trace. For example, if an oscilloscope with a vertical deflection sensitivity of 0.1volt rms per centimeter
(cm) is used in conjunction with a 10-ohm shunt resistor to measure a 25-milliamp current, the vertical
trace will be deflected 2.5 centimeters, as shown in the following example:

The calibration signal current can then be calculated by means of Ohm’s law. Since the oscilloscope

</h2><p class="paragraph">A high percentage of technical manuals contain point-to-point resistance charts that list correct
resistance readings for major test points. These resistance charts are extremely useful when you
troubleshoot faulty equipment. Without them, equipment resistance measurements within a complicated
circuit would not mean much. Many circuits contain other circuit elements, such as capacitors, coils, or
other resistors in parallel with the resistances being measured. This, of course, is a possible source of
measurement error that you eliminate when you disconnect or unsolder one side of the resistor or a group
of resistors under test.
</p><p class="paragraph">You should be thoroughly familiar with the calibration of your ohmmeter. Analog meters are
typically more accurate and easier to read at midscale. With the exception of bridge circuits, a meter may
provide only approximate resistance readings. However, these readings may be adequate when you also
consider the wide tolerances of resistors themselves. An ohmmeter that you use in field testing should be
portable, convenient, and simple to operate - factors that usually are more important than extreme
accuracy.
</p><p class="paragraph">When an ohmmeter is used, completely de-energize the circuit under test and remove any current-
sensitive elements before the resistance measurement is performed. Low-resistance measurements that
require precision readings should be taken with a bridge type of instrument.

zero the meter. The meter indication varies greatly depending on the resistance of the test leads, the
condition of the batteries within the meter, and the resistance range selected on the multimeter. The meter
should be zeroed every time you change range settings. To zero a multimeter you short the leads together
and adjust the meter for a full-scale deflection. Scale markings are spaced closer together toward the

capacitor may be tested to determine whether it is open or shorted. Ensure that capacitors are properly
discharged before you test them; otherwise, damage to the multimeter may occur. When an ohmmeter is
placed in series with a capacitor, the changing current will cause a meter deflection that is proportional to
the capacitance. The deflection obtained is compared with the deflection from a similar capacitor of
known value. This deflection may be small or large, depending on the type and size of the capacitor and
the voltage of the battery within the meter. An external series battery will increase the sensitivity of the

DIGITAL MULTIMETER
</p><p class="paragraph">The two major advantages of using a digital multimeter are its ease of operation and accuracy. Most
digital multimeters can be ordered with an optional battery pack, which makes them just as portable as an
analog multimeter. Another advantage is that their LED or LCD readouts are much easier to read than the
scale on an analog multimeter. Digital multimeters also are ideally suited for measuring sensitive devices
that might otherwise be damaged by the excessive current associated with analog multimeters —
maximum current flow through the component being tested is typically limited to less than 1 milliamp.
When measuring small values of resistances, remember to consider the resistance of your test leads. Most
digital multimeters cannot be zeroed in the way analog multimeters can. With digital multimeters, you
have to short the leads, read the lead resistance displayed, and then subtract the reading from subsequent
component measurements that you make.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RCL-BRIDGES-1-14-">RCL BRIDGES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The 250DE+1325 is a typical resistance, capacitance, inductance (rcl) bridge. Like the vtvm, the rcl
bridge has several disadvantages. It requires ac power and a lengthy warm-up period, and its accuracy is
limited to – 2%. The rcl bridge uses a tuning indicator electron tube, commonly referred to as the bridge's
"eye," and an internal arrangement of resistors that form a Wheatstone bridge. As discussed in NEETS,
module 16, the rcl bridge can be a time-consuming method of performing resistance measurements.
</p><p class="paragraph">Difficulty may be experienced when you attempt to measure wire-wound resistors. To obtain a sharp
balance on the indicator, you can shunt the resistor with a variable capacitor and adjust the capacitor for
the clearest indication. The resistance measurement will not be affected by this reactance neutralization.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAPACITOR-MEASUREMENTS-1-15-">CAPACITOR MEASUREMENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Capacitance is that property of a circuit that produces an electrostatic field when two conducting
bodies separated by a dielectric material have a potential applied to them. Capacitors are made by
compressing an insulating material (dielectric) between two conductors (plates). The farad is the basic
measurement of capacitance. It is dependent upon the area of the plates, the distance between the plates,
and the type of dielectric used. Electrically, the farad is a measure of 1 coulomb of potential charged by 1
volt. A coulomb (the amount of current flow maintained at 1 ampere that passes a given point of a circuit
in 1 second) is a large charge. Most capacitors are measured in millionths of a farad (microfarad),
expressed as µ F, or in one-millionth of a microfarad (picofarad), expressed as pF.
</p><p class="paragraph">Capacitors incur various losses as a result of such factors as resistance in the conductors (plates) or
leads, current leakage, and dielectric absorption, all of which affect the power factor of the capacitor.
Theoretically, the power factor of an ideal capacitor should be zero; however, the losses listed above
cause the power factors of practical capacitors to range from near 0 to a possible 100%. The average
power factor for good capacitors, excluding electrolytics, is 2% to 3%. Current leakage, which is an
inverse function of frequency, is important only at the lower frequencies and becomes negligible at higher
frequencies. Dielectric absorption (sometimes referred to as dielectric viscosity) results in losses that
produce heat. The effect of this type of loss is the same as resistance in series with the capacitor.
</p><p class="paragraph">You have probably learned the hard way that some capacitors can retain a charge long after the
voltage has been removed. The electrical charge retained by capacitors in de-energized electronic circuits
is, in many cases, sufficient to cause a lethal shock. Be sure you and those working with you consider this
hazard before performing any type of maintenance on any electrical or electronic circuit and before
making connections to a seemingly dead circuit. Use extreme caution prior to working on or near de-
energized circuits that employ large capacitors. Be safe—discharge and ground all high-voltage
capacitors and exposed high-voltage terminal leads by using only an authorized shorting probe, as shown
in figure 1-11. Repeat discharge operations several times to make sure that all high-voltage terminations
are completely discharged. It is of the utmost importance that you use only an authorized safety shorting
probe to discharge the circuits before performing any work on them. An authorized general-purpose
safety shorting probe for naval service application may be requisitioned using the current stock number
listed in the ELECTRONICS INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE BOOK (EIBM), General
NAVSEA 0967-LP-000-0100, Section 3, Safety Equipment. Certain electronic equipment are provided
with built-in, special-purpose safety shorting probes. These probes are not considered general purpose.
Use them only with the equipment for which they are provided and only in a manner specified by the
technical manuals for the equipment. It is considered to be poor practice to remove them for use
elsewhere.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

behind the protective shield, touch the end of the metal rod to the points to be discharged. Touch each
point several times to ensure that the circuit is completely discharged. Be extremely careful that you do
not touch any of the metal parts of the safety shorting probe while touching the probe to the exposed "hot"
terminal. Don't develop a nonchalant or routine attitude about these procedures. It pays to be safe; use the
safety shorting probe with care.
</p><p class="paragraph">Large capacitors, dormant in storage, can also develop a large static charge. This charge is caused by
environmental conditions such as a close proximity to an rf field. An easy way to avoid this condition is
to short the stored capacitor's terminals with a piece of wire before putting it in storage. Remember to
remove the wire before installing the capacitor. If you receive a large capacitor that is not shorted, short
the terminals together. Remember, CHARGED CAPACITORS CAN KILL.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-12. Charged capacitors can kill. True or false?
BRIDGE-TYPE MEASUREMENTS
</p><p class="paragraph">Capacitor tests involving quality and value must be made in the course of everyday troubleshooting.
You must make the important decision of whether to reject or continue to use a certain capacitor after it
has been tested. Capacitance measurements are usually accomplished by either a bridge-type or a
reactance-type capacitance meter. The bridge-type capacitance meter is much more accurate than the
reactance-type meter. You may want to review rcl bridges in chapter 1 of NEETS, module 16, before
reading further. Capacitance tolerances vary more widely than resistance tolerances and are dependent
upon the type of capacitor, the capacitance value, and the voltage rating. The results of capacitance tests
must be evaluated to determine whether a particular capacitor will fulfill the requirements of the circuit in
which it is used.
</p><p class="paragraph">The power factor of a capacitor is important because it is an indication of the various losses
attributable to the dielectric, such as current leakage and dielectric absorption. Current leakage is of
considerable importance, especially in electrolytic capacitors.

completing the capacitance balance, and its dial reading indicates a loss figure for the capacitor under test.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-13. Which is more accurate, the bridge- or reactance-type meter?
REACTANCE-TYPE MEASUREMENTS
</p><p class="paragraph">The reactance type of capacitance measuring equipment makes use of the following principle: If an
ac voltage (usually 6.3 volts) at a fixed frequency is applied across a capacitor and resistor in series, the
voltage drop produced across the reactance of the capacitor by the resulting current flow is inversely
proportional to the capacitance. The voltage drop is used to actuate a meter that is calibrated in
capacitance values. This test equipment gives approximate values only and, like the ohmmeter, is used
mostly when portability and speed are more important than precision. The accuracy of the reactance-type
measurement is less for capacitors that have a high power factor. In capacitors with high power factors,
the losses incurred effectively place a certain amount of resistance in series with the capacitive reactance.
The effect of this resistance, when the capacitor is measured, is to cause a greater voltage drop across the
capacitor. This drop is not because of the reactance above, but is the result of the impedance, which of</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

wider variation of capacitance value than is indicated by their rated tolerances.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A current flowing through a conductor produces a magnetic field around that conductor. If the
conductor is formed into a coil, a stronger magnetic field is set up. The relationship between the strength
of the field and the intensity of the current causing it is expressed by the inductance of the coil (or
conductor). When the current producing the magnetic field ceases, the energy of the magnetic field is
returned in part to the circuit source in the form of a reverse current. Inductance, then, is the ability of a
coil to function as a storehouse of energy in magnetic form and is determined by the shape and
dimensions of the coil. Inductance is measured in henries, millihenries, or microhenries. Inductors can be
described generally as circuit elements used to introduce inductive reactance into ac circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">An inductor is essentially a coil of wire wound around a form using a core of air, magnetic metal, or

layered with air or metallic cores. Since comparatively low values of inductance are required, this type of
coil is very compact, and relatively high values of Q are obtained.
</p><p class="paragraph">At frequencies in the lf and mf regions of the frequency spectrum, single-layered, universal, spiral,
and other types of windings are used. When size is a factor, the more compact windings are preferred to
the single-layered type of coil. At frequencies below 500 kilohertz, the single-layered type is too large for
practical use; therefore, the more compact types are used exclusively.
</p><p class="paragraph">The inherent resistance of the conductor with which an inductor is wound is the most important
factor contributing to the losses of the inductor. Losses caused by this resistance increase with frequency.
This results in a concentration of current near the outer surface of the wire, called SKIN EFFECT. Skin
effect is negligible at low frequencies, but can be an important factor at high frequencies. Other
contributing factors to inductor losses are (1) eddy currents set up in the core and surrounding objects (if
they are conductors); (2) the dielectric properties of the form used for the coil and surrounding objects;
and (3) hysteresis in the core and surrounding objects, if they are magnetic metals. Losses occur as a
result of the dielectric properties of the coil form because of the distributed capacitance of the inductor
(for example, between turns and between the terminals and leads). To some extent the core and
surrounding objects serve as a dielectric of the distributed capacitance, and the resulting dielectric losses
contribute to the overall losses of the inductor.
</p><p class="paragraph">As we discussed earlier, an inductor has the ability to act as a storehouse of magnetic energy.
However, because of the various loss factors described above, all of the energy stored in the magnetic
field is not returned to the source when the applied voltage decreases to zero. The losses of an inductor
may be represented by an equivalent series resistance. The value that it would dissipate would be an
amount of energy equal to the total amount dissipated by the inductor. The losses of an inductor may be
expressed in terms of the ratio of its inductive reactance to its equivalent series resistance. This ratio is
referred to as the Q of the inductor and is stated in equation form as shown below:

HAY BRIDGE
</p><p class="paragraph">Inductance measurements are seldom required in the course of troubleshooting. However, in some
cases inductance measurements are useful and instruments are available for making this test. Many
capacitance test sets can be used to measure inductance. Most manufacturers of capacitance test sets
furnish inductance conversion charts if the test equipment scale is not calibrated to read the value of
inductance directly. For the measurement of inductance, the following basic types of test equipment
circuitry are used: (1) the bridge-circuit type, which is the most accurate, and (2) the reactance type,
which is often an additional test circuit incorporated into another piece of test equipment to increase its
utility. The measurement of capacitance using the capacitance-inductance-resistance bridge instrument
was discussed. Since the measurement of capacitance and inductance are interrelated, the existing
capacitance standards and loss controls of this test equipment are used whenever possible. A wider range
of dissipation must be provided to accommodate the practical value of inductors. The 250DE+1325 (view
A of fig. 1-14), a typical rcl bridge and our reference in this discussion, uses two basic bridge circuits
(Hay bridge and Maxwell bridge) to accommodate the extensive range in inductor loss factors. You

equipment. This limitation is expressed on the front panel of the test equipment as follows: IF D&gt;0.05 ON
L(D)—REBALANCE ON L(Q) . In other words, if the dissipation of an inductor, as read on the D dial
when using the Hay bridge (FUNCTION switch set to L(D) position), exceeds 0.05, then you should
change to the Maxwell bridge (FUNCTION switch set to L(Q) position), which is discussed in the
following paragraph. The loss factor of the inductor under test is then balanced in terms of the Q of the
inductor.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The Maxwell bridge, shown in view C of figure 1-14, measures inductance by comparing it with a
capacitance and (effectively) two resistances.] This bridge circuit is employed for measuring inductances
having losses greater than 0.05 (expressed by the D dial reading). For such inductors it is necessary to
introduce, in place of the series control (D dial), a new loss control (Q dial), which shunts the standard
capacitor. This control, which becomes effective when the FUNCTION switch is turned to the L(Q)
position, is conveniently calibrated in values of Q, the storage factor of the inductor under measurement.
The balance for inductance is the same for either bridge circuit. This permits the use of the same markings
on the RANGE switch for both the L(D) and L(Q) positions of the FUNCTION switch.
REACTANCE MEASURING EQUIPMENT
</p><p class="paragraph">The reactance type of inductance measuring equipment makes use of the following principle: If an ac
voltage of fixed frequency is applied across an inductor (and a resistor in series), the voltage drop
produced across the reactance of the inductor by the resulting current flow is directly proportional to the
value of the inductance. An inductance measurement using the reactance method is identical to
capacitance measurements using the same method, except that current flow is directly proportional to the
value of inductance, rather than inversely proportional as in the case of capacitance. It follows then that if
a reactance-type capacitance measuring equipment is provided with a chart that converts the capacitance
readings to equivalent inductance values and a proper range multiplying factor, the same test setup can be
used to measure both capacitance and inductance. In practice, test equipment using the reactance method
for capacitance measurements usually provides an inductance conversion chart. Because the current
flowing through the inductance under test is directly proportional to the value of inductance, the
reciprocals of the capacitance range multipliers must be used; for example, a multiplier of 0.1 becomes
</p><h3 class="subsection">and a multiplier of 100 becomes
</h3><p class="paragraph">The reactance-type equipment gives approximate values only. Like the analog multimeter, it is used
only when portability and speed are more important than precision. If the ohmic resistance of the inductor
is low, the inductance value obtained from the conversion chart can be used directly. If the ohmic value
(as measured with an ohmmeter) is appreciable, a more accurate value of inductance can be obtained by
use of the following formula:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">If you do not have a 250DE+1325 at your disposal, the inductance of a coil can be determined by
using a vtvm and a decade resistance box, as shown in figure 1-15. In the following example the
inductance of an unknown coil in the secondary winding of a 6.3-volt filament transformer will be
determined with a vtvm and decade resistance box. The unknown coil must be connected in series with
the decade resistance box. The voltage across the decade box and across the coil must be monitored as the
decade box is adjusted. When equal voltages are reached, read the resistance of the decade box. Since the
voltage across the inductor equals the voltage across the decade box, the XL of the coil must be equal to
the resistance read on the decade box. For example, assume that the resistance reading on the decade box
is 4 kilohms and the frequency is 60 hertz. This must mean that the XL of the coil is also equal to 4,000

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY
</h1><p class="paragraph">This chapter has presented information on basic measurements. The information that follows
summarizes the important points of this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">The five basic measurements are VOLTAGE, CURRENT, RESISTANCE, CAPACITANCE,
and INDUCTANCE. The accuracy of all measurements depends upon YOUR SKILL as a technician and
the accuracy of your TEST EQUIPMENT.
</p><p class="paragraph">Accuracy of different types of test equipment varies greatly and depends on design characteristics,
tolerances of individual components, and YOUR KNOWLEDGE of test equipment applications.
</p><p class="paragraph">The METCAL program ensures that your calibrated test equipment meets established specifications.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most equipment technical manuals contain VOLTAGE CHARTS which list correct voltages that
should be obtained at various test points.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is important to remember that the INPUT IMPEDANCE of your test equipment must be high
enough to prevent circuit loading.
</p><p class="paragraph">When you are performing ac voltage measurements, an additional consideration that greatly affects
the accuracy of your measurements is the FREQUENCY LIMITATIONS of your test equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">Ac and dc CURRENT MEASUREMENTS can be performed using a wide variety of test equipment.
Most current measurements require you to break the current path by unsoldering components and wires
and inserting an ammeter in series with the current path. One alternative method is to compute (using
OHM’S LAW) the current through a circuit by measuring the voltage drop across a known resistance.
Another alternative is to use a CURRENT PROBE that requires no unsoldering.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When performing resistance measurements, your primary concerns are the RANGE AND DEGREE
OF ACCURACY of your test equipment. In most instances, an analog multimeter is accurate enough to
perform basic troubleshooting. When measuring extremely large resistances, you are sometimes required
to use a MEGGER or a DIFFERENTIAL VOLTMETER.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

equipment does not exceed the current limitations of the device being tested.
</p><p class="paragraph">Capacitance and inductance measurements are seldom required in the course of troubleshooting.
These measurements are usually performed with various types of BRIDGES or with a reactance type of
measuring device. The bridge -measuring techniques are more commonly used and are more accurate
than reactance types of measurements.

</h2><p class="paragraph">It is imperative that you be able to troubleshoot an equipment failure to the component level. In the
majority of cases, Navy technicians are expected to troubleshoot and identify faulty components. This
chapter, "Component Testing," will acquaint you with alternative methods of testing various components
and their parameters. A quick glance at the Navy’s mission and concept of operation explains why we, in
most cases, must be able to troubleshoot to the faulty component level. A ship must be a self-sustaining
unit when deployed. Storage space is a primary consideration on most ships and a limiting factor for
storage of bulky items or electronic modules as ready spares. Therefore, it is practical to store only
individual components common to a great number of equipment types. This of course, limits the larger
replacement modules available to you during troubleshooting.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-1. Why are most ships limited in their ability to stock replacement modules for repair of electronic
equipment?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TESTING-ELECTRON-TUBES-2-1-">TESTING ELECTRON TUBES
</h2><p class="paragraph">In equipment that uses vacuum tubes, faulty tubes are responsible for more than 50% of all electronic
equipment failures. As a result, testing of electronic tubes is important to you. You can determine the
condition of a tube by substituting an identical tube known to be good for the questionable one. However,
indiscriminate substitution of tubes is to be avoided for at least the following two reasons: (1) detuning of
circuits may result and (2) a tube may not operate properly in a high-frequency circuit even though it
performs well in a low-frequency circuit. Therefore, your knowledge of tube-testing devices and their
limitations, as well as correct interpretation of the test results obtained, is indispensable for accurate and
rapid maintenance.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
<div class="page mainpage" id="41"><div class="centered">
            <div class="pagination">

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">2-2
</p><p class="paragraph">Because the operating capabilities and design features of a tube are demonstrated by its electrical
characteristics, a tube is tested by measuring those characteristics and comparing them with representative
values established for that type of tube. Tubes that read abnormally high or low with respect to the
standard are suspect. Practical considerations, which take into account the limitations of the tube test in
predicting actual tube performance in a particular circuit, make it unnecessary to use complex and costly
test equipment with laboratory accuracy. For most applications, testing of a single tube characteristic is
good enough to determine tube performance. Some of the more important factors affecting the life
expectancy of an electron tube are listed below:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• The circuit function of the tube
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Deterioration of the cathode coating
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• A decrease in emission of impregnated emitters in aging filament-type tubes
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Defective seals that permit air to leak into the envelope and oxidize the emitting surface
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• Internal short circuits and open circuits caused by vibration or excessive voltage
</h3><p class="paragraph">If the average receiving tube is not overdriven or operated continuously at maximum rating, it can
have a life of at least 2,000 hours before the filament opens. Because of the expansion and contraction of
tube elements during the process of heating and cooling, electrodes may lean or sag, which causes
excessive noise or microphonics to develop. Other electron-tube defects are cathode-to-heater leakage and
nonuniform electron emission of the cathode. These common tube defects contribute to about 50% of all
electronic equipment failures. For this reason you should immediately eliminate any tube known to be
faulty. However, avoid blind or random replacement of good tubes with fresh spares. The most common
cause of tube failure is open filaments. Evidence of a tube defect is often obvious when the filament is
open in glass-envelope tubes. You will also notice the brighter-than-normal cherry-red glow of the plate
when the plate current is excessive. Also, when the tube becomes gassy or when arcing occurs between
electrodes, you will probably have visual indication. Metal-encased tubes can be felt for warmth to
determine if the heater is operating. You can tap a tube while it is operating in a circuit to reveal an aural
indication of loose elements within the tube or microphonics, which are produced by loose elements.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most tubes are extremely fragile and subject to damage during shipment. When you replace a tube,
never make the assumption that the new tube is good because it’s new. You should always test tubes
before installing them.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-2. What is the most common cause of electron tube failure?
SUBSTITUTION METHODS
</p><p class="paragraph">Substituting with a tube known to be in good condition is a simple method of testing a questionable
tube. However, in high-frequency circuits tube substitution should be carried out in a logical sequence.
Replace tubes one at a time so that you can observe the effect of differences in interelectrode capacitance
in the substituted tubes on tuned circuits. The tube substitution test method cannot be used to advantage in
locating more than one faulty tube in a single circuit for two reasons: (1) If both an rf amplifier tube and
IF amplifier tube are defective in a receiver, replacing either one will not correct the trouble; and (2) if all
the tubes are replaced, there is no way for you to know what tubes were defective. Under these
conditions, using test equipment designed for testing the quality of a tube saves you valuable time.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A representative field type of electron tube tester designed to test all common low-power tubes is
shown in figure 2-1. The tube test conditions are as close as possible to actual tube operating conditions
and are programmed on a prepunched card. The card switch (S101, fig. 2-1) automatically programs the
tube test conditions when it is actuated by a card. A card compartment on the front panel of the tester
provides storage for the most frequently used cards. The cover of the tester (not shown) contains the
operating instructions, the brackets for storing the technical manual, the power cord, the calibration cell
for checking the meter and short tests, the calibration cards, the blank cards, and a steel hand punch.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Front Panel
</h3><p class="paragraph">When a prepunched card is fully inserted into the card switch (S101), a microswitch is actuated that
energizes a solenoid, causing the card switch contacts to complete the circuit. The card switch has 187
single-pole, single-throw switches arranged in 17 rows with 11 switches in each row. The card is used to
push the switches closed; thus, the absence of a hole in the card is required to actuate a switch.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

numerical readings. The three lower scales, numbered 1, 2, and 3, are read for LEAKAGE, QUALITY,
and GAS, respectively. Each numbered scale includes green and red areas marked GOOD and
REPLACE. Inside a shield directly in front of the meter are five neon lamps (DS301 through DS305),
which indicate shorts between tube elements.
</p><p class="paragraph">The number 2 pushbutton (MP6) is used for transconductance, emission, and other quality tests
(described later). The number 3 pushbutton (MP7) is used to test for the presence of gas in the tube
envelope. The number 4 pushbutton (MP8) is used for tests on dual tubes. A neon lamp (DS203) lights
when pushbutton number 4 is to be used. Eleven tube test sockets are located on the panel, plus tube pin
straighteners for the 7- and 9-pin miniature tubes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The power ON-OFF spring-return toggle switch (S105) turns the tester on by energizing a line relay.
The pilot light (DS107) lights when this relay closes. Above the power ON-OFF switch are five fuses.
Fuses F101, F201, and F202 protect circuits in the tester not protected by other means and have neon
lamps to indicate when they have blown. Fuses F102 and F103 protect both sides of the power line.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Auxiliary Compartment
</h3><p class="paragraph">A group of auxiliary controls covered by a hinged panel is used for special tests and for calibration
of the tester. Two of these controls, labeled SIGNAL CAL (R152 and R155, fig. 2-2), are used with
special test cards for adjusting the regulation and amplitude of the signal voltage. A pushbutton labeled
CATH ACT (S302D) is used for making cathode activity tests. When this button is pressed, DS106 on the
front panel (fig. 2-1) lights, and the filament voltage of the tube under test is reduced by 10%. Results of
the test are read as a change in reading on the numerical meter scale.

</p><p class="paragraph">Pushbutton S302E and potentiometers R401 and R405 (fig. 2-2) are used for balancing the
transconductance (Gm) bridge circuit under actual tube operating current. Pressing S302E removes the
grid signal and allows a zero balance to be made with one potentiometer or the other, depending upon
whether the tube under test is passing high or low plate current. Lamp DS108 on the front panel lights
when S302E is pressed. Pushbutton S302C is used for checking grid-to-cathode shorts at a sensitivity
much higher than the normal tests. Results of this test are indicated by the short test lamps on the front
panel.
</p><p class="paragraph">Certain special tests require the use of a continuously adjustable auxiliary power supply. By pressing
pushbutton S302B, you may use meter M301 to read the voltage of the auxiliary power supply on meter
M301. This voltage may be adjusted by the use of the potentiometer R142. The rest of the potentiometer
controls are calibration controls and are adjusted by the use of special calibration cards and a calibration
test cell.
</p><p class="paragraph">All circuits in the tester, except the filament supply, are electronically regulated to compensate for
line voltage fluctuations. The filament supply voltage is adjusted by pressing pushbutton S302A and
rotating the filament standardization adjustment switch S106 until meter M301 reads midscale.
Program Cards
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuits to be used in testing are selected by a prepunched card. These cards are made of tough
vinyl plastic material. The tube numbers are printed in color on the tabs of the cards and also at the edge
of the card for convenience in filing. A special card is provided to use as a marker when a card is removed
for use. Blank cards are provided so that additional test cards may be punched for new tubes that are
developed or to replace cards that have become unserviceable.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Operation
</h3><p class="paragraph">Before operating the tester for the first time, and periodically thereafter, you should calibrate it using
the calibration test cards as described in the equipment technical manual.
</p><p class="paragraph">NORMAL TESTS.—The tester is equipped with a three-conductor power cord, one wire of which
is chassis ground. It should be plugged into a grounded 105- to 125-volt, 50- to 400-hertz outlet.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before operating the tester, open the auxiliary compartment (fig. 2-2) and ensure that the
FILAMENT STD ADJ and the Gm BAL knobs are in the NOM position. The GRID SIG and CATH
ACT buttons (S302E and S302D) should be up and lamps DS108 and DS106 on the front panel should be
out.
</p><p class="paragraph">Turn on the tester and allow it to warm up for 5 to 10 minutes, then press the CARD REJECT
KNOB (fig. 2-1) down until it locks. If a nontest card is installed in the card switch, remove it. This card
is used to keep the switch pins in place during shipment and should be inserted before transporting the
tester.
</p><p class="paragraph">Plug the tube to be tested into its proper socket. (Use the pin straighteners before plugging in 7- and
9-pin miniature tubes.) Select the proper card or cards for the tube to be tested. Insert the card selected
into the slot in the card switch until the CARD REJECT KNOB pops up. The card will operate the tester
only if it is fully inserted and the printing is up and toward the operator. Do not put paper or objects other
than program cards into the card switch, because they will jam the switch contacts. If the overload shuts
off the tester when the card is inserted in the switch, check to see that the proper card is being used for the
tube under test and that the tube under test has a direct interelement short.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

test lamps is an indication of an interelement short. If the short test lamps remain dark, no interelement
shorts exist within the tube. If a short exists between two or more elements, the short test lamp or lamps
connected between these elements remain dark, and the remaining lamps light. The abbreviations for the
tube elements are located on the front panel just below the short test shield so that the neon lamps are
between them. This enables the operator to tell which elements are shorted. Heater-to-cathode shorts are
indicated as leakage currents on the #1 meter scale. If the meter reads above the green area, the tube
should be replaced. A direct heater-to-cathode short causes the meter to read full scale.
</p><p class="paragraph">To make the QUALITY test, push the number 2 button (fig. 2-1) and read the number 2 scale on
meter M301 to determine if the tube is good. (This test may be one of various types, such as
transconductance, emission, plate current, or voltage drop, depending upon the type of tube under test.)
</p><p class="paragraph">To test the tube for GAS, press the number 3 button and read the number 3 meter scale. The number
2 button also goes down when number 3 is pressed. If a dual tube having two identical sections is being
tested, the neon lamp (DS203) will light, indicating that both sections of the tube may be tested with one
card. To do this, check the tube for shorts, leakage, quality, and gas as described previously; then hold
down button number 4 and repeat these tests to test the second section of the tube. Dual tubes with
sections that are not identical require two cards for testing. A second card is also provided to make special
tests on certain tubes.
</p><p class="paragraph">AUXILIARY TEST.—As mentioned previously, two special tests (cathode activity and sensitive
grid shorts) may be made by use of controls located in the auxiliary compartment (fig. 2-2). The cathode
activity test (CATH ACT) is used to indicate the amount of useful life remaining in the tube. By reducing
the filament voltage by 10 percent and allowing the cathode to cool off slightly, the ability of the cathode
as an emitter of electrons can be estimated. This test is made in conjunction with the normal quality test.
</p><p class="paragraph">To make the CATH ACT test, allow the tube under test to warm up, press button number 2 (fig. 2-1),
and note the reading of scale number 2 on meter M301. Note also the numerical scale reading on M301.
Next, lock down the CATH ACT button (fig. 2-2), wait for about 1.5 minutes, then press button number 2
(fig. 2-1) again and note the numerical and number 2 scale readings on meter M301. The tube should be
replaced if the numerical reading on M301 differs from the first reading by more than 10 percent or if the
reading is in the red area on the number 2 scale.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is sometimes desirable to check certain tubes for shorts at a sensitivity greater than normal. To
make the SENSITIVE GRID SHORTS test, push S302C (fig. 2-2) and note if any short test lamps (fig.
2-1) light.
HIGH-POWER HF AMPLIFIER TUBE TESTS
</p><p class="paragraph">You normally test high-power amplifier tubes, which operate in the low-to-high frequency range, in
the transmitter in which they are to be used. When you operate the tube in a transmitter, its condition can
be determined by using built-in meters to measure the grid current, plate current, and power output and
comparing those values with those obtained when using tubes known to be good.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-4. Normally, how are high-power rf tubes tested?
Klystron Tube Tests
</p><p class="paragraph">You can check low-power klystron tubes for gas, frequency of the output signal, and output power
by placing them in the equipment where they are to be used. You measure the beam current, output</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">frequency, and output power with the transmitter’s built-in test equipment. You can check the output of
klystrons used as receiver local oscillators by measuring the current in the crystal mixer unit.
</p><p class="paragraph">Klystron tubes that remain inoperative for more than 6 months may become gassy. This condition
occurs in klystrons installed in stored or spare equipment as well as in klystrons stored as stock supplies.
Operation of a gassy klystron at its rated voltages will ionize the gas molecules and may cause excessive
beam current to flow. This excessive beam current may shorten the life of the klystron or produce
immediate failure. You can detect gas in a klystron tube by setting the applied reflector voltage to zero
and slowly increasing the beam voltage while observing a meter that indicates the beam current -
excessive beam current for a specific value of voltage indicates that the tube is gassy.
</p><p class="paragraph">A gassy klystron tube can usually be restored to serviceable condition if you temporarily operate it at
reduced beam voltage. Eight hours or more of reduced voltage operation may be required for klystrons
that have been inoperative for periods in excess of 6 months.
</p><p class="paragraph">The beam current is also an indication of the power output of the klystron. As klystrons age they
normally draw less beam current; when this current decreases to a minimum value for a specific beam
voltage, the tube must be replaced. You can usually determine the power output of transmitter klystrons
by measuring the transmitter power output during equipment performance checks.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-5. What should you do if a klystron becomes gassy?
Traveling-Wave Tube
</p><p class="paragraph">You can usually test a traveling-wave tube (twt) in the equipment in which it is used. When the twt is
installed, you can usually measure the collector current and voltage and check the power output for
various inputs. Any deviation greater than 10% from normal specifications may be considered to be an
indication of a defective tube. Most amplifiers are supplied with built-in panel meters and selector
switches so that the cathode, anode, helix, focus, and collector currents may be measured. Thus,
continuous monitoring of amplifier operation and tube evaluation is possible. Adjustments usually are
provided for you to set the helix, grid bias, and collector voltages for optimum operation. If variation of
these controls will not produce normal currents and if all voltages are normal, you should consider the
tube to be defective and replace it with a new tube or one known to be in good operating condition. To
avoid needless replacement of tubes, however, you should make an additional check by measuring the
input power and output power and determining the tube gain. If, with normal operating conditions, the
gain level drops below the minimum indicated value in the equipment technical manual, the tube is
defective.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-6. When used as an amplifier, what is the best indication that a twt is operating properly?
In the absence of special field-test sets, you may construct a laboratory test mock-up similar to that
</p><p class="paragraph">shown in figure 2-3. Because of the variations in power and gain between tubes and the large frequency
ranges offered, we can illustrate only a general type of equipment. The equipment you select must have
the proper range, impedance, and attenuation to make the test for a specific type of twt. To make gain
measurements, you turn the switch shown in figure 2-3 to position 1 and set the precision attenuator to
provide a convenient level of detector output. Then turn the switch to position 2 and insert attenuation
until the detector output level is identical to that obtained without the twt in the circuit. The gain of the
traveling-wave tube is equal to the amount of added attenuation.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When you use the twt as an oscillator, failure of the tube to break into oscillations when all other
conditions are normal usually indicates a defective tube. In the case of a tube used as a receiving
amplifier, an increase of noise with a normal or reduced output can indicate that the tube is failing but is
still usable. All the general rules applying to klystron tubes mentioned previously are also applicable to
the twt.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Magnetron Tube Tests
</h3><p class="paragraph">You test a magnetron tube while it is in the transmitter equipment in which it is to be used. When
you install the magnetron in the transmitter, the condition of the tube can be determined by the normal
plate-current measurement and the power, frequency spectrum, and standing-wave-ratio tests of the
output signal. An unusual value for any of these measurements may indicate a defective tube.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Crossed-Field Amplifier
</h3><p class="paragraph">You usually test a crossed-field amplifier (cfa) tube while it is in the equipment in which it is used.
Like the klystron, if you do not operate the cfa for more than a few months, the tube may become gassy.
If a cfa tube is suspected of being gassy, we recommend that you consult the technical manual for the
particular piece of equipment in which the crossed-field amplifier is used.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TESTING-SEMICONDUCTORS-2-8-">TESTING SEMICONDUCTORS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Unlike vacuum tubes, transistors are very rugged in that they can tolerate vibration and a rather large
degree of shock. Under normal operating conditions, they will provide dependable operation for a long
period of time. However, transistors are subject to failure when they are subjected to relatively minor
overloads. Crystal detectors are also subject to failure or deterioration when subjected to electrical
overloads and will deteriorate from a long period of normal use. To determine the condition of
semiconductors, you can use various test methods. In many cases you may substitute a transistor of
known good quality for a questionable one to determine the condition of a suspected transistor. This
method is highly accurate and sometimes efficient. However, you should avoid indiscriminate
substitution of semiconductors in critical circuits. When transistors are soldered into equipment,
substitution becomes impractical - generally, you should test these transistors while they are in their
circuits.

</p><p class="paragraph">Since certain fundamental characteristics indicate the condition of semiconductors, test equipment is
available that allows you to test these characteristics with the semiconductors in or out of their circuits.
Crystal-rectifier testers normally allow you to test only the forward-to-reverse current ratio of the crystal.
Transistor testers, however, allow you to measure several characteristics, such as the collector leakage
current (Ic), collector to base current gain ( b ), and the four-terminal network parameters. The most useful
test characteristic is determined by the type of circuit in which the transistor will be used. Thus, the
alternating-current beta measurement is preferred for ac amplifier or oscillator applications; and for
switching-circuit applications, a direct-current beta measurement may prove more useful.
</p><p class="paragraph">Many common transistors are extremely heat sensitive. Excess heat will cause the semiconductor to
either fail or give intermittent operation. You have probably experienced intermittent equipment problems
and know them to be both time consuming and frustrating. You know, for example, that if a problem is in
fact caused by heat, simply opening the equipment during the course of troubleshooting may cause the
problem to disappear. You can generally isolate the problem to the faulty printed-circuit board (pcb) by
observing the fault indications. However, to further isolate the problem to a faulty component, sometimes
you must apply a minimal amount of heat to the suspect pcb by carefully using a low wattage, heat shrink
gun; an incandescent drop light; or a similar heating device. Be careful not to overheat the pcb. Once the
fault indication reappears, you can isolate the faulty component by spraying those components suspected
as being bad with a nonconductive circuit coolant, such as Freon. If the alternate heating and cooling of a
component causes it to operate intermittently, you should replace it.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-8. Name two major disadvantages of transistors.
TRANSISTOR TESTING
</p><p class="paragraph">When trouble occurs in solid-state equipment, you should first check power supplies and perform
voltage measurements, waveform checks, signal substitution, or signal tracing. If you isolate a faulty
stage by one of these test methods, then voltage, resistance, and current measurements can be made to
locate defective parts. When you make these measurements, the voltmeter impedance must be high
enough that it exerts no appreciable effect upon the voltage being measured. Also, current from the
ohmmeter you use must not damage the transistors. If the transistors are not soldered into the equipment,
you should remove the transistors from the sockets during a resistance test. Transistors should be
removed from or reinserted into the sockets only after power has been removed from the stage; otherwise
damage by surge currents may result.
</p><p class="paragraph">Transistor circuits, other than pulse and power amplifier stages, are usually biased so that the emitter
current is from 0.5 milliampere to 3 milliamperes and the collector voltage is from 3 to 15 volts. You can
measure the emitter current by opening the emitter connector and inserting a milliammeter in series.
When you make this measurement, you should expect some change in bias because of the meter
resistance. You can often determine the collector current by measuring the voltage drop across a resistor
in the collector circuit and calculating the current. If the transistor itself is suspected, it can be tested by
one or more of the methods described below.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Resistance Test
</h3><p class="paragraph">You can use an ohmmeter to test transistors by measuring the emitter-collector, base-emitter, and
base-collector forward and reverse resistances. A back-to-forward resistance ratio on the order of 100 to 1
or greater should be obtained for the collector-to-base and emitter-to-base measurements. The forward
and reverse resistances between the emitter and collector should be nearly equal. You should make all
three measurements for each transistor you test, because experience has shown that transistors can
develop shorts between the collector and emitter and still have good forward and reverse resistances for
the other two measurements. Because of shunting resistances in transistor circuits, you will normally have</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

this test to make certain that current during the forward resistance tests does not exceed the rating of the
transistor — ohmmeter ranges requiring a current of more than 1 milliampere should not be used for
testing transistors. Many ohmmeters are designed such that on the R ·  1 range, 100 milliamperes or more
can flow through the electronic part under test. For this reason, you should use a digital multimeter. Be
sure you select a digital multimeter that produces enough voltage to properly bias the transistor junctions.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-9. When you are using an ohmmeter to test a transistor, what range settings should be avoided?
Transistor Testers
</p><p class="paragraph">Laboratory transistor test sets are used in experimental work to test all characteristics of transistors.
For maintenance and repair, however, it is not necessary to check all of the transistor parameters. A check
of two or three performance characteristics is usually sufficient to determine whether a transistor needs to
be replaced. Two of the most important parameters used for transistor testing are the transistor current
gain (beta) and the collector leakage or reverse current (Ic).
</p><p class="paragraph">The semiconductor test set (fig. 2-4) is a rugged, field type of tester designed to test transistors and
semiconductor diodes. The set measures the beta of a transistor, resistance appearing at the electrodes,
reverse current of a transistor or semiconductor diode, shorted or open conditions of a diode, forward
transconductance of a field-effect transistor, and condition of its own batteries.
</p><p class="paragraph">In order to assure that accurate and useful information is gained from the transistor tester, the
following preliminary checks of the tester should be made prior to testing any transistors.
</p><p class="paragraph">With the POLARITY switch (fig. 2-4) in the OFF position, the meter pointer should indicate exactly
zero. (When required, rotate the meter adjust screw on the front of the meter to fulfill this requirement.)
When measurements are not actually being made, the POLARITY switch must always be left in the OFF
position to prevent battery drain.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Always check the condition of the test set batteries by disconnecting the test set power cord, placing
the POLARITY switch in the PNP position and placing the FUNCTION switch first to BAT.1, then to
BAT.2. In both BAT positions the meter pointer should move so as to indicate within the red BAT range.
</p><p class="paragraph">BETA MEASUREMENTS.—If the transistor is to be tested out of the circuit, plug it into the test
jack located on the right-hand side below the meter shown in figure 2-4. If the transistor is to be tested in
the circuit, it is imperative that at least 300 ohms exist between E-B, C-B, and C-E for accurate
measurement. Initial settings of the test set controls are as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. FUNCTION switch to BETA
</p><p class="paragraph">2. POLARITY switch to PNP or NPN (dependent on type of transistor under test)
3. RANGE switch to X10
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Adjust METER ZERO for zero meter indication (transistor disconnected)
NOTE: The POLARITY switch should remain OFF while the transistor is connected to or
</p><p class="paragraph">disconnected from the test set. If you determine that the beta reading is less than 10, reset the RANGE
switch to X1 and reset the meter to zero.
</p><p class="paragraph">After connecting the yellow test lead to the emitter, the green test lead to the base, and the blue test
lead to the collector, plug the test probe (not shown) into the jack located at the lower right-hand corner of
the test set. When testing grounded equipment, unplug the 115 vac line cord and use battery operation.
The beta reading is attained by multiplying the meter reading times the RANGE switch setting. Refer to
the transistor characteristics book provided with the tester to determine if the reading is normal for the
type of transistor under test.
</p><p class="paragraph">ELECTRODE RESISTANCE MEASUREMENTS.—Connect the in-circuit probe test leads to
the transistor with the yellow lead to the emitter, the green lead to the base, and the blue lead to the
collector. Set the FUNCTION switch to the OHMS E-B position, and read the resistance between the
emitter and base electrode on the center scale of the meter.
</p><p class="paragraph">To read the resistance between the collector and base and the collector and emitter, set the
FUNCTION switch to OHMS C-B and OHMS C-E. These in-circuit electrode resistance measurements
are used to correctly interpret the in-circuit beta measurements. The accuracy of the BETA X1, X10 range
is – 15 percent only when the emitter-to-base load is equal to or greater than 300 ohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">Ic MEASUREMENTS.—Adjust the METER ZERO control for zero meter indication. Plug the
transistor to be tested into the jack or connect test leads to the device under test. Set the PNP/NPN switch
to correspond with the transistor under test. Set the FUNCTION switch to Ic and the RANGE switch to
X0.1, X1, or X10 as specified by the transistor data book for allowable leakage. Read the amount of
leakage on the bottom scale, and multiply this by the range setting figure as required.
</p><p class="paragraph">DIODE MEASUREMENTS.—Diode qualitative in-circuit measurements are attained by
connecting the green test lead to the cathode and the yellow test lead to the anode. Set the FUNCTION
switch to DIODE IN/CKT and the RANGE switch to X1. (Ensure that the meter has been properly zeroed
on this scale.) If the meter reads down scale, reverse the POLARITY switch. If the meter reads less than
midscale, the diode under test is either open or shorted. The related circuit impedance of this test is less
than 25 ohms.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">PRECAUTIONS.—Transistors, although generally more rugged mechanically than electron tubes,
are susceptible to damage by excessive heat and electrical overload. The following precautions should be
taken in servicing transistorized equipment:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Test equipment and soldering irons must be checked to make certain that there is no leakage
current from the power source. If leakage current is detected, isolation transformers must be used.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Ohmmeter ranges that require a current of more than 1 milliampere in the test circuit are not to be
used for testing transistors.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Battery eliminators should not be used to furnish power for transistor equipment because they
have poor voltage regulation and, possibly, high ripple voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">4. The heat applied to a transistor, when soldered connections are required, should be kept to a
minimum by using a low-wattage soldering iron and heat shunts (such as long-nose pliers) on the
transistor leads.
</p><p class="paragraph">5. All circuits should be checked for defects before a transistor is replaced.
</p><p class="paragraph">6. The power should be removed from the equipment before replacing a transistor or other circuit
part.
</p><p class="paragraph">7. When working on equipment with closely spaced parts, you will find that conventional test
probes are often the cause of accidental short circuits between adjacent terminals. Momentary
short circuits, which rarely cause damage to an electron tube, may ruin a transistor. To avoid
accidental shorts, a test probe can be covered with insulation for all but a very short length of the
tip.

Devices that are sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD) require special handling. You can readily
</p><p class="paragraph">identify ESD-sensitive (ESDS) devices by the symbols shown in figure 2-5. Static electricity is created
whenever two substances (solid or fluid) are rubbed together or separated. The rubbing or separating of
substances causes the transfer of electrons from one substance to the other; one substance then becomes
positively charged, and the other becomes negatively charged. When either of these charged substances
comes in contact with a grounded conductor, an electrical current flows until that substance is at the same
electrical potential as ground.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

exposed or have low impedance paths. Similarly, an ESDS device in a printed-circuit board or even in
another pcb that is electrically connected in a series can be damaged if it provides a path to ground. ESD
damage can occur during the manufacture of equipment or during the servicing of the equipment. Damage
can occur anytime devices or assemblies are handled, replaced, tested, or inserted into a connector.

protection circuitry on all input circuits; dielectrically isolated semiconductors with internal
capacitor contacts connected to external pins; and microcircuits using N + guard-ring
construction (with metalization crossing over the guard ring).

that operate at 500 MHz or higher; all discrete semiconductors that use silicon dioxide to insulate
metal paths over other active areas; MOS or CMOS devices with input diode protection on all

completely de-energized, one clip end is connected to the grounded equipment frame; the other
clip end is touched with your bare hand. Figure 2-6 shows a more refined ground strap, which

in the unit package.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 4. Minimize handling of ESDS devices and assemblies. Keep replacement devices or assemblies,
with their connector-shorting bars, clips, and so forth, intact in their electrostatic-free packages
until needed. Place removed repairable ESDS devices or assemblies, with their connector shorting
bars or clips installed, in electrostatic-free packages as soon as they are removed from the
equipment. ESDS devices or assemblies should be transported and stored only in protective
packaging.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 5. Always avoid unnecessary physical movement, such as scuffing the feet, when handling ESDS
devices or assemblies. Such movement will generate additional charges of static electricity.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 6. When removing or replacing an ESDS device or assembly in the equipment, hold the device or
assembly through the electrostatic-free wrap if possible. Otherwise, pick up the device or
assembly by its body only. DO NOT TOUCH component leads, connector pins, or any other
electrical connections or paths on boards, even though they are covered by conformal coating.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 7. Do not permit ESDS devices or assemblies to come in contact with clothing or other ungrounded
materials that could have an electrostatic charge. The charges on a nonconducting material are not
equal. A plastic storage bag may have a - 10,000 volt potential one-half inch from a +15,000 volt
potential, with many other such charges all over the bag. Placing a circuit card inside the bag
allows the charges to equalize through the pcb conductive paths and components, thereby causing
failures. Do not hand an ESDS device or assembly to another person until the device or assembly
is protectively packaged.

plastic, vinyl, synthetic textiles, polished wood, fiber glass, or similar items that could create
static charges; or, be sure to repeat the grounding action with the bare hands after contacting these
materials. These materials are prime electrostatic generators.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 10. If possible, avoid repairs that require soldering at the equipment level. Soldering irons must have
heater and tip assemblies grounded to ac electrical ground. Do not use ordinary plastic solder
suckers (special antistatic solder suckers are commercially available).
</p><p class="paragraph"> 11. Ground the leads of test equipment momentarily before you energize the test equipment and
before you probe ESDS items.

DIODE TESTING
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of the reliability of semiconductor devices, servicing techniques developed for
transistorized equipment differ from those used for electron-tube circuits. Electron tubes are usually
considered to be the circuit component most susceptible to failure and are normally the first to be tested.
Transistors, however, are capable of operating in excess of 30,000 hours at maximum ratings without
appreciable degradation. They are often soldered into equipment in the same manner as resistors and
capacitors. Substitution of a diode or transistor known to be in good condition is a simple method of
determining the quality of a questionable semiconductor device. You should use this technique only after
voltage and resistance measurements indicate that no circuit defect exists that might damage the
substituted semiconductor device. If more than one defective semiconductor is present in the equipment
section where trouble has been localized, substitution becomes cumbersome since several semiconductors
may have to be replaced before the trouble is corrected. To determine which stages failed and which
semiconductors are not defective, you must test all of the removed semiconductors. This can be
accomplished by observing whether the equipment operates correctly as each of the removed
semiconductor devices is reinserted into the equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-13. Prior to substituting a diode, what measurements should you take to determine its condition?
DIODE TESTERS
</p><p class="paragraph">Diodes, such as general-purpose germanium and silicon diodes, power silicon diodes, and
microwave silicon diodes, are most effectively tested under actual operating conditions. However,
rectifier testers are available for you to determine direct-current characteristics that provide an indication
of diode quality.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Rf Diode Test
</h3><p class="paragraph">A common type of diode test set is a combination ohmmeter-ammeter. You can make measurements
of forward resistance, back resistance, and reverse current with this equipment. You can determine the
condition of the rectifier under test by comparing its actual values with typical values obtained from test
information furnished with the test set or from the manufacturer’s data sheets. Comparing the diode’s back
and forward resistance at a specified voltage provides you with a rough indication of the rectifying
property of a diode. A typical back-to-forward resistance ratio is on the order of 10 to 1, and a forward-
resistance value of 50 to 80 ohms is common.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

smaller value is called the forward resistance, and the larger value is called the back resistance. If the ratio
of back-to-forward resistance is greater than 10 to 1, the diode should be capable of functioning as a

by some range settings of a standard multimeter. Therefore, you should use a digital multimeter when
performing this measurement.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-14. As a rule of thumb, what is an acceptable ratio of back-to-forward resistance for a diode?
SILICON-CONTROLLED RECTIFIERS (SCR)
</p><p class="paragraph">Many naval electronic equipments use silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs) for the control of power.
Like other solid-state components, SCRs are subject to failure. You can test most SCRs with a standard
ohmmeter, but you must understand just how the SCR functions.
</p><p class="paragraph">As shown in figure 2-12, the SCR is a three-element, solid-state device in which the forward
resistance can be controlled. The three active elements shown in the figure are the anode, cathode, and
gate. Although they may differ in outward appearance, all SCRs operate in the same way. The SCR acts
like a very high-resistance rectifier in both forward and reverse directions without requiring a gate signal.
However, when the correct gate signal is applied, the SCR conducts only in the forward direction, the
same as any conventional rectifier. To test an SCR, you connect an ohmmeter between the anode and
cathode, as shown in figure 2-12. Start the test at R ·  10,000 and reduce the value gradually. The SCR
under test should show a very high resistance, regardless of the ohmmeter polarity. The anode, which is
connected to the positive lead of the ohmmeter, must now be shorted to the gate. This will cause the SCR
to conduct; as a result, a low-resistance reading will be indicated on the ohmmeter. Removing the anode-
to-gate short will not stop the SCR from conducting; but removing either of the ohmmeter leads will
cause the SCR to stop conducting — the resistance reading will then return to its previous high value.
Some SCRs will not operate when you connect an ohmmeter. This is because the ohmmeter does not
supply enough current. However, most of the SCRs in Navy equipment can be tested by the ohmmeter
method. If an SCR is sensitive, the R ·  1 scale may supply too much current to the device and damage it.
Therefore, try testing it on the higher resistance scales.

of applied voltages and with either positive or negative gate triggering. Like a conventional SCR, the
Triac is an excellent solid-state device for controlling current flow. You can make the Triac conduct by
using the same method used for an SCR, but the Triac has the advantage of being able to conduct equally
well in either the forward or reverse direction.
</p><p class="paragraph">To test the Triac with an ohmmeter (R ·  1 scale), you connect the ohmmeter’s negative lead to anode
1 and the positive lead to anode 2, as shown in figure 2-13. The ohmmeter should indicate a very high
resistance. Short the gate to anode 2; then remove it. The resistance reading should drop to a low value

when working with MOSFETs because of their high degree of sensitivity to static voltages. As previously
mentioned in this chapter, the soldering iron should be grounded. A metal plate should be placed on the
workbench and grounded to the ship’s hull through a 250-kilohm to 1-megohm resistor. You should also
wear a bracelet with an attached ground strap and ground yourself to the ship’s hull through a 250-kilohm
to 1-megohm resistor. You should not allow a MOSFET to come into contact with your clothing, plastics,
or cellophane-type materials. A vacuum plunger (solder sucker) must not be used because of the high
electrostatic charges it can generate. Solder removal by wicking is recommended. It is also good practice
to wrap MOSFETs in metal foil when they are out of a circuit. To ensure MOSFET safety under test, use
a portable volt-ohm-milliammeter (vom) to make MOSFET resistance measurements. A vtvm must
never be used in testing MOSFETs. You must be aware that while you are testing a MOSFET, you are
grounded to the ship’s hull or station’s ground. Use of a vtvm would cause a definite safety hazard because
of the 115-volt, 60-hertz power input. When the resistance measurements are complete and the MOSFET

</h3><p class="paragraph">electronic components are combined into high-density modules. Integrated circuits are made up of active
and passive components, such as transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors. Because of their reduced
size, use of integrated circuits can simplify otherwise complex systems by reducing the number of
separate components and interconnections. Their use can also reduce power consumption, reduce the
overall size of the equipment, and significantly lower the overall cost of the equipment concerned. Many
types of integrated circuits are ESDS devices and should be handled accordingly.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-18. Name two advantages in using ICs.
Your IC testing approach needs to be somewhat different from that used in testing vacuum tubes and
</p><p class="paragraph">transistors. The physical construction of ICs is the prime reason for this different approach. The most
frequently used ICs are manufactured with either 14 or 16 pins, all of which may be soldered directly into
the circuit. It can be quite a job for you to unsolder all of these pins, even with the special tools designed
for this purpose. After unsoldering all of the pins, you then have the tedious job of cleaning and
straightening all of them.
</p><p class="paragraph">Although there are a few IC testers on the market, their applications are limited. Just as transistors
must be removed from the circuit to be tested, some ICs must also be removed to permit testing. When
ICs are used in conjunction with external components, the external components should first be checked
for proper operation. This is particularly important in linear applications where a change in the feedback
of a circuit can adversely affect operating characteristics of the component.
</p><p class="paragraph">Any linear (analog) IC is sensitive to its supply voltage. This is especially the case among ICs that
use bias and control voltages in addition to a supply voltage. If you suspect a linear IC of being defective,
all voltages coming to the IC must be checked against the manufacturer’s circuit diagram of the
equipment for any special notes on voltages. The manufacturer’s handbook will also give you
recommended voltages for any particular IC.
</p><p class="paragraph">When troubleshooting ICs (either digital or linear), you cannot be concerned with what is going on
inside the IC. You cannot take measurements or conduct repairs inside the IC. You should, therefore,
consider the IC as a black box that performs a certain function. You can check the IC, however, to see
that it can perform its design functions. After you check static voltages and external components
associated with the IC, you can check it for dynamic operation. If it is intended to function as an
amplifier, then you can measure and evaluate its input and output. If it is to function as a logic gate or
combination of gates, it is relatively easy for you to determine what inputs are required to achieve a
desired high or low output. Examples of different types of ICs are provided in figure 2-23.

</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-19. Why should you consider an IC as a black box?
Digital ICs are relatively easy for you to troubleshoot and test because of the limited numbers of
</p><p class="paragraph">input/output combinations involved. When using positive logic, the logic state of the inputs and outputs of
a digital IC can only be represented as either a high (also referred to as a 1 state) or as a low (also referred
to as a 0 state). In most digital circuitry, a high is a steady 5-vdc level, and a low is a 0-vdc level. You can
readily determine the logic state of an IC by using high-input-impedence measuring devices, such as an
oscilloscope. Because of the increased use of ICs in recent years, numerous pieces of test equipment have
been designed specifically for testing ICs. They are described in the following paragraphs.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-20. What are the two logic states of an IC?
LOGIC CLIPS
</p><p class="paragraph">Logic clips, as shown in figure 2-24, are spring-loaded devices that are designed to clip onto a dual-
in-line package IC while the IC is mounted in its circuit. It is a simple device that usually has 16 light
emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted at the top of the clips. The LEDs correspond to the individual pins of the
IC, and any lit LED represents a high logic state. An unlit LED represents a low logic state. Logic clips
require no external power connections, and they are small and lightweight. Their ability to simultaneously
monitor the input and output of an IC is very helpful when you are troubleshooting a logic circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-21. A lighted LED on a logic clip represents what logic level?
LOGIC COMPARATORS
</p><p class="paragraph">The logic comparator, as shown in figure 2-25, is designed to detect faulty, in-circuit-DIP ICs by
comparing them with ICs that are known to be good (reference ICs). The reference IC is mounted on a
small printed-circuit board and inserted into the logic comparator. You then attach the logic comparator to
the IC under test by a test lead, which is connected to a spring-loaded device similar in appearance to a
logic clip. The logic comparator is designed to detect differences in logic states of the reference IC and
the IC being tested. If any difference in logic states does exist on any pin, an LED corresponding to the
pin in question will be lit on the logic comparator. The logic comparator is powered by the IC under test.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-22. What does a lighted LED indicate on a logic comparator?
LOGIC PROBES
</p><p class="paragraph">Logic probes, as shown in figure 2-26, are extremely simple and useful devices that are designed to
help you detect the logic state of an IC. Logic probes can show you immediately whether a specific point
in the circuit is low, high, open, or pulsing. A high is indicated when the light at the end of the probe is
lit and a low is indicated when the light is extinguished. Some probes have a feature that detects and
displays high-speed transient pulses as small as 5 nanoseconds wide. These probes are usually connected
directly to the power supply of the device being tested, although a few also have internal batteries. Since
most IC failures show up as a point in the circuit stuck either at a high or low level, these probes provide
a quick, inexpensive way for you to locate the fault. They can also display that single, short-duration
pulse that is so hard to catch on an oscilloscope. The ideal logic probe will have the following
characteristics:

LOGIC PULSERS
</p><p class="paragraph">Another extremely useful device for troubleshooting logic circuits is the logic pulser. It is similar in
shape to the logic probe and is designed to inject a logic pulse into the circuit under test. Logic pursers are
generally used in conjunction with a logic clip or a logic probe to help you trace the pulse through the
circuit under test or verify the proper operation of an IC. Some logic pursers have a feature that allows a
single pulse injection or a train of pulses. Logic pursers are usually powered by an external dc power
supply but may, in some cases, be connected directly to the power supply of the device under test. View

</h2><p class="paragraph">A relatively new device on the test equipment scene is the logic analyzer. A logic analyzer provides
various functions that can assist you in maintenance, testing, and troubleshooting of equipment using
digital circuitry. From your standpoint, they are extremely useful in performing timing analysis. Most
logic analyzers have crt displays that can monitor up to 32 timing signals at the same time. A large
percentage of today’s digital equipment is designed with the logic analyzer in mind and have built-in
status or bus lines for your convenience in monitoring multiple signals at the same time. When
monitoring a bus line, you can readily determine, through visual displays, such things as the presence of
master clock signals or sequential timing events.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BATTERY-MEASUREMENTS-2-32-">BATTERY MEASUREMENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">As a technician, you are primarily concerned with the uses of batteries; however, checking or testing
of storage and dry cell batteries is an important part of your maintenance program. Proper preventive
maintenance of batteries can significantly extend the useful life of a battery.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-STORAGE-BATTERIES-2-32-">STORAGE BATTERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">When you check a lead-acid type of storage battery for its condition of charge or discharge, you take
a specific gravity reading of the electrolyte by using a hydrometer. A specific gravity reading between
1.275 and 1.300 indicates a full-charge condition and assures you that the battery is in good condition. A
hydrometer reading of approximately 1.175 indicates a normal discharge condition, and a reading of
approximately 1.250 indicates that the battery is half-discharged. Since the acids used in various batteries
do not always have the same specific gravity and since electrode composition may differ, the hydrometer
reading you obtain at the charged and discharged conditions will vary with the type of electrolyte and
battery composition. A general rule for you to follow is not to discharge a battery more than 100 points
(.100 specific gravity) before recharging.
</p><p class="paragraph">Although readings of specific gravity are a reliable measure of the condition of a storage battery,
cells that indicate normal may prove useless under load. This is usually caused by a high internal
resistance. A load-voltage check of the cells with the use of a cell tester indicates the actual voltage</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Use extreme caution whenever testing or working around lead-acid storage batteries. OPNAVINST
5100.23B emphatically states that you must wear eye protection devices at all times and that emergency
eyewash facilities must be immediately adjacent to, or within 10 feet of, any eye-hazard area. Smoking
and spark-producing tools or devices are also prohibited in enclosed spaces that contain lead-acid storage
batteries. When charging, these batteries produce sufficient quantities of hydrogen to produce large
explosions. Lead-acid storage batteries should only be charged in well-ventilated spaces.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-24. Emergency eyewash facilities must be located within what minimum number of feet of an eye-
hazard area?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DRY-BATTERIES-2-33-">DRY BATTERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">You must periodically check dry cell batteries that are used for test instruments and portable or field
equipments for loss of power. For actual voltages of dry batteries, you should measure with a battery
tester for a minimum acceptable voltage before installation. The TS-183/U series of battery testers
incorporate a multiple-range voltmeter, battery-loading resistors, multiplier resistors, and a jack-switching
arrangement that connects the load resistors across the voltmeter for a total of 32 different voltmeter-load
resistor combinations. This type of tester permits you to complete a rapid and accurate measurement of
battery potentials under load conditions, ranging in voltages from 1.5 to 180 volts. A data chart supplied
with the battery tester provides information regarding the jack to be used and minimum acceptable
voltages of various batteries used in Navy equipments.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The storage life of a mercury cell varies but is generally classified as long. The working life of the
cell is extremely long relative to other types of batteries; and it maintains its full rated voltage (1.34 volts)
until just before it is ready to expire, at which point its voltage will drop off sharply. Recharging of
mercury cells is possible, but is not recommended because the recharging cycle can vary from one cell to
another; and, after being recharged, their operating lifetime is uncertain.
</p><p class="paragraph">NICKEL-CADMIUM BATTERIES (NICAD)
Nickel-cadmium batteries have very high efficiency. They can be recharged hundreds of times; given
</p><p class="paragraph">the proper conditions, they may even be recharged thousands of times. They can be stored for a number of
years with no significant loss of performance. After just a few charge and discharge cycles, NICAD cells
can be recharged to the point that they are just as good as new batteries. Since they are sealed, they are
maintenance free and can be installed in any position. There are two types of nickel-cadmium batteries —
vented and nonvented. This description deals with the nonvented exclusively because a vented NICAD
would have extremely limited application in a shipboard environment.
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltage at the terminals of a NICAD will normally be between 1.25 and 1.30 volts in an open-
circuit condition. This value will vary, of course, depending on the state of charge. If the charge has
dropped to a low of 1.1 volts, the NICAD should be regarded as being completely discharged and should
not be permitted to be discharged further. The majority of small NICADs are rated in milliampere hours;
the large ones are rated in ampere hours. The small NICAD is the one the technician will almost always
be concerned with.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-26. At what voltage is a NICAD battery considered to be fully discharged?
As a general rule, if the charging current is held to 10% of the milliampere-hour rating for the
</p><p class="paragraph">NICAD and the time of charge is held at 150% of the time required to establish its full milliampere-hour
rating, you will encounter no difficulty in maintaining NICADs at their maximum charge. For example,
you should charge a battery rated at 300 milliampere hours for 15 hours at 30 milliamperes. You can
leave the battery on extended charge for years, provided the charge rate is lowered to less than 10% of the
NICAD's milliampere rating.
</p><p class="paragraph">You should never place a NICAD in your pocket, because metal objects (such as keys) can short the
cell and cause extreme heat. Never dispose of a NICAD by fire, because it can explode. Never solder a
connection directly to the cell, because the heat of an iron can damage it. Never overcharge a NICAD
cell, because an accumulation of gases within its case can destroy it.
</p><p class="paragraph">NICADs are also subject to a phenomenon commonly referred to as cell memory. If a NICAD is
consistently discharged to a minor extent (for example, 30 minutes per day) and then recharged after each
use, the useful capacity of the cell will eventually be reduced to that level. To keep this from happening,
you should fully discharge (1.1 volts) NICADs on a regular basis. In fact, some maintenance requirement
cards and calibration laboratory procedures require this periodic full discharge of equipment containing
NICADs.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fixed rf attenuators (shown in fig. 2-28), such as the ones commonly found in power-measuring sets,
are designed to provide a fixed-signal attenuation over a specific frequency range. Frequency ranges can
be in excess of 30 gigahertz, and attenuation factors are typically in 1-, 3-, 6-, and 10-dB steps. Fixed
attenuators can be connected in series to provide you with the desired attenuation. Most fixed rf
attenuators are designed to handle only small amounts of rf power and are extremely susceptible to
damage because of overloading. To test a fixed rf attenuator, you can either substitute it with a known
good attenuator or perform basic measurements on the attenuator itself. With the rf substitution method,
you connect an rf signal generator to a power meter and establish a suitable reference point on the meter
by adjusting the power output of the signal generator. Once you establish the reference point, insert the rf
attenuator between the signal generator and the power meter. You then determine the attenuation by
noting the difference between the power meter reading and the initial reference point.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-27. What is the most common method of testing a fixed rf attenuator?
DECADE RESISTORS
</p><p class="paragraph">Decade resistors (also referred to as decade boxes) typically are precision devices. Depending on the
make and model of the decade resistor, it may be capable of providing you with a selection of resistors
ranging in value from a small fraction of an ohm to hundreds of megohms. Decade resistors are
commonly used in calibration laboratories and in engineering design applications. Like the fixed rf
attenuator, most decade resistors are capable of handling only small amounts of current. They are very
limited in respect to frequency capabilities and are commonly used in dc-circuit applications. You may
encounter specific equipment that requires the use of a decade resistor in performing your maintenance
tests or alignments. To test a decade resistor, you can connect a standard multimeter or digital multimeter
directly across its resistance terminals and read its resistance on the meter. This test will only indicate
gross errors in the decade resistor such as an open or a badly damaged resistor. If you are performing a
precision measurement or an alignment using a decade resistor and have any doubt as to its accuracy, you
should submit it to your servicing calibration laboratory. Figure 2-29 shows a typical decade resistor.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Fiber optics are a relatively new type of transmission media. Figure 2-31 depicts a typical fiber-optic
cable design. The core of the fiber-optic cable is the optical transmission path, which carries data from the
optical transmitter to the optical receiver. The core is usually made of plastic, glass, or plastic-clad silica
(PCS). Glass-core fibers are usually smaller in diameter than plastic or PCS cores. The major
disadvantages of glass cores are that they have high attenuation (25 dB/km), require precision tools and
connectors, and are extremely susceptible to mechanical damage. Plastic cores are typically more rugged
than other types of cores, but their attenuation is high (35 dB/km). PCS cores are fairly rugged and have a
relatively low attenuation (10 dB/km). A fiber-optic cable may consist of one fiber, multiples of single-
optical fibers, or bundles of optical fibers. Fiber-optic cables are well suited for the transmission of high-
speed data over relatively short distances. They are virtually immune to crosstalk or interference through
inductance. (Interference is a characteristic of metallic cables.)
</p><p class="paragraph">Testing techniques and the principles of measurement for fiber-optic and conventional cable are
similar. For example, if both ends of the cable are exposed and can be used for testing, relatively
unsophisticated equipment can be used to measure cable parameters, such as continuity and attenuation.
This includes equipment such as optical multimeters and optical power meters (OPM). If only one cable
end is available, then more sophisticated equipment such as an optical time-domain reflectometer
(OTDR), is used. The following section lists and defines some common optical test equipment.

transmission loss, and connector splice loss. For cable transmission measurements, transmission through a
short length of cable is compared with transmission through a known longer length.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OPTICAL-OHMMETER-2-38-">OPTICAL OHMMETER
</h2><p class="paragraph">The optical ohmmeter measures the input versus the output of light in an optical fiber. It displays
attenuation losses based on a comparison of known and unknown cable signals. It can be used in
manufacturing, connecting, and installing cable. It is as simple to use as a digital voltmeter.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-OPTICAL-POWER-METER-2-38-">OPTICAL POWER METER
</h2><p class="paragraph">The optical power meter measures current by converting light power from plug-in units, such as light
emitting diodes, into electrical current. In some models, the readout is in power units, watts. In other
models, the readout is in absolute power levels and attenuation. Some units operate with a variety of
power sensors for conventional coaxial and waveguide systems and fiber-optic systems.
</p><h3 class="subsection">RADIOMETER/PHOTOMETER
</h3><p class="paragraph">The radiometer/photometer measures light power in watts from dc to unlimited ac response. It uses
plug-in sensor heads and, for low-light displays, it uses spectrometers and fiber-optic measurements.
</p><h3 class="subsection">AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT
Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is test equipment designed to evaluate the operational
</h3><p class="paragraph">performance of a piece of equipment or printed circuit board (pcb). ATE assists you in troubleshooting a
fault to the defective component. Basically, ATEs are state-of-the-art, computer devices in which
software programs are specifically tailored to meet the requirements of the device being tested.

</p><p class="paragraph">The AN/USM-465 is part of the Support and Test Equipment Engineering Program (STEEP). It
provides on-site screen testing and fault isolation of digital pcb’s and modules. The psp is presently
available on most ships and shore intermediate maintenance activities (SIMA) with Mini/Micro
maintenance stations (2M). Psp’s come with maintenance-assist modules (spare parts kit) and diagnostic
kits.
</p><p class="paragraph">The psp is easy to use. You have a choice of three pcb connectors (located on the top panel of the
test set) into which you insert the pcb being tested. The software program, which is provided on magnetic
tape cartridges, is then loaded into the test set. The test set automatically tests the pcb by applying input
signals to the appropriate pins while monitoring the output signal for a correct indication. An LED display
will give you a pass or fail indication. If a pcb fails the operational test, the psp tells you (via LED
display) what troubleshooting steps must be taken. The psp uses a guided probe fault isolation technique
that tells you what test points to check on the faulty pcb. The software program guides you from the faulty
output backwards toward the input until the fault is located. The probe is a standard 10 megohm, 10 to 1
oscilloscope probe. The guided probe circuitry and software is also unique because it is capable of
locating faults within feedback loops and can sense when you have placed the probe at an incorrect test
point.
</p><p class="paragraph">An interesting advantage is that if the psp itself fails, the faulty board inside the psp can be identified
by the test set’s own capability. After you replace the faulty pcb with a good one from the spare parts kit,
you can use the psp to identify the faulty component on its own pcb.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Testing Components by Comparison
</h3><p class="paragraph">Testing components by comparison is the most preferred method for troubleshooting. The ALT
(alternate) mode setup is the most commonly used mode for this method. This mode allows the technician
to compare a known good component to a suspect component. This is accomplished by connecting
channel A to a known good device, channel B to the device under test, and a common test lead to COM as
illustrated in figure 2-34. Select the ALT button, and the 2000 will alternately display the signature of the
known good device and the device under test. By examining the signature differences, you can detect a
defective component. Figure 2-35 is a typical example of the CRT display on the 2000 while testing the
base to emitter on a good transistor. Figure 2-36 illustrates a defective transistor under the same test setup.
Note that in the low range, the transistor appears to be good. Sometimes component defects are more
obvious in one range than another, so is a suspect device appears normal for one range, try the other
ranges.

</h3><p class="paragraph">When you are testing individual components in a circuit, a parallel resistor or diode of similar value

</p><p class="paragraph">You should be aware that devices made by different manufacturers may appear to have slightly
different signatures. This is normal, especially with digital integrated circuits, and does not necessarily
indicate a failed device. When this occurs, the best way to verify this is to compare the outputs of the
device under test with the equipment specifications to ensure the signals are adequate for proper
equipment operation.

a component is or is not functioning properly. This chapter will cover techniques used in measurements of 
specific impedance, frequency, and power. These measurements are extremely important to you in 
evaluating the performance of a piece of electronic equipment. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-IMPEDANCE-MEASUREMENTS-3-1-">IMPEDANCE MEASUREMENTS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Impedance measurements are often used during routine test procedures. Impedance-measuring 
equipment, such as impedance bridges, are mainly used in determining the capacitance and inductance of 
component parts. However, the values of combined circuit constants also may be obtained and used in 
direct calculations of impedance. An impedance measurement effectively totals the inductive and 
capacitive reactance together with the resistance in a circuit. In addition, impedance measurements are 
useful in testing and analyzing antenna and transmission line performance and for determining the figure 
of merit (Q) of electrical parts and resonant circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q meters are impedance-measuring instruments that determine the ratio of reactance to resistance of 
capacitors or inductors and resistors. Details of Q meters and impedance bridges as well as a number of 
other methods of measuring circuit impedance are described in the following paragraphs. Also discussed 
are methods of measuring the impedance of antennas and transmission lines. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BRIDGE-METHODS-3-1-">BRIDGE METHODS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Bridges are among the most accurate types of measuring devices used in the measurement of 
impedance. In addition, bridges are also used to measure dc resistance, capacitance, and inductance. 
Certain types of bridges are more suitable for measuring a specific characteristic, such as capacitance or 
inductance. Basic schematics for the various bridge circuits are shown in figure 3-1. The bridge circuits 
shown are similar in that they usually contain two branches in the measuring circuit, two branches in the 
comparing circuit, a detector circuit, and a power circuit, as shown in figure 3-2. The bridge shown in 
figure 3-2 is actually the dc Wheatstone bridge; however, the general principles of circuit operation for ac 
remain the same. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The comparing circuit contains branches A and B and has provisions for changing the ratios of the 
branches with respect to each other, which enables various measuring ranges to be obtained. Comparison 
of figures 3-1 and 3-2 shows that either or both branches of the comparing circuit do not necessarily 
contain resistors alone. Branch B of the Hay bridge, containing CB and RB in series connection, provides a 
striking contrast with the parallel connection of CB and RB of the Maxwell bridge. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The measuring circuit in figure 3-2 also contains two branches. The resistance, capacitance, or 
inductance to be measured is connected to branch X of the bridge-measuring circuit. The subscript X is 
also used in figure 3-1 to designate the circuit parameters involved in computing the values of various 
electronic parts. Branch S contains the variable control used to bring the bridge into a balanced condition. 
A potentiometer is used for this purpose in most bridge equipment, because it offers a wide range of 
smoothly variable current changes within the measuring circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The third arm of the bridge is the detector circuit. The detector circuit may use a galvanometer for 
sensitive measurements that require high accuracy. In the case of bridges using ac as the power source, 
the galvanometer must be adapted for use in an ac circuit. In many practical bridge circuits using ac to 
operate the bridge, an electron-ray indicating tube is used to indicate the balanced condition by opening 
and closing the shadow area of the tube. Headsets are also used for audible balance detection, but this 
method reduces the accuracy obtainable with the bridge. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Switches are used in bridge circuits to control the application of operating power to the bridge and to 
complete the detector circuit. Frequently, the two switching functions are combined into a single key, 
called a bridge key, so that the operating power is applied to the bridge prior to the detector circuit. This 
sequence reduces the effects of inductance and capacitance during the process of measurement. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The most unfavorable condition for making a measurement occurs when the resistance, capacitance, 
or inductance to be measured is completely unknown. In these cases, the galvanometer cannot be 
protected by setting the bridge arms for approximate balance. To reduce the possibility of damage to the 
galvanometer, you should use an adjustable shunt circuit across the meter terminals. As the bridge is 
brought closer to the balanced condition, the resistance of the shunt can be increased; when the bridge is 
in balance, the meter shunt can be removed to obtain maximum detector sensitivity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Bridges designed specifically for capacitance measurements provide a dc source of potential for 
electrolytic capacitors. The electrolytic capacitors often require the application of dc polarizing voltages 
in order for them to exhibit the same capacitance values and dissipation factors that would be obtained in 
actual circuit operation. The dc power supply and meter circuits used for this purpose are connected so 
that there is no interference with the normal operation of the capacitance-measuring bridge circuit. The 
dissipation factor of the capacitor may be obtained while the capacitor is polarized. In figure 3-2, the 
signal voltage in the A and B branches of the bridge will be divided in proportion to the resistance ratios 
of its component members, RA and RB, for the range of values selected. The same signal voltage is 
impressed across the branches S and X of the bridge. The variable control, RS, is rotated to change the 
current flowing through the S and X branches of the bridge. When the voltage drop across branch S is 
equal to the voltage drop across branch A, the voltage drop across branch X is equal to the voltage drop 
across branch B. At this time the potentials across the detector circuit are the same, resulting in no current 
flow through the detector circuit and an indication of zero-current flow. The bridge is balanced at these 
settings of its operating controls, and they cannot be placed at any other setting and still maintain this 
balanced condition. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ability of the bridge circuit to detect a balanced condition is not impaired by the length or the 
leads connecting the bridge to the electronic part to be measured. However, the accuracy of the

affecting accuracy of a measurement are because of the connecting leads. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Stray wiring capacitance and inductance, called residuals, that exist between the branches of the 
bridge also cause errors. The resistance-ratio bridge, for example, is redrawn in figure 3-3 to show the 
interfering residuals that must be eliminated or taken into consideration. Fortunately, these residuals can 
be reduced to negligible proportions by shielding and grounding. A method of shielding and grounding a 
bridge circuit to reduce the effects of interfering residuals is through the use of a Wagner ground, as 
shown in figure 3-4. Observe that with switch S in position Y, the balanced condition can be obtained by 
adjusting Z1 and Z2. With switch S in position X, the normal method of balancing the bridge applies. You 
should be able to reach a point where there is no deflection of the meter movement for either switch 
position (X or Y) by alternately adjusting Z1 and Z2 when the switch is at position Y and by adjusting RS 
when the switch is at position X. Under these conditions, point 1 is at ground potential; and the residuals 
at points 2, 3, and 4 are effectively eliminated from the bridge. The main disadvantage of the Wagner 
ground is that two balances must be made for each measurement. One is to balance the bridge, and the 
other is to balance the Wagner ground. Both adjustments are interacting because RA and RB are common 
to both switch positions X and Y.

</p><p class="paragraph">Many bridge instruments provide terminals for external excitation potentials; however, do not use a 
voltage in excess of that needed to obtain reliable indicator deflection because the resistivity of electronic 
parts varies with heat, which is a function of the power applied. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-1. What conditions must be met in order to balance a bridge circuit? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-2. When you are measuring a component using a bridge, what is the most common cause of 
inaccurate measurements? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Wheatstone Bridge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The Wheatstone bridge, shown in figure 3-1, is often used to measure resistance. These instruments 
are usually portable because they require only a small, dc source to power the bridge, which is easily 
obtained from flashlight batteries. In those cases where an external supply voltage is desirable for the 
operation of the bridge, use the minimum voltage that will give a reliable indication by the galvanometer. 
Increasing the supply voltage any further results in uncompensated thermal variations and decreased 
bridge accuracy. If greater bridge sensitivity is needed, use a galvanometer with greater sensitivity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A number of other considerations are involved in the choice of a galvanometer. For example, the 
galvanometer should not be subjected to false or erratic indications because of external magnetic fields. 
This requirement dictates the choice of a shielded meter mechanism. It is also desirable to use a critically 
dampened meter movement to ensure decisive movement of the meter pointer during conditions of bridge 
unbalance. Thermal agitation sometimes produces voltages that interfere with the balancing of the bridge. 
For this reason, the Wheatstone bridge usually includes a polarity-reversing switch in the detector circuit. 
When a measurement is required, note the reading for both positive and negative indications, and figure 
the average of both readings. With the exception of inaccuracies introduced by thermal variations (caused 
by excessive supply voltages), the accuracy of the Wheatstone bridge is, otherwise, independent of the 
value of supply voltages. The units used in calibrating the galvanometer are unimportant to the accuracy 
of the bridge, since a 0 indication is desired at the balanced condition. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Resistance values ranging from 1 ohm to 1 megohm can be measured with an accuracy of 
approximately 0.1%. However, difficulties are encountered when very high and very low resistances are 
measured. Resistances less than 1 ohm are difficult to measure accurately because of uncertainty arising 
from the contact resistance present between the resistor to be measured and the binding posts of the 
bridge. Measurement of resistances greater than 1 megohm becomes difficult because of two factors: (1) 
The ratio of standard resistances RA and RB involve a ratio on the order of 1,000 to 1, and (2) the voltage 
applied to the bridge must be substantially increased to obtain definite galvanometer action. The result is 
that an increase in the supply voltage increases the power dissipation (heat) of the bridge resistors. The 
change in resistance RB, because of the heat, is sufficient to produce an appreciable error. A Kelvin bridge 
is recommended for measuring resistances lower than 1 ohm. An electronic multimeter is recommended 
for the indicating device in bridges used for the measurement of very high resistances. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the most elementary precautions concerning the use of a bridge, when measuring low 
resistance, is to tighten the binding posts securely so that the contact resistance between the binding posts 
and the resistance to be measured is minimum. Leakage paths between the resistor leads along the outside 
surface of the resistor body must be avoided when resistances greater than 0.1 megohm are measured. 
Search for defective solder joints or broken strands in stranded wire leads; these defects can cause erratic 
galvanometer indications. In those cases where wire leads must be used to reach from the resistance under 
test to the bridge terminals, measure the ohmic value of those leads prior to further measurements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-3. How does the supply voltage affect the accuracy of Wheatstone bridge measurements? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Kelvin Bridge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">It is often necessary to make rapid measurements of low resistances, such as samples of wire or low 
values of meter shunt resistors. A frequently used instrument that is capable of good precision is the 
Kelvin bridge, shown in figure 3-1. Note the similarity between this and the Wheatstone bridge. Two 
additional resistances, R1 and R2, are connected in series and shunted across resistance R, which is the 
circuit resistance existing between the standard and unknown resistances, RS and R X, respectively. In 
performing the adjustment for balance, you must make the ratio of R1 to R2 equal to the ratio of RA to R 
B. When this is done, the unknown resistance can be computed in the same manner as that for the 
Wheatstone bridge, because resistance R is effectively eliminated. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In using a Kelvin bridge, you must follow precautions similar to those given for the Wheatstone 
bridge. A rheostat is usually placed in series with the battery so that bridge current can be conveniently 
limited to the maximum current allowable. This value of current, which affects the sensitivity of the 
bridge, is determined by the largest amount of heat that can be sustained by the bridge resistances without 
causing a change in their values. All connections must be firm and electrically perfect so that contact 
resistances are held to a minimum. The use of point and knife-edge clamps is recommended. 
Commercially manufactured Kelvin bridges have accuracies of approximately 2% for resistance ranges 
from 0.001 ohm to 25 ohms. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-4. Kelvin bridges are well suited for what type of measurements? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Resistance-Ratio Bridge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The resistance-ratio bridge, shown in figure 3-1, may be used to measure capacitance, inductance, or 
resistance so long as the electronic part to be measured is compared with a similar standard. The 
measurement of the value of a capacitor must be made in terms of another capacitor of known 
characteristics, termed the STANDARD CAPACITOR. The same requirement is necessary for an 
inductance measurement. The standard of comparison is designated as XX, and the losses of the standard 
are represented as R X. If you experience difficulty in obtaining a balanced bridge condition, insert </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the Q of the unknown capacitor or inductor in branch X is higher than the comparable Q of the standard in 
branch S. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Schering Bridge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The Schering bridge, shown in figure 3-1, is a commonly used type of bridge for the measurement of 
capacitors and dielectric losses. The Q of a capacitor is defined as the reciprocal of the dissipation factor, 
which is the ratio of the capacitor's dielectric constant to its conductivity at a given frequency. 
Accordingly, capacitor Q is determined by the frequency used to conduct the measurement and the value 
of the capacitor, CB, required to obtain bridge balance. The accuracy of this type of bridge is excellent, 
about 2% for dissipation factors ranging from 0.00002 to 0.6. Typical accuracies for capacitive reactances 
in the range of 100 picofarads to 1 microfarad are 0.2%. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Hay Bridge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The Hay bridge, shown in figure 3-1, is used for the measurement of inductance and the Q of the 
inductor. It is interesting to note that this type of bridge measures inductance by comparing it with a 
standard capacitor of known characteristics. This arrangement provides the advantage of a wide 
measurement range with the minimum use of electronic parts as comparison standards. A typical range of 
values that can be measured with the Hay bridge is from 1 microhenry to 100 henries. The accuracy of the 
measurements made with this bridge is about 2%. The frequency used in conducting the inductance 
measurement must be taken into account because of the series reactance of capacitor CB. The loss factor 
of the inductor under test is balanced in terms of the Q of the inductor. The Hay bridge, then, is used for 
measurement of inductances having a Q greater than 10. For instance, a Q of 10 gives a calibration error 
of 1%, whereas a Q of 30 gives a calibration error of 0.1%. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-5. When you are testing an inductor with a Hay bridge, the characteristics of the inductor are 
compared with what type of device? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Maxwell Bridge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The Maxwell bridge, shown in figure 3-1, is used for the measurement of inductance and inductive  
Q. This bridge is similar to the Hay bridge because it also measures inductance by comparison with a 
standard capacitor of known characteristics. Notice, in particular, that capacitor C B is connected in 
parallel with resistor R B. In connection with this difference, the requirement of an accurately known 
frequency is removed. This bridge circuit is employed for measuring the inductance of inductors having 
large losses; i.e., low Q. The range of this type of instrument is much greater than that of the Hay bridge; 
values ranging from 1 microhenry to 1,000 henries are measurable, with an error of only 2%.

example, the power gain of an amplifier can be expressed in dB; the power level of a sinusoidal signal

making measurements where direct indication in decibels is desired. However, remember that these are 
voltmeters, and power measurements are not meaningful unless the circuit impedance is known. When the 
dB meter is calibrated, a reference point, based on a specific power or value of voltage across a specified 
resistance, is selected to represent 0 dB. Many electronic voltmeters use a single dB scale based on 1 
milliwatt into a 600-ohm load to represent 0 dBm. Based on this reference point, various voltage readings 
could be made on the low ac-voltage scale. The +dB numbers corresponding to voltage ratios that exist 
between successive ranges and the low ac range have been computed for each range. These numbers, 
shown on the front panel of the instrument, are added algebraically to each successive range reading to 
produce the correct value for the range. The term decibel does not, in itself, indicate power. It indicates a 
ratio or comparison between two power levels that permits you to calculate the power. Often, it is more 
desirable to express performance measurements in terms of decibels using a fixed power level as a 
reference. The original standard reference level was 6 milliwatts, but to simplify calculations a standard 
reference level of 1 milliwatt has been adopted.

variation with respect to time depends not only on the signal characteristics, but also on the time interval 
over which the average is being taken. Accordingly, the speed of response of the instrument used to 
measure average power is of particular concern. The unit of measurement is the volume unit (vu), which 
is numerically equal to the number of dB above or below the reference level of 1 milliwatt into a 600-ohm 
load (provided the standard instrument was calibrated under constant-amplitude, sine-wave conditions). A 
change of one vu is the same as a change of one decibel. Therefore, the vu value obtained represents

electrodynamic wattmeter, shown in figure 3-10, uses the reaction between the magnetic fields of two 
current-carrying coils (or sets of coils), one fixed and the other movable. When the current through the 
fixed-position field winding(s) is the same as current through the load and the current through the moving 
coil is proportional to the load voltage, then the instantaneous pointer deflection is proportional to the 
instantaneous power. Since the moving pointer cannot follow the rapid variations in torque because of its 
momentum, it assumes a deflection proportional to the average power. The dynamometer-type wattmeter 
automatically compensates for the power factor error of the circuit under test. It indicates only the 
instantaneous power resulting from in-phase values of current and voltage. With out-of-phase 
relationships, a current peak through the moving coil never occurs at the same instant as the voltage peak 
across the load, resulting in less pointer deflection than when the current and voltage are in phase. The 
simple meter shown in figure 3-10 is not compensated. When the load is disconnected, this meter will still 
indicate that power is being consumed in the circuit. This difficulty can be eliminated by incorporating 
two compensating windings, mounted with the primary fixed-coil current windings, as shown in figure 3-
11. These stationary windings are used to produce a magnetic flux proportional to the current through the 
movable coil. As shown by the arrows, the currents through the primary movable coil and the 
compensating coil flow in opposite directions, producing a torque caused by the opposing magnetic 
fields. These opposing fields cancel. Hence, with the load removed from the circuit, the meter will 
indicate zero power through the load.

</p><p class="paragraph">Electrodynamic wattmeters are subject to errors arising from various factors, such as temperature 
and frequency characteristics and vibration. Heat through the control mechanism can cause the springs to 
lengthen and lose tension; as a result, deflection errors are produced. Figure 3-12 illustrates the 
mechanical equivalent of the electrodynamic wattmeter. Large currents within the circuit will also 
produce errors. Therefore, the maximum current range of electrodynamic wattmeters is normally 
restricted to about 20 amperes. When larger load currents are involved, a current transformer of suitable 
range is used in conjunction with the wattmeter. However, a current transformer cannot be used if the ac 
circuit under test contains a dc component. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltage range of wattmeters is generally limited to several hundred volts because of heat 
dissipation within the voltage circuit. However, the voltage range can be extended by using external

primarily for measuring 60-hertz line power. Unshielded electrodynamic wattmeters should not be placed 
in the vicinity of stray magnetic fields. A wattmeter has current, voltage, and power ratings; therefore, 
damage may result when any of these ratings is exceeded. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The electrodynamic wattmeter may be converted into an instrument for measuring reactive power by 
replacing the resistance normally in series with the voltage coil with a large inductance. A 90-degree 
current lag within the voltage coil provides a direct reading proportional to the reactive power in the 
circuit. Compensating networks must be used to cause the phase shift to be exactly 90º.

</p><h3 class="subsection">IRON-CORE, COMPOSITE-COIL, AND TORSION-HEAD WATTMETERS 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Iron-core wattmeters are primarily used as switchboard instruments and employ the induction 
principle. Voltage and current coils are wound around a laminated iron core shaped to produce a mutually 
perpendicular magnetic field across an air gap. Eddy currents induced in a thin metal cylinder rotating in 
this air gap interact with the magnetic field to produce a torque proportional to the instantaneous power. 
This type of construction provides the advantages of increased operating torque, larger angles of rotation, 
ruggedness, compactness, and freedom from errors caused by stray fields. It has the disadvantage of a 
very narrow frequency range. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The composite-coil wattmeter uses the upscale torque, produced by the ac power being measured, in 
opposition to the torque produced by an adjustable dc current in a set of windings intermingled or wound 
within the ac windings. Greater reading precision is obtained with this method than is possible with 
straightforward wattmeters, and errors caused by elasticity of the spring suspension carrying the moving-
coil system are avoided. The torsion-head wattmeter is used to restore the movable coil to its original 
position after deflection and to remove the mutual inductance error.

frequencies beyond the range of electrodynamometer-type instruments. A simplified electronic wattmeter 
circuit is shown in figure 3-13. The matched triodes are operated in the nonlinear portion of their 
characteristic grid-voltage, plate-current curves. The symmetrical resistive T network between the 
generator and load will provide V1 and V2 voltages proportional to, and in phase with, the load current 
and voltage, respectively. A source of ac power is connected to the load through the series resistors R1 
and R2. These two resistors are of equal value and are made small to prevent the voltage drop across them 
from reducing the load voltage appreciably. R3 is made large enough to have negligible power 
consumption. Therefore, the R3 voltage is equal to the load voltage, and the voltage across either series 
resistor is proportional to the difference in the output currents of the tubes. The average value of the 
difference could be measured by a dc meter connected to read the voltage potential between the grids of 
V1 and V2. This method is adequate only at low frequencies. As the frequency increases, the stray 
capacitances and inductances also increase. The frequency range of the electronic wattmeter can be 
extended up to 20 megahertz by using pentodes instead of triode tubes. The operating conditions in a 
pentode are adjusted so that plate current is proportional to the product of a linear function of plate 
voltage and an exponential function of grid voltage. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

absorbed by the sensing network. Output power meters, in-line wattmeters, and meters employing 
bolometers are examples of absorption power meters used by the Navy.

</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-14 shows a common output power meter used in vhf-uhf applications. It has a 0- to 150-
watt range covered in two steps: 0-50 watts and 0-150 watts. Attenuator AT1 provides a 50-ohm nominal 
resistive (dummy) load and uses metal film on glass construction. This dummy load is tapped to provide 
the proper operating voltage to the meter. Resistors R3 and R5 form a calibration network at 50 watts; R7 
and R8 form a calibration network at 150 watts. Accuracy, at approximately 20º C, is ±5% for frequencies 
between 30 MHz and 600 MHz, ±10% for frequencies between 0.6 GHz and 0.8 GHz, and ±20% for 
frequencies between 0.8 and 1.0 GHz. When radio-frequency (rf) power is applied to AT1, this attenuator 
minimizes the effects of power factors generated by any reactive components. The rf energy is then 
detected and filtered by CR1 and C1, respectively. The resultant dc voltage, which is proportional to the 
input power, is applied to a sensitive microammeter via one of the calibration networks. This meter has a 
scale provided with two ranges: 0-50 watts and 0-150 watts. To protect the meter, you should always try 
the higher range first. If the value proves to be under 50 watts, a shift to the lower scale would provide 
improved accuracy. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Q-13. What is the advantage of using in-line wattmeters over output power meters? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Bolometer 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A bolometer features a specially constructed element of temperature-sensitive material. The active 
material is a semiconductor bead supported between two pigtail leads. When rf power is applied to a 
bolometer element, the power absorption by the element heats the element and causes a change in its 
electrical resistance. Thus, a bolometer can be used in a bridge circuit so that small resistance changes can 
be easily detected and power measurement can be accomplished by the substitution method (that is, 
substitution of dc or low-frequency power to produce an equivalent heating effect). A D'Arsonval meter 
movement is usually employed as the null indicator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">According to one principle of measurement (the principle used in the balanced bridge), the bridge is 
initially balanced with low-frequency bias power. Rf power is then applied to the bolometer and the bias 
power is gradually removed until the bridge is again balanced. The actual rf power is then equal to the 
bias power removed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">According to another principle of measurement (the principle used in the unbalanced bridge), the 
bridge is not rebalanced after the rf power is applied. Rather, the indicator reading is converted directly 
into power by calibration previously performed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-16 illustrates the basic bolometer bridge circuit. The bolometer element must be physically 
small to be highly sensitive; it must be equally responsive to low-frequency and rf power; and it must be 
matched to the rf-input power line. The cross-sectional dimension of the bolometer element is 
approximately equal to the skin depth of rf current penetration at the highest frequency of operation. This 
condition permits the dc and rf resistivities to be essentially equal with the reactive component of the 
bolometer impedance at a minimum. Thermistors, which are a type of bolometer, use semiconductor 
material shaped like a bead, with a thicker skin depth and shorter length to minimize standing-wave 
effects. These physical properties assure correspondence between lengthwise low-frequency and rf power 
distribution to provide the necessary inherent accuracy of the bolometer. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">An air-mounted bolometer provides a power sensitivity 100 or more times greater than that provided 
by static calorimetric devices. Additional sensitivity may be obtained by mounting the element within an 
evacuated envelope to eliminate convective heat loss. The small size of bolometer elements is associated 
with small thermal mass and short thermal time constants. The thermal time constant varies directly with 
the volume-to-area ratio of the element for a particular shape and composition. Typical time is up to 0.1 </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

like mixture of metallic oxides having a large negative temperature coefficient of resistance. Two fine 
platinum-alloy wires are embedded in the bead, after which the bead is heated and coated with a glass 
film. Typical dimensions of a thermistor bead used for microwave measurements are 0.015 inch along its 
major axis and 0.010 inch along its minor axis. The thermistor bead may be operated at high 
temperatures; it is rugged, both electrically and mechanically; it has high resistance-power sensitivity; and 
it has a good temperature-power sensitivity. In addition, it can endure large pulse energies; it has a 
sluggish thermal response; and it has negligible pulsed-power measurement errors. The more sensitive 
thermistor requires thermal shielding or heat compensation for best operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-14. What type of material is used in the construction of bolometers and thermistors? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Bolometer Power Meter 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The standard power meter used in the Navy (Hewlett-Packard 431 C) is an automatic self-balancing 
instrument employing dual-bridge circuits. It is designed to operate with temperature-compensated 
thermistor mounts that enable you to measure power in a 50-ohm coaxial system from 10 MHz to 18 GHz 
and in a waveguide system from 2.6 GHz to 40 GHz. This power meter can be operated from either an ac 
or a dc primary power source. The ac source can be either 115 or 230 volts at 50 to 400 hertz. The dc 
source is a 24-volt rechargeable battery. A seven-position range switch allows full-scale power 
measurements of 10 microwatts to 10 milliwatts or of −20 dBm to +10 dBm. These ranges can be further 
extended with the aid of attenuators. The thermistor mount (as shown in fig. 3-17) contains two 
thermistors: one in the detection bridge, which absorbs the microwave power to be measured, and the 
other in the compensation and metering bridge, which supplies temperature compensation and converts 
the measured rf power to a meter indication. Each bridge includes its respective thermistor element as a 
bridge arm. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

10-kHz power to bias the thermistor in feedback loop 1 to produce the resistance required to balance the 
rf bridge. An equal amount of 10-kHz power is supplied by the same oscillator to the second thermistor in 
feedback loop 2 through two series-connected transformers. Feedback loop 2 balances the meter bridge. 
When rf is applied to the thermistor in the detection bridge (but not to the compensation and metering 
bridge), an amount of 10-kHz power is present, equal to the rf power being removed from the detection 
bridge by the self-balancing action of the bridge. Since the rf power replaced the 10-kHz power, the 
detection bridge is in balance; however, the metering bridge must be balanced by its separate feedback 
loop. Sufficient dc power to equal the 10-kHz power lost by the metering bridge is automatically 
replaced, balancing this loop. Hence the dc power applied to the metering bridge thermistor is equal to the 
microwave power applied to the detection bridge. The meter circuit senses the magnitude of the feedback 
current. The resultant meter current passes through a differential amplifier to the indicating meter. The 
two thermistors are matched with respect to their temperature characteristics; therefore, there is only a 
very small amount of drift of the zero point with ambient temperature changes. When there is a change in 
temperature, there is a change in the electrical power needed by the thermistors to maintain constant 
operating resistances. This change is automatically performed by feedback loop 1, which changes the 
amount of 10-kHz power for both thermistors by the proper amount. The dc power in feedback loop 2 is 
not changed; and since it is this dc power that is metered, the temperature change has not affected the 
meter indication.

the measurement of the heating effect on the medium, or load, terminating the line. Indirect heating 
requires the measurement of the heating effect on a medium or body other than the original power-
absorbing material. Power measurement with true calorimeter methods is based solely on temperature,

an adiabatic calorimeter using water as the body contained in a covered Dewar flask. A tapered-wall, 
open-ended waveguide contains a sealed, inclined glass partition to create a wedge-shaped water load of 
low-reflection coefficient. Thorough mixing of the water is accomplished with a stirrer, and a sensitive 
thermometer measures the temperature rise. A heating coil is wound around the waveguide inside the 
calorimeter and is used for calibrating purposes when low-frequency power is applied. This type of meter 
can be used for accurate measurement of several hundred watts of average power and can withstand 50

</p><p class="paragraph">The NONADIABATIC calorimeter uses an rf termination with a resistive film strip or LOSSY 
dielectric materials (solids or liquids that are designed to efficiently dissipate the applied power) as a load. 
Temperature indication can be accomplished with thermocouples, thermopiles, thermistors, 
thermometers, bimetallic strips, and manometers. Calibration is against a power standard or known low-
frequency power. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Based on the above principle, a coaxial calorimeter of good sensitivity with a short, 50-ohm resistive 
film on a lava (dielectric) center conductor, enclosed within a tapered, thin-walled outer conductor, is 
used for frequencies between 0 and 1.2 GHz. The rf termination is electrically connected to, but thermally 
isolated from, a massive mounting plate by a short section of silvered-lava coaxial line with a high 
thermal resistance. The steady-state temperature rise of the outer casing of the load with respect to the 
mounting plate is measured by a differential platinum-resistance thermometer in a Wheatstone bridge. 
Low-frequency power applied to the termination provides a method of calibration. Power in the range of 
0 to 2.5 watts may be measured. A 70-second time constant and steady-state temperatures are attained in 
about 6 minutes. The small physical size of termination (to keep convective and radiative heat losses low) 
provides high sensitivity. Calibration with lower frequency power is extremely accurate, because the 
termination is broadband and should exhibit the same power distribution from dc to 10 gigahertz. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A twin calorimeter provides a method of using two calorimetric bodies thermally shielded against 
ambient temperature variations and improves sensitivity. Figure 3-20 illustrates this type of calorimetric 
device. The power to be measured is applied to one calorimetric body; the other calorimetric body acts as 
a temperature reference. The steady-state temperature difference between the two calorimeters is used as 
a measure of rf power. Calibration is performed by applying low-frequency power. A differential-air, 
thermometer-type temperature difference indicator, shown in figure 3-21, is used with a twin calorimeter 
to measure microwave power in the 0.1-mW range. This instrument consists of two similar glass cells 
connected by a capillary tube containing a liquid pellet. Each glass cell contains a tapered, carbon-coated 
strip; and the entire assembly is mounted in a rectangular waveguide. Balancing dc power heats one strip; 
the other strip is heated by rf power. The liquid pellet, which indicates the differential expansion of the air 
within the two cells, is viewed through an aperture in the waveguide wall, preferably with a microscopy 
for highest sensitivity. This procedure permits a 2% accuracy at 10 mW.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Flow Calorimeters 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Flow calorimeters are classified by the type of circulating method used (open or closed), the type of 
heating used (direct or indirect), and the type of measurement performed (true calorimetric or 
substitution). Water or other calorimetric fluid is used only once in an open system. An overflow system 
is used to maintain a constant rate of flow. Closed systems recirculate the fluid continuously by means of 
a pump, and a cooling system restores the fluid to ambient temperatures prior to its return to the 
calorimeter. Closed systems are more elaborate and permit the use of fluids other than water. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Flow calorimeters provide the primary standards for the measurement of high power levels; and, in 
conjunction with calibrated directional couplers, attenuators, power dividers, or other similar devices 
serve to standardize medium- and low-power measuring instruments. The measurement time depends on 
the required time for the entering fluid to reach the outlet, where the rise in temperature is measured. The 
circulating fluid may serve in a dual capacity as the dissipative medium and coolant, using the direct 
heating method, or solely as a coolant, using the indirect heating method. Because of its excellent thermal 
properties and high dielectric losses at 1 GHz or higher, water is normally used in both heating methods. 
Water is rarely used as the fluid at frequencies lower than 100 MHz, because of insufficient dielectric 
losses. The indirect heating method offers a wider frequency and power-range coverage and can be used 
in substitution-type measurements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">True calorimetric measurements contain appreciable error, because of nonuniformity of flow rate, air 
bubbles, flow-rate measurement inaccuracies, and temperature rise. Flow regulators, bubble traps, and 
good thermal insulation are required to eliminate the majority of these errors. Substitution methods do not 
involve direct heat dissipation measurement of moving fluid. Greater accuracy is obtained because known 
low-frequency power is substituted for the unknown rf power, with all other measurement parameters 
remaining constant. The accuracy depends on the exactness of the low-frequency power determination 
and the degree to which factors remain fixed during the substitution of one type of power with another.

measurement techniques are possible with this type of meter: the calibration technique and the balance

</h2><p class="paragraph">Frequency measurements are an essential part of preventive and corrective maintenance for 
communication and electronic equipment. Rotation frequencies of some mechanical devices must be 
determined; the output frequency of electric power generators is checked when the engine is started and 
during preventive maintenance routines; carrier equipment that operates in the audio-frequency range 
must be adjusted to operate at the correct frequencies; and radio transmitters must be accurately tuned to 
the assigned frequencies to provide reliable communications and to avoid interfering with radio circuits 
operating on other frequencies. These are only a few of the applications for making frequency 
measurements. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FREQUENCY-MEASUREMENT-METHODS-3-26-">FREQUENCY-MEASUREMENT METHODS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Frequency-measuring equipment and devices, particularly those used to determine radio frequencies, 
constitute a distinct class of test equipment, because of the important and critical nature of such 
measurements. The requirement of precise calibration is extremely important in all frequency-measuring 
work. To provide accurate measurements, every type of frequency-measuring device must be calibrated 
against some frequency standard. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FREQUENCY-STANDARDS-3-26-">FREQUENCY STANDARDS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Of considerable importance in the measurements of frequency or wavelength are the standards 
against which frequency-measuring devices are compared and calibrated. Frequency standards belong to 
two general categories: primary and secondary standards. The PRIMARY FREQUENCY STANDARD 
maintained by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards has long-term stability and an accuracy of 1 part in 
1012, using an atomic clock. A SECONDARY FREQUENCY STANDARD is a highly stable and 
accurate standard that has been calibrated against the primary standard. Secondary standards are 
maintained by calibration laboratories that service your test equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The National Bureau of Standards provides time and frequency standards from station WWV at Fort 
Collins, Colorado, and from station WWVH at Kekaha, Kauai, Hawaii. The following technical radio

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MECHANICAL-ROTATION-AND-VIBRATION-METHODS-3-28-">MECHANICAL ROTATION AND VIBRATION METHODS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are many instances when you are very much concerned with the question of rotational or 
vibratory speeds. Knowledge of rotational speeds is necessary where the output of a direct current 
generator has fallen below a minimum desired output or where the speed of a motor (such as the motor in 
a teletypewriter or radar antenna) must be maintained at a constant value. There are many instruments that 
you can use for this purpose, such as tuning forks, stroboscopes, vibrating-reed meters, and 
electromechanical counters. The oscilloscope and the frequency counter are two of the other devices 
which may be used, but their use may require the employment of accessory equipment. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tuning Fork Methods 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A tuning fork is generally used in conjunction with the measurement of the rotational speed of a 
teletypewriter or facsimile motor but is not limited to this application. However, you must remember that 
the tuning fork can be used at only one frequency, the frequency of vibration for which it was 
manufactured, and therefore cannot be used on variable-speed motors. To use the tuning fork, you direct a 
source of light upon the point to be observed. In the case of a teletypewriter, a black-and-white segmented 
target is painted on the outer circumference of the motor governor. Radial spokes in a flywheel could be 
used equally well. Permit the motor to reach operational speed under normal load conditions; otherwise, 
the motor will slow down considerably when the normal load is applied. Strike the tuning fork against the 
side of your hand to set it into vibration. Then observe the target through the slots in the plates attached to 
the tines of the fork. The correct speed is obtained when the segments of the target appear to be 
stationary. If the segments seem to move backward, apparently against the known motor rotational 
direction, the speed is too low. If the segments seem to move forward, the speed is too high. There is also 
the possibility that the target segments will appear to jump back and forth or to disappear suddenly. Such 
erratic action is often because of governor malfunctioning. The correct speed adjustment is reached when 
the targets appear to be stationary.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Stroboscope Methods 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When using a stroboscope to measure the speed of rotating or reciprocating mechanisms, hold the 
instrument so that the light from the stroboscope lamp falls directly on the part to be observed. If the part 
is uniform, or symmetrical, place an identification mark with chalk or a grease pencil on the portion to be 
observed. This method provides a positive means of identification, because if only one reference mark is 
observed during measurement, you can be sure that either the fundamental synchronization or a 
submultiple thereof has been obtained. If the approximate speed of rotation is known, the stroboscope 
controls may be set to the appropriate positions prior to actual measurement. The main frequency control 
that determines the rate of the flashing light is then varied until the reference mark on the moving part 
appears to be standing still. The calibrated scale of the stroboscope will then show the speed directly in 
revolutions per minute (rpm). 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you have no idea of the speed of the moving part, it is best to start the measurement procedure at 
the highest frequency that the stroboscope can deliver. The flashing rate of the stroboscope can then be 
gradually reduced until a single stationary image of the reference mark is obtained. This is the point of 
fundamental synchronism that corresponds to the speed of the moving part. Do not continue to reduce the 
flashing rate of the instrument beyond this point without a valid reason for doing so. If you do continue 
the reduction, a stationary image will still be observed, but the stroboscope will indicate a submultiple of 
the true rotational speed; thus, a measurement error will be introduced. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Stroboscopes generally have a high- and low-range switch. The typical low range is from 600 to 
3,600 rpm, and the upper range is from 3,600 to 15,000 rpm; there is a slight overlap in ranges to ensure 
reliable frequency coverage. In view of the limitation imposed by flasher tube life, the stroboscope should 
always be operated at a flashing rate that is as low as possible, consistent with the rotational speed of the 
observed part. If you should be required to operate this instrument over a long period of time, use a 
submultiple of the fundamental synchronous speed. The pattern will remain just as stationary, and the 
tube life will be greatly extended. In addition, the quality of the light is better at the lower ranges than at 
the upper end of the scale. Sometimes you will encounter a rotating or vibrating device that is moving 
faster (or slower) than the measuring range of the stroboscope will accommodate. Although such speeds 
can still be measured, you must use the multiple or submultiple synchronism points. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two methods of measuring high speeds. The first method is to obtain a single stationary 
image of the rotating object at a subharmonic speed relationship and to record that value as A. Then 
obtain a second single stationary image at the next lower subharmonic speed relationship, and record this 
value as B. The unknown speed may then be computed from the following formula: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, assume reading A was 4,000 rpm and reading B was 3,500 rpm. The computation 
would be as follows: </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The second method is used where the value of A × B becomes progressively smaller. The A reading 
is obtained as in the previous example (for the sake of easier computation, suppose that the A reading is 
still 4,000 rpm). Then obtain another submultiple reading for B, keeping in mind the number of times a 
stationary single image was observed. If a stationary single image was observed seven different times and 
the final B reading was 2,000 rpm, the calculation would become as follows: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">At speeds lower than the lowest range of the stroboscope, multiple images will be observed. For 
example, assume a dial reading of 900 rpm was obtained when two stationary images were observed. 
Then dividing the rpm by the number of images will give the unknown shaft speed, as shown below:

The fundamental measurement of frequency is accomplished by totaling the number of cycles into the 
counter for a precise period of time. The result is then displayed as an exact digital readout. The audio-
frequency signal must be of sufficient amplitude to trigger the counter. The AUTO-MANUAL switch 
provides two methods of frequency counter operation. One method is to initiate the count simultaneously 
with the initiation of the signal to be measured. With this method, the AUTO-MANUAL switch should be 
set to the MANUAL position. The second method assumes that the signal to be measured has been 
operating over some indefinite period of time and that it will continue to do so after a measurement has 
been taken (hence, only that segment of the signal required to make the frequency measurement is 
important). With this method, the AUTO-MANUAL switch is to be set to the AUTO position. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

widely used but lack the accuracy of frequency counters. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Frequency Meters

</p><p class="paragraph">This process involved heterodyning the frequency to be measured against the calibrated output of the 
frequency meter to obtain a zero beat from which the measured frequency was then read. This method 
proved inaccurate because of reading errors. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Frequency meters as we know them today are entirely different from their predecessors. Today's 
frequency meters (fig. 3-26) contain waveguide or coaxial lines coupled to quarter-wavelength resonant 
cavities. The meter is adjusted until the cavity is tuned to the resonant frequency of the signal being 
measured. At resonance, power is absorbed by the cavity and produces a dip in the output-power level, as 
measured at the frequency meter's output connector. The resonant frequency is read directly from the 
frequency meter dial and is accurate, in most cases, to approximately ±0.2%. Frequency meters are 
capable of measuring frequencies in the range of 1 to 40 gigahertz, far exceeding the frequency 
limitations of the average frequency counter.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Frequency Counters 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the early 1950s, the frequency counter was developed. The device could measure and accurately 
indicate frequencies up to 10 MHz. Present-day frequency counters can accurately read frequencies as 
high as 40 GHz. In addition to direct frequency measurement indication, some types of frequency 
counters can measure the WAVE PERIOD, which is the inverse of frequency; RATIO, which compares 
one frequency against another; and TIME INTERVAL, the time between two events or the time between 
two functions of an event. In addition, frequency counters can totalize event indications. This is similar to 
measuring the frequency except that a manual or an electronic start-stop gate controls the time over which 
the measurement is taken. Frequency counters can also provide scaling in the form of a digital output 
signal from the frequency counter that represents a frequency-related division of the input frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">All of the above functions have useful applications. For pulse timing, the period function is used; 
totalizing is used in digital applications; and ratio is used in comparing harmonic-related signals. Scaling 
is used for triggering other test equipment used in conjunction with the frequency counter; and time-
interval capability is used in measuring the interval between two pulses or between two sets of pulses. 
Because of the wide variety of frequency counters in use, the technical manual for a specific frequency 
counter should be consulted to determine the instrument's full capabilities. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Frequency Counter Accuracy 
</h3><p class="paragraph">All frequency counter measurements are measured with 1 part in 108 of accuracy. However, 
frequency counters have provisions for input from external frequency standards. This extends the 
accuracy of the frequency to that of the standard. A frequency self-check capability is provided to 
determine if the counting and lighting circuits are operating properly. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Wavemeters 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Wavemeters are calibrated resonant circuits used to measure frequency. Although the accuracy of 
wavemeters is not as high as that of heterodyne frequency meters, they have the advantage of being 
comparatively simple and can be easily carried about. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Any type of resonant circuit may be used in wavemeter applications. The exact kind of circuit 
employed depends on the frequency range for which the meter is intended. Resonant circuits consisting of 
coils and capacitors are used for low-frequency wavemeters. Butterfly circuits, adjustable transmission 
line sections, and resonant cavities are used in vhf and microwave instruments. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are three basic kinds of wavemeters: the absorption, the reaction, and the transmission types. 
Absorption wavemeters are composed of the basic resonant circuit, a rectifier, and a meter for indicating 
the amount of current induced into the wavemeter. In use, this type of wavemeter is loosely coupled to the 
circuit to be measured. The resonant circuit of the wavemeter is then adjusted until the current meter 
shows a maximum deflection. The frequency of the circuit under test is then determined from the 
calibrated dial of the wavemeter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The reaction type derives its name from the fact that it is adjusted until a marked reaction occurs in 
the circuit being measured. For example, the wavemeter is loosely coupled to an oscillator, and the 
resonant circuit of the meter is adjusted until it is in resonance with the oscillator frequency. The setting 
of the wavemeter dial is made by observing the output current of the oscillator. At resonance, the 
wavemeter circuit takes energy from the oscillator, causing the current to dip sharply. The frequency of 
the oscillator is then determined from the calibrated dial of the wavemeter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The transmission wavemeter is an adjustable coupling link. When it is inserted between a source of 
rf energy and an indicator, energy is transmitted to the indicator only when the wavemeter is tuned to the 
frequency of the source. Transmission wavemeters are widely used in measuring microwave frequencies.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The wavemeter illustrated is of the type commonly used for the measurement of microwave 
frequencies. The device employs a resonant cavity, which effectively acts as a high-Q LC tank circuit. 
The resonant frequency of the cavity is varied by means of a plunger that is mechanically connected to a 
micrometer mechanism. Movement of the plunger into the cavity reduces the cavity size and increases the 
resonant frequency. Conversely, an increase in the size of the cavity (made by withdrawing the plunger) 
lowers the resonant frequency. The microwave energy from the equipment under test is fed into the 
wavemeter through one of two inputs, A or D. A crystal rectifier then detects or rectifies the signal, and 
the rectified current is indicated on the current meter, M. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The instrument can be used as either a transmission type or an absorption type of wavemeter. When 
used as a transmission wavemeter, the unknown signal is coupled into the circuit by means of input A. 
When the cavity is tuned to the resonant frequency of the signal, energy is coupled through coupling loop 
B into the cavity and out through loop C to the crystal rectifier where it is rectified and indicated on the 
meter. At frequencies off resonance little or no current flows in the detector and the meter reading is 
small. Therefore, the micrometer and attached plunger are varied until a maximum meter reading is 
obtained. The micrometer setting is then compared with a calibration chart supplied with the wavemeter 
to determine the unknown frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the unknown signal is relatively weak, such as the signal from a klystron oscillator, the 
wavemeter is usually used as an absorption type of device. Connection is made to the instrument at input  
D. Rf loop C then acts as an injection loop to the cavity. When the cavity is tuned to the resonant 
frequency of the klystron, maximum energy is absorbed by the cavity, and the current indicated on the 
meter dips. When the cavity is not tuned to the frequency of the klystron, high current is indicated on the 
current meter. Therefore, the cavity is tuned for a minimum reading, or dip, in the meter; and the resonant 
frequency is determined from the micrometer setting and the calibration chart. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h1><p class="paragraph">The following is a brief summary of the important points of this chapter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">All IMPEDANCE BRIDGES have several things in common. Each type of bridge has a comparing 
circuit and a measuring circuit. They measure an unknown impedance by comparing the characteristics of 
the device under test with the characteristics of components within the test set. 
</p><p class="paragraph">POWER METERS that are designed to measure af power can be separated into two distinct groups. 
Power meters that are designed for measuring sine waves are basically electronic voltmeters calibrated in 
dB or dBm. VU METERS are designed to measure the average value of complex waveforms, such as a 
voice. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The most common type of test equipment used to measure rf power is the ABSORPTION POWER 
METER. Absorption power meters are designed to absorb all or part of the signal being measured. 
Examples of absorption power meters are output power meters, in-line wattmeters, and meters employing 
bolometers. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">CALORIMETERS are the most accurate type of test equipment used for measuring high power. As 
power is applied to a calorimeter, its medium (either liquid or solid) is heated. The heat that is produced is 
directly proportional to the amount of applied power. The amount of applied power is determined by 
measuring the change in temperature of the medium. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Today's ELECTRONIC FREQUENCY COUNTERS are capable of measuring frequencies from 
dc to 40 GHz. Most have added features that enable period averaging, time-interval measurements, and 
scaling. Frequency counter accuracy can be extended by using an external frequency standard in lieu of 
its internal frequency standard.

</p><p class="learningobjective">1. Identify the various methods of measuring standing-wave ratios.
</p><p class="learningobjective">2. Identify the various methods of determining electrical losses caused by deterioration of

</p><p class="learningobjective">3. Identify the methods of measuring intermodulation distortion.
</p><p class="paragraph">INTRODUCTION TO QUALITATIVE MEASUREMENTS
As a technician, you are responsible for repairing and maintaining complex electronic systems. The
</p><p class="paragraph">basic ability to repair a specific piece of equipment is only the first step in becoming a qualified
technician. Your ultimate goal should be to become proficient at systems fault isolation — in other words,
to know the entire system like the back of your hand. To reach this goal you will need to be familiar with
all parts of the system and know how they are interconnected and interact with each other. There are
numerous shortcuts or tricks of the trade that can only be learned through experience on any system, but
the most practical thing for you to remember is to approach all problems in a logical manner.
</p><p class="paragraph">Various combinations of electronic equipment are interconnected to form a system capable of
performing specific functions. You must be able to apply general test methods and practices to
installation, tuning, maintenance, and repair of the system. This requires you to have a thorough
knowledge of many types of electronic equipment. When radar, communication, and digital computers
are interconnected, they require different maintenance procedures than when they are operated separately.
Revised test procedures may be necessary. Detrimental interactions between equipment or facilities must
be corrected and effective preventive maintenance procedures must be planned for all equipment within
the system. System quality figures, such as sensitivity and coverage, must be determined and measured
during equipment preventive maintenance checks to assure efficient operation. System monitoring at
specific test points is often used to help localize a problem.
</p><p class="paragraph">System testing and monitoring are frequently accomplished by using an external piece of electronic
equipment, which is designed specifically for testing a particular system. Some computers and computer
systems build in their own monitoring and testing devices and will inform the operator when and where
failure has occurred. You must realize that any equipment designed to test, monitor, or repair another
system is itself subject to malfunction and will require periodic checks and preventive maintenance. This
chapter will cover some of the basic test methods and practices associated with system-level
troubleshooting.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">STANDING-WAVE RATIO (SWR) MEASUREMENTS
Standing-wave ratio (swr) is the ratio of the maximum voltage or current to the minimum voltage or
</h3><p class="paragraph">current at any point along a transmission line. Swr measurements are used to determine the matching
quality of the termination of the line.
</p><p class="paragraph">A variety of methods and test equipments may be used to measure the voltage or current distribution
along a transmission line. An open transmission line is accessible for coupling to many types of voltage-
measuring devices, such as a wavemeter or a grid-dip meter. However, at higher frequencies where
coaxial cables or waveguides are used to minimize skin effect losses, (discussed in NEETS, module 10)
access is more complicated. Access to the interior of the waveguide or center conductor of the coaxial
cable must be gained by using a unidirectional or bidirectional coupler, which is inserted into the
transmission line. The coupler contains a slot into which an rf probe is inserted and positioned with
respect to directivity.
</p><p class="paragraph">The conditions that produce standing waves and their adverse effects are discussed in detail in
NEETS, module 10. The different methods of detecting and measuring standing waves are discussed in
the following paragraphs.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PROBES-4-2-">PROBES
</h2><p class="paragraph">A magnetic or electric probe can be used to observe the standing wave on a short-circuited,
terminated line. The wavelength is obtained by measuring the distance between alternate maximum or
minimum current points along the line. A typical setup operating at 300 megahertz might use two 10-foot
lengths of number 14 phosphor-bronze wires, which are spaced 1 inch apart and supported parallel to a set
of probe guide rails. The line should be partially matched to the source generator by means of a parallel-
wire shorting stub connected in parallel with the transmission line and the oscillator output line. Figure 4-
1, view A and view B, illustrates the types of probes required for this method of measurement.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-NEON-LAMP-AND-MILLIAMMETER-METHODS-4-3-">NEON-LAMP AND MILLIAMMETER METHODS
</h2><p class="paragraph">In this method of measurement, a neon bulb or milliammeter is moved along the two-wire parallel
transmission line. Points of maximum voltage (standing-wave voltage peaks) with the lamp or points of
maximum current (standing-wave current peaks) with the indicator will have maximum brilliance or
indication, respectively.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-1. At what points along a transmission line will a neon lamp glow the brightest?
BRIDGE METHODS
</p><p class="paragraph">The bridge method permits measurement of the standing-wave ratio without actually measuring the
standing waves. The bridge method is applicable because the input impedance of a line terminated in its
characteristic impedance is a pure resistance equal to the characteristic impedance. A line terminated in
this way can be used as the unknown resistance in a bridge circuit and a null can be obtained in the
indicating device when the other resistance arms of the bridge are properly adjusted.
</p><p class="paragraph">Many types of bridges can be used. For example, an ac bridge that is independent of the applied
frequency can be used. The bridge will become unbalanced when the line is no longer properly
terminated. Improper termination will produce a reactive component as well as a resistive component in
the input impedance of the line and result in a standing wave. The reading of the indicating device
depends on the degree of imbalance, which becomes more severe as the mismatch caused by the
termination becomes worse. The indicating device can be calibrated directly to indicate the standing-wave
ratio. The most common indicator consists of a crystal rectifier, a filtering circuit, and a sensitive dc meter
movement in series with a high resistance.

</p><p class="paragraph">However, the applied frequency must be low enough to avoid skin effect, stray inductance,
capacitance, and coupling between circuit elements and wiring. The leads must be kept short to eliminate
stray reactance, which causes bridge imbalance. The rectifier circuit wiring must be isolated from other
bridge component fields so that induced voltages do not cause an erroneous indication. You should only
use resistors having negligible capacitance and inductance effects.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before you calibrate a newly constructed bridge, the following procedure must be followed if
residual readings caused by stray effects are to be held to a minimum:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Connect a noninductive resistor (RL in view B) that is equal to the characteristic impedance of the
line to the output terminals of the bridge.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Apply an rf voltage to the input terminals and adjust the variable capacitor for a minimum reading

5. Reconnect the bridge in the normal manner (resistor RL to the output terminals, etc.). If the meter
</p><p class="paragraph">reading is now more than 1% or 2% of the full-scale reading, different arrangements (lead dress)
of the internal wiring must be tried until the null is reduced to 0 or as close as possible to the 0
point.
</p><p class="paragraph">The bridge can be calibrated after completion of the preceding check. Connect the transmission line
under investigation to the output terminals of the bridge and connect a succession of noninductive
resistors (RO in view C) to the load end of the transmission line until the bridge is balanced. Assuming
that the bridge was originally balanced for the characteristic impedance of the line, the standing-wave
ratio can be computed from the following equation:
</p><p class="paragraph">Select the formula that yields a ratio greater than unity. The swr calibration can be recorded on the
meter scale directly, recorded on a chart in terms of the meter deflection, or plotted on a graph against the
meter deflection. The variable capacitor, in turn, can be calibrated for various characteristic impedances.
This is accomplished by applying suitable resistors (RO) across the output terminals and noting the
capacitor settings at the respective balance points. A range of 50 to 300 ohms should prove attainable.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

time a calibrated instrument is used. Essentially, this adjustment is a repetition of the previously described
reversed-bridge procedure. The following steps are to be performed:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Connect the line to the input terminals of the bridge and connect the transmitter to the output
terminals.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Adjust the transmitter coupling until full-scale deflection is obtained. From this point on, the

the total output impedance sensed by the rf source must be equal to the internal impedance of that source.
A perfect impedance match between transmitter and load would exist if the swr were 1 to 1. As discussed
in NEETS, module 10, test equipment designed to measure the instantaneous voltage of a standing wave
will give you a voltage standing-wave ratio (vswr). Test equipment designed to measure the instantaneous
current component of a standing wave will give you the current standing-wave ratio (iswr). Regardless of
the type of test equipment selected, both ratios will be the same.

measurement as shown in figure 4-4, you move the detector along the slotted line so that its probe is at a
voltage maximum and adjust the gain of the meter with the RANGE-DB, GAIN, and VERNIER controls
(EXPAND switch to NORM) for full-scale deflection (1.0 on the 1.0 to 4 SWR scale). Then move the
probe toward a minimum. If the meter drops below 3.2, rotate the RANGE-DB switch one position
clockwise and read on the 3.2 to 10 SWR scale. If the pointer drops below this scale, rotate the RANGE-
DB switch one more position clockwise and read on the 1.0 to 4 scale and multiply by 10. This pattern
continues for still higher swr readings.
</p><p class="paragraph">The dB scales can be used for a standing-wave-ratio measurement by setting the meter to full scale at
a voltage maximum, then turning the RANGE-DB switch clockwise for an on-scale reading at a voltage
minimum and noting the difference in dB reading at the maximum and minimum. A dB reading is
obtained by adding the RANGE-DB switch setting and meter indication. The swr meter may also be used
for high resolution insertion loss measurements.
</p><p class="paragraph">The setup for performing insertion loss or attenuation measurements is shown in figure 4-5. It
requires that you initially establish a convenient reference on the DB scale of the meter. This is
accomplished by connecting the signal source directly to the detector and using the GAIN and VERNIER
controls to adjust the meter pointer to a convenient reference. Then you can insert the device to be
measured between the signal source and the detector and note the change in dB, as shown on the meter.

transmission line. Because all transmission lines contain some degree of resistance, some loss of power
will occur during the test.

the accuracy of this test, you should use the power meter to measure the output of the signal generator at
the end of the test cable to be attached to the transmission line. Any power loss associated with the test
cables should be recorded and subtracted from the measurement taken with the transmission line
connected.

over a specific range of frequencies. It is not uncommon for a transmission line to operate improperly at
one frequency, yet operate properly over the remainder of its frequency spectrum. You should check
transmission-line losses over their entire frequency range. Insertion loss measurements are normally taken
when a system is first installed or the transmission line is replaced. Periodic measurements should be
performed to enable you to determine if system performance is being degraded by transmission-line
deterioration.

our feeling that you should be familiar with the parameters that go into making a transmission line. It can
readily be seen by the above formulas that transmission lines cannot be randomly selected without

</h2><p class="paragraph">Intermodulation distortion occurs when two or more frequencies become mixed across a nonlinear
device. The resultants are the difference frequency and the sum frequency, both components of the
originals. Undesirable frequencies can be generated by a mixing of two discrete frequencies. Spurious
radiation, arising from close spacing of transmitter and receiver, is a prime source of an undesirable
frequency that can cause intermodulation distortion in an electronic circuit. This is particularly the case
when antenna couplers are employed. Cross modulation and parasitic generation (described in the next
section) are two other sources of undesirable frequencies that may cause intermodulation distortion.
</p><p class="paragraph"> Q-7. What is the main cause of intermodulation distortion?
CROSS MODULATION AND PARASITIC GENERATION
</p><p class="paragraph">CROSS MODULATION occurs when a signal from an adjacent channel crosses over into a second
channel and modulates the frequency of the second channel. PARASITIC GENERATION occurs when
regenerative feedback is sufficient to cause a circuit to oscillate, even though it is not designed to

some form of intermodulation distortion is present. To determine if external sources are causing the
intermodulation distortion, you can use a single-frequency signal. If the display on the spectrum analyzer
does not show the single frequency, then intermodulation distortion is present.
</p><p class="paragraph">Intermodulation distortion cannot be entirely suppressed, but it can be minimized by shielding
components and circuitry, parasitic suppression circuitry, and antenna spacing. These factors are
incorporated in the design of the system and are tested during production. Any shields or parasitic
suppressors that are removed by the technician must be replaced before troubleshooting and/or repair can
be effective. Antenna locations also pose a consideration when installing a new system. Ship alteration
specifications must be observed when new antenna systems are being installed.

</h1><p class="paragraph">The important points of this chapter are summarized in the following paragraphs:
</p><p class="paragraph">STANDING WAVES are the result of an impedance mismatch between a transmission line and its
load. If a transmission line is not properly terminated, it will cause a percentage of the transmitter power
to be reflected back to the source. The reflected wave or standing wave will increase in magnitude as the
mismatch becomes greater.
</p><p class="paragraph">VSWR refers to the voltage ratio of the incident wave (that which is transmitted to the load) and the
reflected wave (that which is reflected by the load back to the transmitter). An ideal vswr is considered to
be 1 to 1.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Standing waves that are present on a transmission line can be used to determine the
TRANSMITTER FREQUENCY. Voltage or current peaks are present at half-wavelength intervals. By
measuring the distance between peaks, you can compute frequency mathematically.
</p><p class="paragraph">TWO-WIRE, PARALLEL TRANSMISSION LINES are usually tested for standing waves with
test devices that are inductively coupled to the line. These test devices vary greatly in their complexity,
ranging from bridge circuits to simple neon lamps.
</p><p class="paragraph">INSERTION LOSS MEASUREMENTS are performed by injecting a signal of a known amplitude
into a transmission line and then monitoring the signal at the far end of the cable with a power meter.
Loss measurements must be taken at various frequencies to determine if the transmission line is good
across its frequency range.
</p><p class="paragraph">The most common cause of INTERMODULATION DISTORTION is improper spacing of
transmitters and receivers. CROSS MODULATION is common to equipment that is misaligned.
Intermodulation distortion can be tested by injecting two signals (different frequencies) into a piece of
equipment and then monitoring its output for distortion using a spectrum analyzer. Intermodulation
distortion is usually caused by improper antenna spacing or by poorly shielded components or circuits.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Measurements performed with oscilloscopes, time-domain reflectometers, and spectrum analyzers 
enable you to view the signal produced by the equipment or circuit under test. However, a visual display 
is of no value unless you are able to interpret the signal characteristics. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A displayed waveform is a representation of a varying signal related to time. You can graphically 
plot an unknown waveform by using a system of coordinates in which the amplitude of the unknown 
signal is plotted linearly against time. An analysis of the resultant waveform provides you with valuable 
information in determining the characteristics of many electronic (and some mechanical) devices. For 
example, the waveform of a signal may indicate the presence of harmonics or parasitic oscillations, or it 
may indicate how closely a device is following a desired cycle of operation. As the parts in an amplifier 
begin to shift in value or deteriorate, waveform distortion often occurs and indicates abnormal operation 
of a circuit and often precedes circuit breakdown. Malfunctioning of electrical or electronic circuits 
within equipment can usually be traced, by waveform inspection, to a specific part or parts of the circuit 
responsible for the distorted signal. On the basis of these facts, it is apparent that there is an important 
need for test equipment that can provide a visual presentation of a waveform at the instant of its 
occurrence in a circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DISTORTION is a term used by technicians and engineers alike that generally signifies 
dissatisfaction with the shape of the wave processed by an amplifier. Distortion of a waveform is the 
undesired change or deviation in the shape of the observed signal with respect to a reference waveform. 
Classifying any waveform as a distorted wave without reference to the electronic circuitry involved is 
meaningless. A waveform that can be validly termed distorted with respect to a specific amplifier circuit 
may be the normal waveform to be expected from another amplifier circuit. One of the most important 
steps in waveform analysis, the one that usually proves the most difficult for the maintenance personnel, 
is the interpretation of patterns viewed on the test equipment.

interpretation. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MODULATION-MEASUREMENTS-5-2-">MODULATION MEASUREMENTS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Modulation measurements are sometimes required during tuning procedures to adjust transmitting 
equipment for the proper amount of modulation. During maintenance tests of modulated transmitter 
equipment, you should determine the amount of distortion in the output signal and the modulation level or 
index. The modulation level in multiplexing equipment is usually set at the factory or during corrective 
maintenance procedures. Proper adjustment of the input signal level and automatic signal-level regulation 
circuits provides the correct amount of modulation. Defects in modulation circuits of a transmitter can be 
detected by measurements of the quality of the received signals at the receiver. Corrective maintenance 
analysis of multiplex equipment modulation circuits can usually be made by signal-level measurements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Some radio transmitters, when operating in the AM mode, must be adjusted for correct modulation 
during normal tuning procedures. If the modulation level is low, the transmitter is not operating at its 
maximum efficiency. On the other hand, modulation in excess of 100% produces serious distortion. Since 
neither of these conditions is desirable, amplitude modulation should be maintained between 60% and 
95% when possible. The modulation level or index of AM and fm radio transmitters that operate in the 
vhf range is initially adjusted by the manufacturer or during corrective maintenance. The amplifier gain of 
the modulator can be initially adjusted by reference to the modulation meter provided on the front panel 
of the equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Pulse modulation of radar and radio beacon signals can be measured by waveform displays presented 
on a standard oscilloscope. The amount of usable energy in a pulsed waveform, as measured by a 
spectrum analyzer, is also an indication of the pulse modulation quality. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Attaining 100% amplitude modulation of an rf carrier with a sine wave requires a modulating power 
equal to one-half of the rf carrier power. Under this condition, the average power of the modulated carrier 
is equal to 1.5 times the average unmodulated carrier power. The added power is divided equally between 
the upper and lower sidebands. During the peaks of 100% modulation, the amplitude of the carrier is 
doubled. This will cause the instantaneous peak power to be four times the instantaneous unmodulated 
peak power P = E2/R. When voice modulation is employed, only the highest amplitude peaks can be 
allowed to modulate the carrier 100%. Since many speech components do not modulate the carrier 100%, 
the average power required for voice modulation is less than that required for modulation with a sine 
wave. Voice peaks usually modulate a carrier 100% when the modulation increases the average carrier 
output power 25% over its normal value. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-1. What is the result of overmodulating an AM signal? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Q-2. For AM transmissions, the carrier is normally modulated within what range? 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-AMPLITUDE-MODULATION-MEASUREMENTS-5-2-">AMPLITUDE-MODULATION MEASUREMENTS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">An increase in the power output of an AM transmitter is indicated by an increase in antenna current. 
The increase can be taken as a measure of the degree of modulation and can be expressed as a percentage, 
as shown in figure 5-1. The graph for this figure was developed from the relationship existing between the 
carrier power and the increased power resulting from the added modulation power. The formula for 
calculating the PERCENTAGE of MODULATION is as follows: </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

Normal broadcasting, however, is characterized by complex envelope patterns, as illustrated in figure 5-2. 
In this light, the previous formula is not so clear. Consequently, the preceding formula should be viewed 
more correctly as the PERCENTAGE OF POSITIVE PEAK MODULATION. When the minimum

produced by effects other than the modulation process — for example, parasitic oscillation, nonlinear

</p><p class="paragraph">Unfortunately, continuous variations in the percentage of modulation create a number of additional 
problems. For example, damping is necessary so that a meter can provide an average reading despite 
fluctuations. An average reading, on the other hand, will not disclose the presence of transient 
overmodulation. This shortcoming is serious because of the large number of sideband frequencies 
produced in addition to the normal ones whenever overmodulation occurs. Not only do these extra 
frequencies interfere drastically with other transmissions, but they also may significantly distort the 
modulation signal. These considerations account for the importance of using a meter that responds to </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">The oscilloscope is widely used as an amplitude-modulation monitor and measuring instrument. 
Since it is capable of presenting visual indications of the modulated output of AM transmitters, the 
oscilloscope is reliable for detecting overmodulation and determining the percentage of modulation. For 
example, the relative error of most measurements taken with a 5-inch crt is about 10%. Although such 
accuracy is adequate for many maintenance checks, the oscilloscope is usually considered more valuable 
as a monitor of general modulation conditions. It is also used to monitor the amplitude-modulated output 
of a radio transmitter when photographic records are desired. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Types of Modulation Display 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Two types of modulation patterns are provided by the oscilloscope, depending upon the hookup

tone to the input of the modulator. This, in turn, produces a significant drop in the plate voltage of the 
final output stage of the modulator. The correct setting of output plate voltage ensures that 
overmodulation will not occur. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SINGLE-SIDEBAND-MEASUREMENTS-5-6-">SINGLE-SIDEBAND MEASUREMENTS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Single-sideband modulation is a form of amplitude modulation in which only one sideband is 
transmitted with a suppressed carrier. Since balanced modulators are used to provide carrier cancellation, 
the exact balancing of the carriers to provide cancellation requires a null adjustment. The null can be 
observed and adjusted by using either a detector and an indicator, such as a voltmeter, or an oscilloscope 
for observation of the output while tuning the transmitter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Measurements peculiar to sideband technology also include special modulation-amplitude and 
modulation-distortion checks. If the sideband modulator is overdriven or mistuned or the associated linear 
amplifiers are improperly loaded or overdriven, spurious output frequencies are produced. These are 
harmonically related to the driving signals and can cause splatter over a large range of frequencies, thus 
causing interference to other transmitting stations. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To determine the proper amplitude so that the modulation will not cause distortion or splatter, you 
use the audio two-tone modulation test. The resulting signals are shown in views A, B, and C of figure 5-
6. The two-tone test is used for initial adjustment and for precise checking because it will indicate 
distortion. The two-tone test corresponds to the wave envelope method of AM modulation checking. Two 
signals of equal amplitude but of slightly different frequencies beating together are applied to the 
sideband modulator input to produce a single tone of approximately 1,000 hertz. On an oscilloscope, the </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">In frequency modulation, the carrier amplitude remains constant, and the output frequency of the 
transmitter is varied about the carrier (or mean) frequency at a rate corresponding to the audio 
frequencies. The extent to which the frequency changes in one direction from the unmodulated (carrier) 
frequency is called the FREQUENCY DEVIATION. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Deviation in frequency is usually expressed in kilohertz. It is equal to the difference between the 
carrier frequency and either the highest or lowest frequency reached by the carrier in its excursions with 
modulation. There is no modulation percentage in the usual sense. With suitable circuit design, the 
frequency deviation may be made as large as desired without encountering any adverse effects that are 
equivalent to the overmodulation in amplitude-modulation transmissions. However, the maximum 
permissible frequency deviation is determined by the width of the band assigned for station operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In frequency modulation, the equivalent of 100% modulation occurs when the frequency deviation is 
equal to a predetermined maximum value. There are several methods of measuring the modulation in 
frequency-modulated transmissions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The frequency-deviation measurement of a frequency-modulated signal is normally performed with 
either a spectrum analyzer or with a modulation analyzer. The modulation analyzer method is more 
commonly used because of its accuracy. Typical accuracies for a modulation analyzer are within ±1%.

purpose. Figure 5-8 illustrates the differences between frequency- and time-domain plots. View A

by the frequency of the modulating signal. The amount by which the frequency departs from the average 
is controlled by the amplitude of the modulating signal. This variation is referred to as the FREQUENCY 
DEVIATION of the frequency-modulated wave. We can now establish two clear-cut rules for frequency 
deviation rate and amplitude in frequency modulation: 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Amount of frequency shift is proportional to the amplitude of the modulating signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">(This rule simply means that if a 10-volt signal causes a frequency shift of 20 kilohertz, then a 20-
volt signal will cause a frequency shift of 40 kilohertz.) 
</p><p class="paragraph">• Rate of frequency shift is proportional to the frequency of the modulating signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">(This second rule means that if the carrier is modulated with a 1-kilohertz tone, then the carrier is 
changing frequency 1,000 times each second.)

modulating signal increases. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

analyzer display would show the lower lobes (shown below the reference line in the figure) on top 
because the spectrum analyzer does not retain any polarity information. Changing the pulse interval, or 
pulse width, of the modulation signal will change the amount of rails (prf), or number of lobe minima, as

reason for analyzing the spectrum is to determine the exact amount of amplitude and frequency

</h2><p class="paragraph">The information desired from the spectra to be analyzed determines the SPECTRUM ANALYZER 
requirements. Real-time analysis is used if a particular point in the frequency spectrum is to be analyzed, 
such as a line spectra display. Continuous- or swept-frequency analysis, which is the most common mode 
of observation, is used to display a wider portion of the frequency spectrum or (in some cases) the entire 
range of the spectrum analyzer in use. Changing the spectrum analyzer setting from one mode to another 
is accomplished by varying the scan time and the bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer or a combination of 
the two. Most real-time spectrum analyzers, however, are preceded by mechanical filters, which limit the 
input bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer to the desired spectra to be analyzed. Tunable- or swept-
spectrum analyzers function basically the same as heterodyne receivers, the difference being that the local 
oscillator is not used but is replaced by a voltage-controlled oscillator (vco). The vco is swept 
electronically by a ramp input from a sawtooth generator. The output of the receiver is applied to a crt, 
which has its horizontal sweep in synchronization with the vco. The lower frequency appears at the left of 
the crt display. As the trace sweeps to the right, the oscillator increases in frequency. Figure 5-24 is a 
block diagram of a heterodyne spectrum analyzer. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before the frequency of a signal can be measured on a spectrum analyzer, it must be RESOLVED. 
Resolving a signal means distinguishing it from other signals near it. Resolution is limited by the 
narrowest bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer because the analyzer traces out its own IF bandwidth shape 
as it sweeps through a signal. If the narrowest bandwidth is 1 kilohertz, the nearest any two signals can 
be, and still be resolved, is 1 kilohertz. Reducing the IF bandwidth indefinitely would obtain infinite 
resolution except that the usable IF bandwidth is limited by the stability of the spectrum analyzer. The 
smaller the IF bandwidth, the greater the capability of the analyzer to resolve closely spaced signals of 
unequal amplitudes. Modern spectrum analyzers have been refined to the degree that IF bandwidths are 
less than 1 hertz. 
</p><p class="paragraph">It is important that the spectrum analyzer be more stable in frequency than the signals being 
measured. The stability of the analyzer depends on the frequency stability of its vco. Scan time of the 
spectrum analyzer must be long enough, with respect to the amplitude of the signal to be measured, to 
allow the IF circuitry of the spectrum analyzer to charge and recover. This will prevent amplitude and 
frequency distortion. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TIME-DOMAIN-REFLECTOMETRY-5-24-">TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY is a testing and measurement technique that has found 
increasing usefulness in testing transmission lines (both metallic and fiber-optic), cables, strip lines, 
connectors, and other wideband systems or components. Basically, time-domain reflectometry is an 
extension of an earlier technique in which reflections from an electrical pulse were monitored to locate 
faults and to determine the characteristics of power transmission lines. You can compare time-domain 
reflectometry to a closed-loop radar system in which the transmitted signal, a very fast step pulse, is fed 
into the system and the reflections resulting from discontinuities or impedance deviations in the system 
are monitored on a crt. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The technique used in time-domain reflectometry consists of feeding an impulse of energy into the 
system and then observing that energy as it is reflected by the system at the point of insertion. When the 
fast-rise input pulse meets with a discontinuity or impedance mismatch, the resultant reflections appearing 
at the feed point are compared in phase, time, and amplitude with the original pulse. By analyzing the 
magnitude, deviation, and shape of the reflected waveform, you can determine the nature of the 
impedance variation in the transmission system. Also, since distance is related to time and the amplitude 
of the reflected step is directly related to impedance, the comparison indicates the distance to the fault as 
well as the nature of the fault. Figure 5-25, view A, view B, view C, and view D, illustrates typical 
transmission line problems that can easily be identified by using a time-domain reflectometer (tdr). In 
addition to showing both the distance to and the nature (resistive, inductive, or capacitive) of each line 
discontinuity, time-domain reflectometry also reveals the characteristic impedance of the line and 
indicates whether losses are shunt or series. They are also used to locate and analyze connectors and 
splices.

</p><p class="paragraph">A conventional method of evaluating high-frequency transmission systems and components has been 
through the use of standing wave ratio (swr) measurements to obtain an overall indication of transmission 
line performance. This method involves feeding a sine-wave signal into the system and measuring the 
maximum and minimum amplitudes of the standing waves that result from system discontinuities or load 
mismatches. The ratio between the minimum and maximum swr values is then taken as the system 
FIGURE OF MERIT. The swr measurement, however, does not isolate individual discontinuities or 
mismatches when multiple reflections are present; it only indicates their total effect. Time-domain 
reflectometry measurements, on the other hand, isolate the line characteristics in time (location). As a 
result, multiple reflections resulting from more than one discontinuity or impedance variation that are 
separated in distance on the line are also separated in time at the monitoring point and can be individually 
analyzed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Prior to the advent of time-domain reflectometers, time-domain reflectometry was performed with 
the aid of sampling oscilloscopes and pulse generators with very fast rise times. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 5-26 shows the earlier type of test setup, which is still an option. However, today's time-
domain reflectometers have several advantages over the old pulse-generator and oscilloscope methods. 
Modern time-domain reflectometers are compact, lightweight, are often supplied with battery pack 
options for field use, and provide a direct readout of distances instead of time. Some equipments provide 
a paper-tape recording for a permanent record. Figure 5-27 shows a typical time-domain reflectometer. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Figure 5-30 shows a typical tracking generator used with the Hewlett-Packard 141 T spectrum 
analyzer. A TRACKING GENERATOR is basically a sweep generator in which the sweep rate is 
matched to that of the spectrum analyzer. The output circuitry of the tracking generator contains a 
network that ensures a constant output amplitude over the entire range being swept. When the fm signal 
produced by the tracking generator is applied to a device or circuit under test, the instantaneous output 
amplitude is always proportional to the response of the circuit to the frequency at that instant. Thus, the 
original fm input signal is changed in passing through the circuit under test. The output signal, therefore, 
would consist of an fm signal that is also amplitude-modulated. For equal deviations, the positive and 
negative portions of this envelope are symmetrical, making it necessary to observe only one side of the 
envelope. After the detection stage in the spectrum analyzer, only the modulation remains to appear on 
the face of the crt. This presentation will appear as a continuous curve because of the persistence of vision 
and the phosphor characteristic of the crt. The polarity of the detector determines whether a positive or a 
negative output is displayed. The frequency at any point on the crt display can be analyzed by arresting 
the scan of the spectrum analyzer either electronically or manually at the point of interest. For greater 
accuracy in frequency determination, a frequency counter may be attached to the output of the tracking 
generator at the point of the arrested scan.

thus be maintained very close to the nominal value. With this arrangement, any impedance variation in 
the connecting cables, connectors, and adapters is effectively cancelled since these components are within 
the leveling loop. The attenuation of a device under test will be displayed on the associated crt as a 
continuous response curve as it is scanned. This will result in an attenuation versus frequency plot of the 
device under test only.

antenna to prevent damage to your test equipment. Figure 5-32 shows a typical hf transmitting antenna 
vswr display as measured using the swept-frequency technique. The setup for testing a receiving antenna 
vswr, shown in figure 5-33, is similar, with the exception of the attenuators. The measured vswr (within
