SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current
(dc). It also describes some of the general safety precautions and first-aid procedures that should be

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BACKGROUND-AND-HISTORY-1-2-">BACKGROUND AND HISTORY
</h2><p class="paragraph">Man’s earliest number or counting system was probably developed to help determine how many
possessions a person had. As daily activities became more complex, numbers became more important in
trade, time, distance, and all other phases of human life.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you have seen already, numbers are extremely important in your military and personal life. You
realize that you need more than your fingers and toes to keep track of the numbers in your daily routine.
</p><p class="paragraph">Ever since people discovered that it was necessary to count objects, they have been looking for easier
ways to count them. The abacus, developed by the Chinese, is one of the earliest known calculators. It is
still in use in some parts of the world.
</p><p class="paragraph">Blaise Pascal (French) invented the first adding machine in 1642. Twenty years later, an Englishman,
Sir Samuel Moreland, developed a more compact device that could multiply, add, and subtract. About
1672, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (German) perfected a machine that could perform all the basic
operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), as well as extract the square root. Modern electronic digital
computers still use von Liebniz's principles.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MODERN-USE-1-2-">MODERN USE
</h2><p class="paragraph">Computers are now employed wherever repeated calculations or the processing of huge amounts of
data is needed. The greatest applications are found in the military, scientific, and commercial fields. They
have applications that range from mail sorting, through engineering design, to the identification and
destruction of enemy targets. The advantages of digital computers include speed, accuracy, and man-
power savings. Often computers are able to take over routine jobs and release personnel for more
important work¾ work that cannot be handled by a computer.
</p><p class="paragraph">People and computers do not normally speak the same language. Methods of translating information
into forms that are understandable and usable to both are necessary. Humans generally speak in words
and numbers expressed in the decimal number system, while computers only understand coded electronic
pulses that represent digital information.
</p><p class="paragraph">In this chapter you will learn about number systems in general and about binary, octal, and
hexadecimal (which we will refer to as hex) number systems specifically. Methods for converting
numbers in the binary, octal, and hex systems to equivalent numbers in the decimal system (and vice
versa) will also be described. You will see that these number systems can be easily converted to the
electronic signals necessary for digital equipment.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TYPES-OF-NUMBER-SYSTEMS-1-2-">TYPES OF NUMBER SYSTEMS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Until now, you have probably used only one number system, the decimal system. You may also be
familiar with the Roman numeral system, even though you seldom use it.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-DECIMAL-NUMBER-SYSTEM-1-2-">THE DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM
</h2><p class="paragraph">In this module you will be studying modern number systems. You should realize that these systems
have certain things in common. These common terms will be defined using the decimal system as our
base. Each term will be related to each number system as that number system is introduced.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Each of the number systems you will study is built around the following components: the UNIT,
NUMBER, and BASE (RADIX).
Unit and Number
</p><p class="paragraph">The terms unit and number when used with the decimal system are almost self-explanatory. By
definition the unit is a single object; that is, an apple, a dollar, a day. A number is a symbol representing a
unit or a quantity. The figures 0, 1, 2, and 3 through 9 are the symbols used in the decimal system. These
symbols are called Arabic numerals or figures. Other symbols may be used for different number systems.
For example, the symbols used with the Roman numeral system are letters ¾ V is the symbol for 5, X for
10, M for 1,000, and so forth. We will use Arabic numerals and letters in the number system discussions
in this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Base (Radix)
The base, or radix, of a number system tells you the number of symbols used in that system. The
</p><p class="paragraph">base of any system is always expressed in decimal numbers. The base, or radix, of the decimal system is
10. This means there are 10 symbols ¾ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 ¾ used in the system. A number
system using three symbols ¾ 0, 1, and 2 ¾ would be base 3; four symbols would be base 4; and so
forth. Remember to count the zero or the symbol used for zero when determining the number of symbols
used in a number system.
</p><p class="paragraph">The base of a number system is indicated by a subscript (decimal number) following the value of the
number. The following are examples of numerical values in different bases with the subscript to indicate
the base:
</p><h3 class="subsection">759210        2145        1234        6567
</h3><p class="paragraph">You should notice the highest value symbol used in a number system is always one less than the base
of the system. In base 10 the largest value symbol possible is 9; in base 5 it is 4; in base 3 it is 2.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Positional Notation and Zero
</h3><p class="paragraph">You must observe two principles when counting or writing quantities or numerical values. They are
the POSITIONAL NOTATION and the ZERO principles.
</p><p class="paragraph">Positional notation is a system where the value of a number is defined not only by the symbol but by
the symbol’s position. Let’s examine the decimal (base 10) value of 427.5. You know from experience that
this value is four hundred twenty-seven and one-half. Now examine the position of each number:
</p><p class="paragraph">If 427.5 is the quantity you wish to express, then each number must be in the position shown. If you
exchange the positions of the 2 and the 7, then you change the value.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Each position in the positional notation system represents a power of the base, or radix. A POWER is
the number of times a base is multiplied by itself. The power is written above and to the right of the base
and is called an EXPONENT. Examine the following base 10 line graph:
</p><p class="paragraph">Now let’s look at the value of the base 10 number 427.5 with the positional notation line graph:
</p><p class="paragraph">You can see that the power of the base is multiplied by the number in that position to determine the
value for that position.
</p><p class="paragraph">The following graph illustrates the progression of powers of 10:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">All numbers to the left of the decimal point are whole numbers, and all numbers to the right of the
decimal point are fractional numbers. A whole number is a symbol that represents one, or more, complete
objects, such as one apple or $5. A fractional number is a symbol that represents a portion of an object,
such as half of an apple (.5 apples) or a quarter of a dollar ($0.25). A mixed number represents one, or
more, complete objects, and some portion of an object, such as one and a half apples (1.5 apples). When
you use any base other than the decimal system, the division between whole numbers and fractional
numbers is referred to as the RADIX POINT. The decimal point is actually the radix point of the decimal
system, but the term radix point is normally not used with the base 10 number system.
</p><p class="paragraph">Just as important as positional notation is the use of the zero. The placement of the zero in a number
can have quite an effect on the value being represented. Sometimes a position in a number does not have a
value between 1 and 9. Consider how this would affect your next paycheck. If you were expecting a
check for $605.47, you wouldn’t want it to be $65.47. Leaving out the zero in this case means a difference
of $540.00. In the number 605.47, the zero indicates that there are no tens. If you place this value on a bar
graph, you will see that there are no multiples of 101.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Most Significant Digit and Least Significant Digit (MSD and LSD)
Other important factors of number systems that you should recognize are the MOST SIGNIFICANT
</h3><p class="paragraph">DIGIT (MSD) and the LEAST SIGNIFICANT DIGIT (LSD).
The MSD in a number is the digit that has the greatest effect on that number.
</p><p class="paragraph">The LSD in a number is the digit that has the least effect on that number.
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at the following examples:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">You can easily see that a change in the MSD will increase or decrease the value of the number the
greatest amount. Changes in the LSD will have the smallest effect on the value. The nonzero digit of a
</p><p class="paragraph">number that is the farthest LEFT is the MSD, and the nonzero digit farthest RIGHT is the LSD, as in the
following example:
</p><p class="paragraph">In a whole number the LSD will always be the digit immediately to the left of the radix point.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Carry and Borrow Principles
</h3><p class="paragraph">Soon after you learned how to count, you were taught how to add and subtract. At that time, you
learned some concepts that you use almost everyday. Those concepts will be reviewed using the decimal
system. They will also be applied to the other number systems you will study.
</p><p class="paragraph">ADDITION¾ Addition is a form of counting in which one quantity is added to another. The
following definitions identify the basic terms of addition:
</p><h3 class="subsection">AUGEND¾ The quantity to which an addend is added
</h3><h3 class="subsection">ADDEND¾ A number to be added to a preceding number
</h3><h3 class="subsection">SUM ¾ The result of an addition (the sum of 5 and 7 is 12)
CARRY ¾ A carry is produced when the sum of two or more digits in a vertical column equals or
exceeds the base of the number system in use
</h3><p class="paragraph">How do we handle the carry; that is, the two-digit number generated when a carry is produced? The
lower order digit becomes the sum of the column being added; the higher order digit (the carry) is added
to the next higher order column. For example, let’s add 15 and 7 in the decimal system:
</p><p class="paragraph">Starting with the first column, we find the sum of 5 and 7 is 12. The 2 becomes the sum of the lower
order column and the 1 (the carry) is added to the upper order column. The sum of the upper order
column is 2. The sum of 15 and 7 is, therefore, 22.
</p><p class="paragraph">The rules for addition are basically the same regardless of the number system being used. Each
number system, because it has a different number of digits, will have a unique digit addition table. These
addition tables will be described during the discussion of the adding process for each number system.
</p><p class="paragraph">A decimal addition table is shown in table 1-1. The numbers in row X and column Y may represent
either the addend or the augend. If the numbers in X represent the augend, then the numbers in Y must
represent the addend and vice versa. The sum of X + Y is located at the point in array Z where the
selected X row and Y column intersect.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Table 1-1. —Decimal Addition Table
</p><p class="paragraph">To add 5 and 7 using the table, first locate one number in the X row and the other in the Y column.
The point in field Z where the row and column intersect is the sum. In this case the sum is 12.
</p><p class="paragraph">SUBTRACTION.¾ The following definitions identify the basic terms you will need to know to
understand subtraction operations:
</p><h3 class="subsection">• SUBTRACT¾ To take away, as a part from the whole or one number from another
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• MINUEND¾ The number from which another number is to be subtracted
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• SUBTRAHEND¾ The quantity to be subtracted
</h3><h3 class="subsection">• REMAINDER, or DIFFERENCE ¾ That which is left after subtraction
</h3><p class="paragraph">• BORROW ¾ To transfer a digit (equal to the base number) from the next higher order column
for the purpose of subtraction.
</p><p class="paragraph">Use the rules of subtraction and subtract 8 from 25. The form of this problem is probably familiar to
you:
</p><p class="paragraph">It requires the use of the borrow; that is, you cannot subtract 8 from 5 and have a positive difference.
You must borrow a 1, which is really one group of 10. Then, one group of 10 plus five groups of 1 equal
15, and 15 minus 8 leaves a difference of 7. The 2 was reduced by 1 by the borrow; and since nothing is
to be subtracted from it, it is brought down to the difference.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the process of subtraction is the opposite of addition, the addition table 1-1 may be used to
illustrate subtraction facts for any number system we may discuss.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">In addition,
</h3><h3 class="subsection">X + Y = Z
</h3><h3 class="subsection">In subtraction, the reverse is true; that is,
</h3><h3 class="subsection">Z – Y = X
</h3><h2 class="section" id="section-OR-1-9-">OR
</h2><h3 class="subsection">Z – X = Y
</h3><p class="paragraph">Thus, in subtraction the minuend is always found in array Z and the subtrahend in either row X or
column Y. If the subtrahend is in row X, then the remainder will be in column Y. Conversely, if the
subtrahend is in column Y, then the difference will be in row X. For example, to subtract 8 from 15, find
8 in either the X row or Y column. Find where this row or column intersects with a value of 15 for Z; then
move to the remaining row or column to find the difference.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-BINARY-NUMBER-SYSTEM-1-9-">THE BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM
</h2><p class="paragraph">The simplest possible number system is the BINARY, or base 2, system. You will be able to use the
information just covered about the decimal system to easily relate the same terms to the binary system.
Unit and Number
</p><p class="paragraph">The base, or radix¾ you should remember from our decimal section ¾ is the number of symbols used
in the number system. Since this is the base 2 system, only two symbols, 0 and 1, are used. The base is
indicated by a subscript, as shown in the following example:
</p><p class="pagenumber">12
</p><p class="paragraph">When you are working with the decimal system, you normally don't use the subscript. Now that you
will be working with number systems other than the decimal system, it is important that you use the
subscript so that you are sure of the system being referred to. Consider the following two numbers:
</p><h3 class="subsection">11      11
</h3><p class="paragraph">With no subscript you would assume both values were the same. If you add subscripts to indicate
their base system, as shown below, then their values are quite different:
</p><h3 class="subsection">1110      112
</h3><p class="paragraph">The base ten number 1110 is eleven, but the base two number 112 is only equal to three in base ten.
There will be occasions when more than one number system will be discussed at the same time, so you
MUST use the proper Subscript.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Positional Notation
</h3><p class="paragraph">As in the decimal number system, the principle of positional notation applies to the binary number
system. You should recall that the decimal system uses powers of 10 to determine the value of a position.
The binary system uses powers of 2 to determine the value of a position. A bar graph showing the
positions and the powers of the base is shown below:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">All numbers or values to the left of the radix point are whole numbers, and all numbers to the right of
the radix point are fractional numbers.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s look at the binary number 101.1 on a bar graph:
</p><p class="paragraph">Working from the radix point to the right and left, you can determine the decimal equivalent:
</p><p class="paragraph">Table 1-2 provides a comparison of decimal and binary numbers. Notice that each time the total
number of binary symbol positions increase, the binary number indicates the next higher power of 2. By
this example, you can also see that more symbol positions are needed in the binary system to represent the
equivalent value in the decimal system.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">MSD and LSD
</h3><p class="paragraph">When you’re determining the MSD and LSD for binary numbers, use the same guidelines you used
with the decimal system. As you read from left to right, the first nonzero digit you encounter is the MSD,
and the last nonzero digit is the LSD.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the number is a whole number, then the first digit to the left of the radix point is the LSD.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Here, as in the decimal system, the MSD is the digit that will have the most effect on the number; the
LSD is the digit that will have the least effect on the number.
</p><p class="paragraph">The two numerals of the binary system (1 and 0) can easily be represented by many electrical or
electronic devices. For example, 12 may be indicated when a device is active (on), and 02  may be
indicated when a device is nonactive (off).
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at the preceding figure. It illustrates a very simple binary counting device. Notice that 12 is
indicated by a lighted lamp and 02 is indicated by an unlighted lamp. The reverse will work equally well.
The unlighted state of the lamp can be used to represent a binary 1 condition, and the lighted state can
represent the binary 0 condition. Both methods are used in digital computer applications. Many other
devices are used to represent binary conditions. They include switches, relays, diodes, transistors, and
integrated circuits (ICs).
Addition of Binary Numbers
</p><p class="paragraph">Addition of binary numbers is basically the same as addition of decimal numbers. Each system has
an augend, an addend, a sum, and carries. The following example will refresh your memory:
</p><p class="paragraph">Since only two symbols, 0 and 1, are used with the binary system, only four combinations of
addition are possible.
</p><h3 class="subsection">0 + 0
</h3><h3 class="subsection">1 + 0
</h3><h3 class="subsection">0 + 1
</h3><h3 class="subsection">1 + 1</h3><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
<div class="page mainpage" id="24"><div class="centered">
            <div class="pagination">

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-13
</p><p class="paragraph">The sum of each of the first three combinations is obvious:
</p><h3 class="subsection">0 + 0 = 02
</h3><h3 class="subsection">0 + 1 = 12
</h3><h3 class="subsection">1 + 0 = 12
</h3><p class="paragraph">The fourth combination presents a different situation. The sum of 1 and 1 in any other number
system is 2, but the numeral 2 does not exist in the binary system. Therefore, the sum of 12 and 12 is 102
(spoken as one zero base two), which is equal to 210.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Complementary Subtraction
</h3><p class="paragraph">If you do any work with computers, you will soon find out that most digital systems cannot
subtract ¾ they can only add. You are going to need a method of adding that gives the results of
subtraction. Does that sound confusing? Really, it is quite simple. A COMPLEMENT is used for our
subtractions. A complement is something used to complete something else.
</p><p class="paragraph">In most number systems you will find two types of complements. The first is the amount necessary
to complete a number up to the highest number in the number system. In the decimal system, this would
be the difference between a given number and all 9s. This is called the nines complement or the radix-1 or
R’s-1 complement. As an example, the nines complement of 254 is 999 minus 254, or 745.
</p><p class="paragraph">The second type of complement is the difference between a number and the next higher power of the
number base. As an example, the next higher power of 10 above 999 is 1,000. The difference between
1,000 and 254 is 746. This is called the tens complement in the decimal number system. It is also called
the radix or R’s complement. We will use complements to subtract. Let’s look at the magic of this process.
There are three important points we should mention before we start: (1) Never complement the minuend
in a problem, (2) always disregard any carry beyond the number of positions of the largest of the original
numbers, and (3) add the R’s complement of the original subtrahend to the original minuend. This will
have the same effect as subtracting the original number. Let’s look at a base ten example in which we
subtract 38 from 59:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
<div class="page mainpage" id="31"><div class="centered">

</p><p class="paragraph">Now let’s look at the number system that most computers use, the binary system. Just as the decimal
system, had the nines (R’s-1) and tens (R’s) complement, the binary system has two types of complement
methods. These two types are the ones (R’s-1) complement and the twos (R’s) complement. The binary
system R’s-1 complement is the difference between the binary number and all 1s. The R’s complement is
the difference between the binary number and the next higher power of 2.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s look at a quick and easy way to form the R’s-1 complement. To do this, change each 1 in the
original number to 0 and each 0 in the original number to 1 as has been done in the example below.
</p><p class="pagenumber">10110112
</p><h3 class="subsection">1001002 R’s-1 complement
</h3><p class="paragraph">There are two methods of achieving the R’s complement. In the first method we perform the R’s-1
complement and then add 1. This is much easier than subtracting the original number from the next higher
power of 2. If you had subtracted, you would have had to borrow.
</p><p class="paragraph">Saying it another way, to reach the R’s complement of any binary number, change all 1s to 0s and all
0s to 1s, and then add 1.
</p><p class="paragraph">As an example let’s determine the R’s complement of 101011012:
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The second method of obtaining the R’s complement will be demonstrated on the binary number
001011011002.

</p><p class="paragraph">Step 4—Remember to discard any carry beyond the size of the original number. Our original
problem had four digits, so we discard the carry that expanded the difference to five digits.
This carry we disregard is significant to the computer. It indicates that the difference is
positive. Because we have a carry, we can read the difference directly without any further
computations. Let's check our answer:
</p><p class="paragraph">If we do not have a carry, it indicates the difference is a negative number. In that case, the difference
must be R's complemented to produce the correct answer.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's look at an example that will explain this for you.
</p><p class="paragraph">Subtract 910 from 510 (10012 from 01012):

negative. With no carry, we must R's complement the difference in step 3. We will then
have arrived at the answer (difference) to our original problem. Let's do this R's
complement step and then check our answer:

</h3><p class="paragraph">The addition of hex numbers may seem intimidating at first glance, but it is no different than
addition in any other number system. The same rules apply. Certain combinations of symbols produce a
carry while others do not. Some numerals combine to produce a sum represented by a letter. After a little
practice you will be as confident adding hex numbers as you are adding decimal numbers.
</p><p class="paragraph">Study the hex addition table in table 1-6. Using the table, add 7 and 7. Locate the number 7 in both
columns X and Y. The point in area Z where these two columns intersect is the sum; in this case 7 + 7 =
E. As long as the sum of two numbers is 1510 or less, only one symbol is used for the sum. A carry will be
produced when the sum of two numbers is 1610 or greater, as in the following examples:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Subtraction of Hex Numbers
</h3><p class="paragraph">The subtraction of hex numbers looks more difficult than it really is. In the preceding sections you
learned all the rules for subtraction. Now you need only to apply those rules to a new number system. The
symbols may be different and the amount of the borrow is different, but the rules remain the same.
</p><p class="paragraph">Use the hex addition table (table 1-6) to follow the solution of the following problems:
</p><p class="paragraph">Working from left to right, first locate the subtrahend (2) in column Y. Follow this line across area Z
until you reach C. The difference is located in column X directly above the C ¾ in this case A. Use this
same procedure to reach the solution:
</p><p class="paragraph">Now examine the following solutions:
</p><p class="paragraph">In the previous example, when F was subtracted from 1E, a borrow was used. Since you cannot
subtract F from E and have a positive difference, a borrow of 1016 was taken from the next higher value
column. The borrow was added to E, and the higher value column was reduced by 1.
</p><p class="paragraph">The following example shows the use of the borrow in a more difficult problem:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In this first step, B cannot be subtracted from 7, so you take a borrow of 1016 from the next higher
value column. Add the borrow to the 7 in the minuend; then subtract (1716 minus B16 equals C16). Reduce
the number from which the borrow was taken (3) by 1.
</p><p class="paragraph">To subtract 416 from 216 also requires a borrow, as shown below:
</p><p class="paragraph">Borrow 1016 from the A and reduce the minuend by 1. Add the borrow to the 2 and subtract 416 from
1216. The difference is E.
</p><p class="paragraph">When solved the problem looks like this:
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember that the borrow is 1016 not 1010.
</p><p class="paragraph">There may be times when you need to borrow from a column that has a 0 in the minuend. In that
case, you borrow from the next highest value column, which will provide you with a value in the 0
column that you can borrow from.
</p><p class="paragraph">To subtract A from 7, you must borrow. To borrow you must first borrow from the 2. The 0 becomes
1016, which can give up a borrow. Reduce the 1016 by 1 to provide a borrow for the 7. Reducing 1016 by 1
equals F. Subtracting A16 from 1716 gives you D16. Bring down the 1 and F for a difference of 1FD16.

common are 4-, 8-, and 16-bit words. Quite often, these words must use binary-coded decimal inputs.
</p><p class="paragraph">Binary-coded decimal, or BCD, is a method of using binary digits to represent the decimal digits 0
through 9. A decimal digit is represented by four binary digits, as shown below:
</p><p class="paragraph">You should note in the table above that the BCD coding is the binary equivalent of the decimal digit.

The number systems that were dealt with are used extensively in the microprocessor and computer fields.
The following is a summary of the emphasized terms and points found in the "Number Systems" chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">The UNIT represents a single object.
A NUMBER is a symbol used to represent one or more units.
</p><p class="paragraph">The RADIX is the base of a positional number system. It is equal to the number of symbols used in
that number system.
</p><p class="paragraph">A POSITIONAL NOTATION is a system in which the value or magnitude of a number is defined
not only by its digits or symbol value, but also by its position. Each position represents a power of the
radix, or base, and is ranked in ascending or descending order.
</p><p class="paragraph">The MOST SIGNIFICANT DIGIT (MSD) is a digit within a number (whole or fractional) that has
the largest effect (weighing power) on that number.
</p><p class="paragraph">The LEAST SIGNIFICANT DIGIT (LSD) is a digit within a number (whole or fractional) that has
the least effect (weighting power) on that number.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM is a base 2 system. The symbols 1 and 0 can be used to
represent the state of electrical/electronic devices. A binary 1 may indicate the device is active; a 0 may
indicate the device is inactive.
</p><p class="paragraph">The OCTAL NUMBER SYSTEM is a base 8 system and is quite useful as a tool in the conversion
of binary numbers. This system works because 8 is an integral power of 2; that is, 23 = 8. The use of octal
numbers reduces the number of digits required to represent the binary equivalent of a decimal number.
</p><p class="paragraph">The HEX NUMBER SYSTEM is a base 16 system and is sometimes used in computer systems. A
binary number can be converted directly to a base 16 number if the binary number is first broken into
groups of four digits.
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic rules of ADDITION apply to each of the number systems. Each system becomes unique
when carries are produced.
</p><p class="paragraph">SUBTRACTION in each system is based on certain rules of that number system. The borrow varies
in magnitude according to the number system in use. In most computers, subtraction is accomplished by
using the complement (R’s or R’s-1) of the subtrahend and adding it to the minuend.
</p><p class="paragraph">To CONVERT A WHOLE BASE 10 NUMBER to another system, divide the decimal number by
the base of the number system to which you are converting. Continue dividing the quotient of the
previous division until it can no longer be done. Extract the remainders ¾ the remainder from the first
computation will yield the LSD; the last will provide the MSD.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-2-1-">INTRODUCTION
</h2><p class="paragraph">In chapter 1 you learned that the two digits of the binary number system can be represented by the
state or condition of electrical or electronic devices. A binary 1 can be represented by a switch that is
closed, a lamp that is lit, or a transistor that is conducting. Conversely, a binary 0 would be represented by
the same devices in the opposite state: the switch open, the lamp off, or the transistor in cut-off.
</p><p class="paragraph">In this chapter you will study the four basic logic gates that make up the foundation for digital
equipment. You will see the types of logic that are used in equipment to accomplish the desired results.
This chapter includes an introduction to Boolean algebra, the logic mathematics system used with digital
equipment. Certain Boolean expressions are used in explanation of the basic logic gates, and their
expressions will be used as each logic gate is introduced.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMPUTER-LOGIC-2-1-">COMPUTER LOGIC

logical conclusion based on known information.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-GENERAL-LOGIC-2-2-">GENERAL LOGIC
</h2><p class="paragraph">Consider the following example: If it is true that all Navy ships are gray and the USS Lincoln is a
Navy ship, then you would reach the logical conclusion that the USS Lincoln is gray.
</p><p class="paragraph">To reach a logical conclusion, you must assume the qualifying statement is a condition of truth. For
each statement there is also a corresponding false condition. The statement "USS Lincoln is a Navy ship"
is true; therefore, the statement "USS Lincoln is not a Navy ship" is false. There are no in-between
conditions.
</p><p class="paragraph">Computers operate on the principle of logic and use the TRUE and FALSE logic conditions of a
logical statement to make a programmed decision.
</p><p class="paragraph">The conditions of a statement can be represented by symbols (variables); for instance, the statement
"Today is payday" might be represented by the symbol P. If today actually is payday, then P is TRUE. If
today is not payday, then P is FALSE. As you can see, a statement has two conditions. In computers,
these two conditions are represented by electronic circuits operating in two LOGIC STATES. These
logic states are 0 (zero) and 1 (one). Respectively, 0 and 1 represent the FALSE and TRUE conditions of
a statement.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the TRUE and FALSE conditions are converted to electrical signals, they are referred to as
LOGIC LEVELS called HIGH and LOW. The 1 state might be represented by the presence of an
electrical signal (HIGH), while the 0 state might be represented by the absence of an electrical signal
(LOW).
</p><p class="paragraph">If the statement "Today is payday" is FALSE, then the statement "Today is NOT payday" must be
TRUE. This is called the COMPLEMENT of the original statement. In the case of computer math,
complement is defined as the opposite or negative form of the original statement or variable. If today
were payday, then the statement "Today is not payday" would be FALSE. The complement is shown by
placing a bar, or VINCULUM, over the statement symbol (in this case, P ). This variable is spoken as
NOT P. Table 2-1 shows this concept and the relationship with logic states and logic levels.

AB C D is spoken "A AND B AND NOT C AND D."
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-POSITIVE-AND-NEGATIVE-LOGIC-2-3-">POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE LOGIC
</h2><p class="paragraph">To this point, we have been dealing with one type of  LOGIC POLARITY, positive. Let’s further
define logic polarity and expand to cover in more detail the differences between positive and negative
logic.
</p><p class="paragraph">Logic polarity is the type of voltage used to represent the logic 1 state of a statement. We have
determined that the two logic states can be represented by electrical signals. Any two distinct voltages
may be used. For instance, a positive voltage can represent the 1 state, and a negative voltage can
represent the 0 state. The opposite is also true.
</p><p class="paragraph">Logic circuits are generally divided into two broad classes according to their polarity ¾ positive
logic and negative logic. The voltage levels used and a statement indicating the use of positive or negative
logic will usually be specified on logic diagrams supplied by manufacturers.
</p><p class="paragraph">In practice, many variations of logic polarity are used; for example, from a high-positive to a low-
positive voltage, or from positive to ground; or from a high-negative to a low-negative voltage, or from
negative to ground. A brief discussion of the two general classes of logic polarity is presented in the
following paragraphs.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Positive Logic
</h3><p class="paragraph">Positive logic is defined as follows: If the signal that activates the circuit (the 1 state) has a voltage
level that is more POSITIVE than the 0 state, then the logic polarity is considered to be POSITIVE. Table
2-2 shows the manner in which positive logic may be used.
</p><p class="paragraph">Table 2-2. —Examples of Positive Logic
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see, in positive logic the 1 state is at a more positive voltage level than the 0 state.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Negative Logic
</h3><p class="paragraph">As you might suspect, negative logic is the opposite of positive logic and is defined as follows: If the
signal that activates the circuit (the 1 state) has a voltage level that is more NEGATIVE than the 0 state,
then the logic polarity is considered to be NEGATIVE. Table 2-3 shows the manner in which negative
logic may be used.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Table 2-3.—Examples of Negative Logic
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: The logic level LOW now represents the 1 state. This is because the 1 state voltage is more
negative than the 0 state.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the examples shown for negative logic, you notice that the voltage for the logic 1 state is more
negative with respect to the logic 0 state voltage. This holds true in example 1 where both voltages are
positive. In this case, it may be easier for you to think of the TRUE condition as being less positive than
the FALSE condition. Either way, the end result is negative logic.
</p><p class="paragraph">The use of positive or negative logic for digital equipment is a choice to be made by design
engineers. The difficulty for the technician in this area is limited to understanding the type of logic being
used and keeping it in mind when troubleshooting.
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE:
</p><p class="paragraph">UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, THE REMAINDER OF THIS BOOK WILL DEAL
ONLY WITH POSITIVE LOGIC.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LOGIC-INPUTS-AND-OUTPUTS-2-4-">LOGIC INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">As you study logic circuits, you will see a variety of symbols (variables) used to represent the inputs
and outputs. The purpose of these symbols is to let you know what inputs are required for the desired
output.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the symbol A is shown as an input to a logic device, then the logic level that represents A must be
HIGH to activate the logic device. That is, it must satisfy the input requirements of the logic device
before the logic device will issue the TRUE output.
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at view A of figure 2-1. The symbol X represents the input. As long as the switch is open, the
lamp is not lit. The open switch represents the logic 0 state of variable X.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Closing the switch (view B), represents the logic 1 state of X. Closing the switch completes the
circuit causing the lamp to light. The 1 state of X satisfied the input requirement and the circuit therefore
produced the desired output (logic HIGH); current was applied to the lamp causing it to light.
</p><p class="paragraph">If you consider the lamp as the output of a logic device, then the same conditions exist. The TRUE
(1 state) output of the logic device is to have the lamp lit. If the lamp is not lit, then the output of the logic
device is FALSE (0 state).
</p><p class="paragraph">As you study logic circuits, it is important that you remember the state (1 or 0) of the inputs and
outputs.
</p><p class="paragraph">So far in this chapter, we have discussed the two conditions of logical statements, the logic states
representing these two conditions, logic levels and associated electrical signals and positive and negative
logic. We are now ready to proceed with individual logic device operations. These make up the majority
of computer circuitry.
</p><p class="paragraph">As each of the logic devices are presented, a chart called a TRUTH TABLE will be used to illustrate
all possible input and corresponding output combinations. Truth Tables are particularly helpful in
understanding a logic device and for showing the differences between devices.
</p><p class="paragraph">The logic operations you will study in this chapter are the AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR. The
devices that accomplish these operations are called logic gates, or more informally, gates. These gates are
the foundation for all digital equipment. They are the "decision-making" circuits of computers and other
types of digital equipment. By making decisions, we mean that certain conditions must exist to produce
the desired output.
</p><p class="paragraph">In studying each gate, we will introduce various mathematical SYMBOLS known as BOOLEAN
ALGEBRA expressions. These expressions are nothing more than descriptions of the input requirements
necessary to activate the circuit and the resultant circuit output.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

output to be TRUE.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LOGIC-SYMBOL-2-6-">LOGIC SYMBOL
</h2><p class="paragraph">The standard symbol for the AND gate is shown in figure 2-2. Variations of this standard symbol
may be encountered. These variations become necessary to illustrate that an AND gate may have more
than one input.
</p><p class="paragraph">If we apply two variables, A and B, to the inputs of the AND gate, then both A and B would have to
be TRUE at the same time to produce the desired TRUE output. . The symbol f designates the output
function. The Boolean expression for this operation is f = A·B or f = AB. The expression is spoken, "f =
A AND B." The dot, or lack of, indicates the AND function.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-AND-GATE-OPERATION-2-6-">AND GATE OPERATION
</h2><p class="paragraph">We can demonstrate the operation of the AND gate with a simple circuit that has two switches in
series as shown in figure 2-3. You can see that both switches would have to be closed at the same time to
light the lamp (view A). Any other combination of switch positions (view B) would result in an open

The latter is a deviation of the Truth Table. It uses the HIGH and LOW logic levels to depict the gate’s
inputs and resultant output combinations rather than the 1 and 0 logic states. By comparing the inputs and
outputs of the two tables, you see how one can easily be converted to the other (remember, 1 = HIGH and
0 = LOW). The Table of Combinations is shown here only to familiarize you with its existence, it will not
be seen again in this book. As we mentioned earlier, the Truth Table is a chart that shows all possible
combinations of inputs and the resulting outputs. Compare the AND gate Truth Table (figure 2-5) with
the input signals shown in figure 2-4.

that the two-input AND gate has four possible combinations, with only one of those combinations
providing a HIGH output. An AND gate with three inputs has eight possible combinations, again with
only one combination providing a HIGH output. Make sure you include all possible combinations. To
check if you have all combinations, raise 2 to the power equal to the number of input variables. This will
give you the total number of possible combinations. For example:

Don’t be confused if the complement of a variable is used as an input. When a complement is indicated as
an input to an AND gate, it must also be HIGH to satisfy the input requirements of the gate. The Boolean
expression for the output is formulated based on the TRUE inputs that give a TRUE output. Here is an
adage that might help you better understand the AND gate:
</p><p class="paragraph">In order to produce a 1 output, all the inputs must be 1. If any or all of the inputs is/are 0, then the
output will be 0.
</p><p class="paragraph">Referring to the following examples should help you cement this concept in your mind. Remember,
the inputs, whether the original variable or the complement must be high in order for the output to be
high. The three examples given are all AND gates with two inputs. Keep in mind the Boolean expression
for the output is the result of all the inputs being HIGH.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

gate, but many combinations of gates. At first it may seem confusing and complex. If you interpret one
gate at a time, you can work your way through any network. In this section, we will analyze several
combinations of gates and then provide you with some practice problems.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-23 (view A) shows a simple combination of AND gates. The outputs of gates 1 and 2 are

expression is spoken, "quantity R OR S AND quantity T OR V." The parentheses are used to separate the
input terms and to indicate the AND function. Without the parentheses the output expression would read
R+ST+V, which is representative of the circuit in view C. As you can see, this is not the same circuit as
the one depicted in view B. It is very important that the Boolean expressions be written and spoken
correctly.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Boolean logic, or Boolean algebra as it is called today, was developed by an English mathematician,
George Boole, in the 19th century. He based his concepts on the assumption that most quantities have two
possible conditions ¾ TRUE and FALSE. This is the same theory you were introduced to at the
beginning of this chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">Throughout our discussions of fundamental logic gates, we have mentioned Boolean expressions. A
Boolean expression is nothing more than a description of the input conditions necessary to get the desired
output. These expressions are based on Boole’s laws and theorems.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Boolean algebra is used primarily by design engineers. Using this system, they are able to arrange
logic gates to accomplish desired tasks. Boolean algebra also enables the engineers to achieve the desired
output by using the fewest number of logic gates. Since space, weight, and cost are important factors in
the design of equipment, you would usually want to use as few parts as possible.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

classified according to their ability to accept and combine the digits. In this section we will discuss
quarter adders, half adders, and full adders.
</p><p class="paragraph">QUARTER ADDER
A quarter adder is a circuit that can add two binary digits but will not produce a carry. This circuit
</p><p class="paragraph">will produce the following results:
</p><h3 class="subsection">0 plus 0 = 0

</p><p class="paragraph">You will notice that the output produced is the same as the output for the Truth Table of an X-OR.
Therefore, an X-OR gate can be used as a quarter adder.
</p><p class="paragraph">The combination of gates in figure 3-6 will also produce the desired results. When A and B are both
LOW (0), the output of each AND gate is LOW (0); therefore, the output of the OR gate is LOW (0).
When A is HIGH and B is LOW, then B  is HIGH and AND gate 1 produces a HIGH output, resulting in
a sum of 1 at gate 3. With A LOW and B HIGH, gate 2 output is HIGH, and the sum is 1. When both A
and B are HIGH, neither AND gate has an output, and the output of gate 3 is LOW (0); no carry is
produced.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HALF-ADDER-3-6-">HALF ADDER
</h2><p class="paragraph">A half adder is designed to combine two binary digits and produce a carry.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-7 shows two ways of constructing a half adder. An AND gate is added in parallel to the
quarter adder to generate the carry. The SUM column of the Truth Table represents the output of the
quarter adder, and the CARRY column represents the output of the AND gate.

</p><p class="paragraph">We have seen that the output of the quarter adder is HIGH when either input, but not both, is HIGH.
It is only when both inputs are HIGH that the AND gate is activated and a carry is produced. The largest
sum that can be obtained from a half adder is 102 (12 plus 12).
FULL ADDER
</p><p class="paragraph">The full adder becomes necessary when a carry input must be added to the two binary digits to
obtain the correct sum. A half adder has no input for carries from previous circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">One method of constructing a full adder is to use two half adders and an OR gate as shown in figure
3-8. The inputs A and B are applied to gates 1 and 2. These make up one half adder. The sum output of
this half adder and the carry-from a previous circuit become the inputs to the second half adder. The carry
from each half adder is applied to gate 5 to produce the carry-out for the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now let’s add a series of numbers and see how the circuit operates.
</p><p class="paragraph">First, let’s add 1 and 0. When either A or B is HIGH, gate 1 has an output. This output is applied to
gates 3 and 4. Since the carry-in is 0, only gate 3 will produce an output. The sum of 12 and 0 is 12.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now let’s add 12 and 12. If A and B are both HIGH, the output of gate 1 is LOW. When the carry-in
is 0 (LOW), the output of gate 3 is LOW. Gate 2 produces an output that is applied to gate 5, which
produces the carry-out. The sum of 12 and 12 is 102, just as it was for the half adder.
</p><p class="paragraph">When A and B are both LOW and the carry-in is 1, only gate 3 has an output and produces a sum of
12 with no carry-out.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, let’s add A or B and a carry-in. For example, let’s assume that A is HIGH and B is LOW. With
these conditions, gate 1 will have an output. This output and the carry-in applied to gates 3 and 4 will
produce a sum out of 0 and a carry of 1. This carry from gate 4 will cause gate 5 to produce a carry-out.
The sum of A and a carry (12 plus 12) is 102.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

and B. When both are HIGH, the output of gate 1 is LOW, and the output of gate 2 is HIGH, giving us a
carry-out at gate 5. The carry-in produces a 1 output at gate 3, giving us a sum of 1. The output of the full
adder is 112. The sum of 12 plus 12 plus 12 is 112.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PARALLEL-ADDERS-3-8-">PARALLEL ADDERS
</h2><p class="paragraph">The adders discussed in the previous section have been limited to adding single-digit binary numbers
and carries. The largest sum that can be obtained using a full adder is 112.
</p><p class="paragraph">Parallel adders let us add multiple-digit numbers. If we place full adders in parallel, we can add two-
or four-digit numbers or any other size desired.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-9 uses STANDARD SYMBOLS to show a parallel adder capable of adding two, two-digit
binary numbers. In previous discussions we have depicted circuits with individual logic gates shown.
Standard symbols (blocks) allow us to analyze circuits with inputs and outputs only. One standard symbol
may actually contain many and various types of gates and circuits. The addend would be input on the A
inputs (A2 = MSD, A1 = LSD), and the augend input on the B inputs (B2 = MSD, B1  = LSD). For this
explanation we will assume there is no input to C0 (carry from a previous circuit).
</p><p class="paragraph">Now let’s add some two-digit numbers. To add 102 (addend) and 012 (augend), assume there are
numbers at the appropriate inputs. The addend inputs will be 1 on A2 and 0 on A1. The augend inputs will
be 0 on B2 and 1 on B1. Working from right to left, as we do in normal addition, let’s calculate the outputs
of each full adder.
</p><p class="paragraph">With A1 at 0 and B1 at 1, the output of adder 1 will be a sum (S1) of 1 with no carry (C1). Since A2 is
1 and B2 is 0, we have a sum (S2) of 1 with no carry (C2) from adder 1. To determine the sum, read the
outputs (C2, S 2, and S1) from left to right. In this case, C2 = 0, S2 = 1, and S1 = 1. The sum, then, of 102
and 012 is 0112  or 112.
</p><p class="paragraph">To add 112 and 012, assume one number is applied to A1 and A2, and the other to B1 and B2, as
shown in figure 3-10. Adder 1 produces a sum (S1) of 0 and a carry (C1) of 1. Adder 2 gives us a sum (S2)</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

11
</p><p class="paragraph"> 2 and 112.
</p><p class="paragraph">First, apply the addend and augend to the A and B inputs. Calculate the output of each full adder
beginning with full adder 1. With A1 and B1 at 1, S1 is 0 and C1 is 1. Since all three inputs (A2, B2, and C1)
to full adder 2 are 1, the output will be 1 at S2 and 1 at C2. The output of the circuit, as you read left to
right, is 1102, the sum of 112 and 112.

SUBTRACTION
</p><p class="paragraph">Subtraction is accomplished in computers by the R’s complement and add method. This is the same
method you used in chapter 1 to subtract binary numbers.
</p><p class="paragraph">R’s complement subtraction allows us to use fewer circuits than would be required for separate add
and subtract functions. Adding X-OR gates to full adders, as shown in figure 3-11, enables the circuit to
perform R’s complement subtraction as well as addition.
</p><p class="paragraph">To add two numbers using this circuit, the addend and augend are applied to the A and B inputs. The
B inputs are applied to one input of the X-OR gates. A control signal is applied to the other input of the
X-OR gates. When the control signal is LOW, the circuit will add; and when it is HIGH, the circuit will
subtract.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the add mode, the outputs of the X-OR gates will be the same as the B inputs. Addition takes
place in the same manner as described in parallel addition.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before we attempt to show subtraction, let’s review R’s complement subtraction. To subtract 102
from 112, write down the minuend (112). Perform the R’s complement on the subtrahend. Now add the
minuend and the complemented subtrahend.

</p><p class="paragraph">Now let’s subtract 102 from 112 using the adder/subtracter circuit. The minuend (112) is input on the
A terminals, and the subtrahend (102) is input on the B terminals. In the subtract mode, a 1 from the
control circuit is input to each of the X-OR gates and to the C0 carry input. By applying a 1 to each of the
X-OR gates, you find the output will be the complement of the subtrahend input at B1 and B2. Since B1 is
a 0, the output of X-OR 1 will be 1. The input B2 to X-OR 2 will be inverted to a 0. The HIGH input to C0
acts as a carry from a previous circuit. The combination of the X-OR gates and the HIGH at C0 produces
the R’s complement of the subtrahend. The full adders add the minuend and the R’s complement of the
subtrahend and produce the difference. The output of C2 is not used. The outputs of S2 and S1 are 0 and 1,
respectively, indicating a difference of 012. Therefore, 112 minus 102 equals 012.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Flip-flops (FFs) are devices used in the digital field for a variety of purposes. When properly
connected, flip-flops may be used to store data temporarily, to multiply or divide, to count operations, or
to receive and transfer information.
</p><p class="paragraph">Flip-flops are bistable multivibrators. The types used in digital equipment are identified by the
inputs. They may have from two up to five inputs depending on the type. They are all common in one
respect. They have two, and only two, distinct output states. The outputs are normally labeled Q and Q
and should always be complementary. When Q = 1, then Q  = 0 and vice versa.
</p><p class="paragraph">In this section we will discuss four types of FFs that are common to digital equipment. They are the
R-S, D, T, and J-K FFs.

store one binary digit, either a 1 or a 0. Storing a four-digit binary number would require four R-S FFs.
</p><p class="paragraph">The standard symbol for the R-S FF is shown in figure 3-12, view A. The name is derived from the
inputs, R for reset and S for set. It is often referred to as an R-S LATCH. The outputs Q and Q  are
complements, as mentioned earlier.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The R-S FF has two output conditions. When the Q output is HIGH and Q  is LOW, the FF is set.
When Q is LOW and Q  is HIGH, the FF is reset. When the R and S inputs are both LOW, the Q and Q
outputs will both be HIGH. When this condition exists, the FF is considered to be JAMMED and the
outputs cannot be used. The jammed condition is corrected when either S or R goes HIGH.
</p><p class="paragraph">To set the flip-flop requires a HIGH on the S input and a LOW on the R input. To reset, the opposite
is required; S input LOW and R input HIGH. When both R and S are HIGH, the FF will hold or "latch"
the condition that existed before both inputs went HIGH.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because the S input of this FF requires a logic LOW to set, a more easily understood symbol is
shown in figure 3-12, view B. Refer to this view while reading the following paragraph.
</p><p class="paragraph">In our description of R-S FF operation, let’s assume that the signals applied to the S and R inputs are
the LSDs of two different binary numbers. Let’s also assume that these two binary numbers represent the
speed and range of a target ship. The LSDs will be called SB0 (Speed Bit 0) and RB0 (Range Bit 0) and
will be applied to the S and R inputs respectively. Refer to figure 3-12, view B, and figure 3-13. At time
T0, both SB0 and RB0 are HIGH, as a result, both Q and Q  are HIGH. This is the jammed state and as
mentioned earlier, cannot be used in logic circuitry. At T1, SB0 goes LOW and RB0 remains HIGH; Q
goes LOW and Q  remains HIGH; the FF is reset. At T2 RB0 goes LOW and SB0 remains LOW; the FF
is latched in the reset condition. At T3, SB0 goes HIGH and RB0 remains LOW; the FF sets. At T4 SB0
goes LOW and RB0 goes HIGH; the FF resets. When SB0 and RB0 input conditions reverse at T5, the FF
sets. The circuit is put in the latch condition at T6 when SB0 goes LOW. Notice that the output changes
states ONLY when the inputs are in opposite states.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

from chapter 2 that the output of an inverter is the complement of the input. In this case, since SB0 is
HIGH, SBO  will be LOW. The LOW input to NAND gate 1 causes the Q output to go HIGH. This
HIGH Q output is also fed to the input of NAND gate 2. The other input to NAND gate 2, RBO, is
HIGH. With both inputs to gate 2 HIGH, the output goes LOW. The LOW Q  output is also fed to NAND
gate 1 to be used as the "latch" signal. If SB0 goes LOW while this condition exists, there will be no
change to the outputs because the FF would be in the latched condition; both SB0 and RB0 LOW.
</p><p class="paragraph">When RB0 is HIGH and SB0 is LOW, RBO being LOW drives the output, Q , to a HIGH
condition. The HIGH Q  and HIGH SBO  inputs to gate 1 cause the output, Q, to go LOW. This LOW is

assume an initial condition (T0) of Q being LOW and Q  being HIGH. At T1, the toggle changes from a
LOW to a HIGH and the device changes state; Q goes HIGH and Q  goes LOW. The outputs remain the
same at T2 since the device is switched only by a LOW-to-HIGH transition. At T3, when the toggle goes
HIGH, Q goes LOW and Q  goes HIGH; they remain that way until T5.
</p><p class="paragraph">Between T1 and T5, two complete cycles of T occur. During the same time period, only one cycle is
observed for Q or Q . Since the output cycle is one-half the input cycle, this device can be used to divide

a timing pulse generated by the equipment to control operations. The D FF is used to store data at a
predetermined time and hold it until it is needed. This circuit is sometimes called a delay FF. In other
words, the data input is delayed up to one clock pulse before it is seen in the output.

</p><p class="paragraph">Depending on the circuit design, the clock (CLK) can be a square wave, a constant frequency, or
asymmetrical pulses. In this example the clock (CLK) input will be a constant input at a given frequency.
This frequency is determined by the control unit of the equipment. The data (D) input will be present
when there is a need to store information. Notice in the Truth Table that output Q reflects the D input only
when the clock transitions from 0 to 1 (LOW to HIGH).
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s assume that at T0, CLK is 0, D is 1, and Q is 0. Input D remains at 1 for approximately 2 1/2
clock pulses. At T1, when the clock goes to 1, Q also goes to 1 and remains at 1 even though D goes to 0
between T2 and T3. At T3, the positive-going pulse of the clock causes Q to go to 0, reflecting the
condition of D. The positive-going clock pulse at T5 causes no change in the output because D is still
LOW. Between T5 and T6, D goes HIGH, but Q remains LOW until T7 when the clock goes HIGH.
</p><p class="paragraph">The key to understanding the output of the D FF is to remember that the data (D) input is seen in the
output only after the clock has gone HIGH.
</p><p class="paragraph">You may see D FF symbols with two additional inputs ¾ CLR (clear) and PR (preset). These inputs
are used to set the start condition of the FF ¾ CLR sets Q to 0; PR sets Q to 1. Figure 3-17 shows the
standard symbol with the CLR and PR inputs. Since these inputs are preceded by inverters (part of the
FF), a LOW-going signal is necessary to activate the FF. These signals (CLR and PR) override any

LOW. The CLK, J, and K inputs are irrelevant. At this point the FF is jammed, and both Q and Q  are
HIGH. As with the R-S FF, this state cannot be used.
</p><p class="paragraph">At T1, PS remains LOW while CLR goes HIGH. The Q output remains HIGH and Q  goes LOW.
The FF is in the PRESET condition (line 2 of the Truth Table).
</p><p class="paragraph">At T2, PS goes HIGH, CLR goes LOW, Q goes LOW, and Q  goes HIGH. At this point the FF is
CLEARED (line 3 of the Truth Table). The condition of the CLK, J, and K inputs have no effect on the
PS and CLR actions since these inputs override the other inputs. Starting at T3, PS and CLR will be held
at HIGHs so as not to override the other actions of the FF. Using the PS and CLR inputs only, the circuit
will function as an R-S FF.
</p><p class="paragraph">Between T2 and T3, the CLK input is applied to the device. Since the CLK input has an inverter, all
actions will take place on the negative-going transition of the clock pulse.
</p><p class="paragraph">Line 4 of the Truth Table shows both PS and CLR HIGH, a negative-going CLK, and J and K at 0,

condition of the output. In this case the FF is reset. If the circuit were set when these inputs occurred, it
would remain set.
</p><p class="paragraph">At time T5, we have a negative-going clock pulse and a HIGH on the J input. This causes the circuit

</p><p class="paragraph">At T6, J goes LOW, K goes HIGH, and the clock is in a positive-going transition. There is no change
in the output because all actions take place on the negative clock transition.

goes HIGH (line 6).

</h2><p class="paragraph">Clocks and counters are found in all types of digital equipment. Although they provide different
functions, they are all constructed of circuits with which you are familiar. By changing the way the
circuits are interconnected, we can build timing circuits, multipliers and dividers, and storage units. In this
section we will discuss the purpose, construction, and operation of these important digital circuits.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CLOCKS-3-21-">CLOCKS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Clocks have been mentioned in the preceding section with regard to their action with FFs. You will
recall that the clock is a timing signal generated by the equipment to control operations. This control
feature is demonstrated in both the D and J-K FFs. Remember that the clock output had to be in a certain
condition for the FFs to perform their functions.
</p><p class="paragraph">The simplest form of a clock is the astable or free-running multivibrator. A schematic diagram of a
typical free-running multivibrator is shown in figure 3-20 along with its output waveforms. This
multivibrator circuit is called free running because it alternates between two different output voltages
during the time it is active. Outputs 1 and 2 will be equal and opposite since Q1 and Q2 conduct
alternately. The frequency of the outputs may be altered within certain limits by varying the values of
R2C1 and R3C2. You may want to review the operation of the astable multivibrator in NEETS, Module 9,
Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits. Although the astable multivibrator circuit
seems to produce a good, balanced square wave, it lacks the frequency stability necessary for some types
of equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">The frequency stability of the astable multivibrator can be increased by applying a trigger pulse to
the circuit. The frequency of the trigger must be higher than the free-running frequency of the
multivibrator. The output frequency will match the trigger frequency and produce a more stable output.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Another method of producing a stable clock pulse is to use a triggered monostable or one-shot
multivibrator. You will recall from NEETS, Module 9, that a one-shot multivibrator has one stable state
and will only change states when acted on by an outside source (the trigger). A block diagram of a
monostable multivibrator with input and output signals is shown in figure 3-21. The duration of the output
pulse is dependent on the charge time of an RC network in the multivibrator. Each trigger input results in
a complete cycle in the output, as shown in figure 3-21. Trigger pulses are supplied by an oscillator.
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuits described previously are very simple clocks. However, as the complexity of the system
increases, so do the timing requirements. Complex systems have multiphase clocks to control a variety of
operations. Multiphase clocks allow functions involving more than one operation to be completed during
a single clock cycle. They also permit an operation to extend over more than one clock cycle.
</p><p class="paragraph">A block diagram of a two-phase clock system is shown in figure 3-22, view A. The astable
multivibrator provides the basic timing for the circuit, while the one-shot multivibrators are used to shape
the pulses. Outputs Q and Q  are input to one-shot multivibrators 1 and 2, respectively. The resulting
outputs are in phase with the inputs, but the duration of the pulse is greatly reduced as shown in view B.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A counter is simply a device that counts. Counters may be used to count operations, quantities, or
periods of time. They may also be used for dividing frequencies, for addressing information in storage, or
for temporary storage.
</p><p class="paragraph">Counters are a series of FFs wired together to perform the type of counting desired. They will count
up or down by ones, twos, or more.
</p><p class="paragraph">The total number of counts or stable states a counter can indicate is called MODULUS. For instance,
the modulus of a four-stage counter would be 1610, since it is capable of indicating 00002 to 11112. The
term modulo is used to describe the count capability of counters; that is, modulo-16 for a four-stage
binary counter, modulo-11 for a decade counter, modulo-8 for a three-stage binary counter, and so forth.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Ripple Counters
</h3><p class="paragraph">Ripple counters are so named because the count is like a chain reaction that ripples through the
counter because of the time involved. This effect will become more evident with the explanation of the
following circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-23, view A, shows a basic four-stage, or modulo-16, ripple counter. The inputs and outputs
are shown in view B. The four J-K FFs are connected to perform a toggle function; which, you will recall,

</p><p class="paragraph">Assume that A, B, C, and D are lamps and that all the FFs are reset. The lamps will all be out, and
the count indicated will be 00002. The negative-going pulse of clock pulse 1 causes FF1 to set. This lights
lamp A, and we have a count of 00012. The negative-going pulse of clock pulse 2 toggles FF1, causing it
to reset. This negative-going input to FF2 causes it to set and causes B to light. The count after two clock
pulses is 00102, or 210. Clock pulse 3 causes FF1 to set and lights lamp A. The setting of FF1 does not
affect FF2, and lamp B stays lit. After three clock pulses, the indicated count is 00112.
</p><p class="paragraph">Clock pulse 4 causes FF1 to reset, which causes FF2 to reset, which causes FF3 to set, giving us a
count of 01002. This step shows the ripple effect.
</p><p class="paragraph">This setting and resetting of the FFs will continue until all the FFs are set and all the lamps are lit. At
that time the count will be 11112 or 1510. Clock pulse 16 will cause FF1 to reset and lamp A to go out.
This will cause FF2 through FF4 to reset, in order, and will extinguish lamps B, C, and D. The counter
would then start at 00012 on clock pulse 17. To display a count of 1610 or 100002, we would need to add
another FF.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ripple counter is also called an ASYNCHRONOUS counter. Asynchronous means that the
events (setting and resetting of FFs) occur one after the other rather than all at once. Because the ripple
count is asynchronous, it can produce erroneous indications when the clock speed is high. A high-speed
clock can cause the lower stage FFs to change state before the upper stages have reacted to the previous
clock pulse. The errors are produced by the FFs’ inability to keep up with the clock.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">High-frequency operations require that all the FFs of a counter be triggered at the same time to
prevent errors. We use a SYNCHRONOUS counter for this type of operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">The synchronous counter is similar to a ripple counter with two exceptions: The clock pulses are
applied to each FF, and additional gates are added to ensure that the FFs toggle in the proper sequence.
</p><p class="paragraph">A logic diagram of a three-state (modulo-8) synchronous counter is shown in figure 3-24, view A.
The clock input is wired to each of the FFs to prevent possible errors in the count. A HIGH is wired to the
J and K inputs of FF1 to make the FF toggle. The output of FF1 is wired to the J and K inputs of FF2, one
input of the AND gate, and indicator A. The output of FF2 is wired to the other input of the AND gate
and indicator B. The AND output is connected to the J and K inputs of FF3. The C indicator is the only
output of FF3.
</p><p class="paragraph">During the explanation of this circuit, you should follow the logic diagram, view A, and the pulse
sequences, view B.
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume the following initial conditions: The outputs of all FFs, the clock, and the AND gate are 0;
the J and K inputs to FF1 are HIGH. The negative-going portion of the clock pulse will be used

</p><p class="paragraph">FF3 are unaffected by the first clock pulse because the J and K inputs were LOW when the clock pulse
was applied.
</p><p class="paragraph">As clock pulse 2 goes LOW, FF1 resets, turning off lamp A. In turn, FF2 will set, lighting lamp B
and showing a count of 0102. The HIGH from FF2 is also felt by the AND gate. The AND gate is not
activated at this time because the signal from FF1 is now a LOW. A LOW is present on the J and K inputs
of FF3, so it is not toggled by the clock.
</p><p class="paragraph">Clock pulse 3 toggles FF1 again and lights lamp A. Since the J and K inputs to FF2 were LOW when
pulse 3 occurred, FF2 does not toggle but remains set. Lamps A and B are lit, indicating a count of 0112.
With both FF1 and FF2 set, HIGHs are input to both inputs of the AND gate, resulting in HIGHs to J and
K of FF3. No change occurred in the output of FF3 on clock pulse 3 because the J and K inputs were
LOW at the time.
</p><p class="paragraph">Just before clock pulse 4 occurs, we have the following conditions: FF1 and FF2 are set, and the
AND gate is outputting a HIGH to the J and K inputs of FF3. With these conditions all of the FFs will
toggle with the next clock pulse.
</p><p class="paragraph">At clock pulse 4, FF1 and FF2 are reset, and FF3 sets. The output of the AND gate goes to 0, and we
have a count of 1002.
</p><p class="paragraph">It appears that the clock pulse and the AND output both go to 0 at the same time, but the clock pulse
arrives at FF3 before the AND gate goes LOW because of the transit time of the signal through FF1, FF2,
and the AND gate.
</p><p class="paragraph">Between pulses 4 and 8, FF3 remains set because the J and K inputs are LOW. FF1 and FF2 toggle
in the same sequence as they did on clock pulses 1, 2, and 3.
</p><p class="paragraph">Clock pulse 7 results in all of the FFs being set and the AND gate output being HIGH. Clock pulse 8
causes all the FFs to reset and all the lamps to turn off, indicating a count of 0002 . The next clock pulse
(9) will restart the count sequence.

stage counter can be easily modified to a decade counter by adding a NAND gate as shown in figure 3-25.
Notice that FF2 and FF4 provide the inputs to the NAND gate. The NAND gate outputs are connected to
the CLR input of each of the FFs.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-26, view A, shows a typical four-stage ring counter. This particular counter is composed of
R-S FFs. J-K FFs may be used as well. Notice that the output of each AND gate is input to the R, or reset

input of the AND gate that is connected to its own R input.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A register is a temporary storage device. Registers are used to store data, memory addresses, and
operation codes. Registers are normally referred to by the number of stages they contain or by the number
of bits they will store. For instance, an eight-stage register would be called an 8-bit register. The contents
of the register is also called a WORD. The contents of an 8-bit register is an 8-bit word. The contents of a
4-bit register is a 4-bit word and so forth.
</p><p class="paragraph">Registers are also used in the transfer of data to and from input and output devices such as teletypes,
printers, and cathode-ray tubes.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Parallel registers are designed to receive or transfer all bits of data or information simultaneously.
</p><p class="paragraph">A 4-bit parallel register is shown in figure 3-28. The data inputs are A, B, C, and D. The FFs store
the data until it is needed. AND gates 5, 6, 7, and 8 are the transfer gates.

READ OUT, and RESET inputs are all LOW.
</p><p class="paragraph">To begin the operation, we apply a reset pulse to the RESET input of all the FFs, clearing the Q
outputs to LOWs. This step ensures against any erroneous data transfer that would occur because of the

</p><p class="paragraph">Inputs A, B, C, and D are input to gates 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. When the READ IN input goes
HIGH, AND gates 1, 2, and 4 go HIGH, causing FF1, FF2, and FF4 to set. The output of AND gate 3
does not change since the C input is LOW. The 4-bit word, 1101, is now stored in the register. The

parallel-to-serial conversion, and scaling.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Serial and Parallel Transfers and Conversion
</h3><p class="paragraph">Serial and parallel are terms used to describe the method in which data or information is moved from
one place to another. SERIAL TRANSFER means that the data is moved along a single line one bit at a

is moved on its own line and that all bits transfer simultaneously as they did in the parallel register. A
single control pulse is required to move all bits.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-29 shows how both of these transfers occur. In each case, the four-bit word 1101 is being

their value, and shifting to the right decreases their value. The increase or decrease in value is based on
powers of 2.
</p><p class="paragraph">A shift of one place to the left increases the value by a power of 2, which in effect is multiplying the
number by 2. To demonstrate this, let’s assume that the following block diagram is a 5-bit shift register
containing the binary number 01100.

has a value of 2410. By shifting the number one place to the left, we have multiplied it by 2. A shift of two
places to the left would be the equivalent of multiplying the number by 22, or 4; three places by 23, or 8;
and so forth.
</p><p class="paragraph">Shifting a binary number to the right decreases the value of the number by a power of 2 for each

</p><p class="paragraph">At CP1, a CLEAR pulse is applied to all the FFs, resetting the register to a count of 0. The number
01012 is applied to the parallel inputs at CP2, causing FF1 and FF3 to set. At this point, the J inputs of
FF2 and FF4 are HIGH. AND gate 2 has a LOW output since the FF4 output is LOW. This LOW output
represents the first digit of the number 01012 to be output in serial form. At the same time we have
HIGHs on the K inputs of FF1 and FF3. (Notice the NOT symbol on FF1 at input K. With no serial input
to AND gate 1, the output is LOW; therefore, the K input to FF1 is held HIGH). With these conditions
CP3 causes FF1 and FF3 to reset and FF2 and FF4 to set. The HIGH output of FF4, along with CP3,
causes AND gate 2 to output a HIGH. This represents the second digit of the number 01012.
</p><p class="paragraph">At CP4, FF2 and FF4 reset, and FF3 sets. FF1 remains reset because of the HIGH at the K input. The
output of AND gate 2 goes LOW because the output of FF4 is LOW and the third digit of the number is
output on the serial line. CP5 causes FF4 to set and FF3 to reset. CP5 and the HIGH from FF4 cause
AND gate 2 to output the last digit of the number on the serial line. It took a total of four CLK pulses to
input the number in parallel and output it in serial.
</p><p class="paragraph">CP6 causes FF4 to reset and effectively clears the register for the next parallel input.

out one bit at a time, we shift the data in one bit at a time.

</p><p class="paragraph">A CLEAR pulse resets all the FFs at CP1. At CP2, the most significant bit of the data is input to
AND gate 1. This HIGH along with the clock pulse causes AND gate 1 to output a HIGH. The HIGH
from the AND gate and the clock pulse applied to FF1 cause the FF to set. FFs 2, 3, and 4 are held reset.
At this point, the MSD of the data has been shifted into the register.
</p><p class="paragraph">The next bit of data is a 0. The output of AND gate 1 is LOW. Because of the inverter on the K input
of FF1, the FF senses a HIGH at that input and resets. At the same time this is occurring, the HIGH on the
J input of FF2 (from FF1) and the CLK cause FF2 to set. The two MSDs, 1 and 0, are now in the register.
</p><p class="paragraph">CP4 causes FF3 to set and FF2 to reset. FF1 is set by the CLK pulse and the third bit of the number.
The register now contains 01012, as a result of shifting the first three bits of data.
</p><p class="paragraph">The remaining bit is shifted into the register by CP5. FF1 remains set, FF2 sets, FF3 resets, and FF4
sets. At this point, the serial transfer is complete. The binary word can be sampled on the parallel output
lines. Once the parallel data is transferred, a CLEAR pulse resets the FFs (CP6), and the register is ready
to input the next word.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Scaling Operation
</h3><p class="paragraph">Using the shift register shown in figure 3-31 for scaling a number is quite simple. The number to be
scaled is loaded into the register either in serial or parallel form. Once the data is in the register, the
scaling takes place in the same manner as that for shifting the data for serial output. A single clock pulse
will cause each bit of data to shift one place to the left. Remember that each shift is the equivalent of
increasing the value by a power of 2. The scaled data is read from the parallel outputs. Care must be taken
not to over shift the data to the point that the MSDs are shifted out of the register.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LOGIC-FAMILIES-3-38-">LOGIC FAMILIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">Logic families are groups of logic circuits that are based on particular types of elements (resistors,
transistors, and so forth). Families are identified by the manner in which the elements are connected, and,
in some cases, by the types of elements used.
</p><p class="paragraph">Logic circuits of a particular family can be interconnected without having to use additional circuitry.
In other words, the output of one logic circuit can be used as the input to another logic circuit. This
feature is known as compatibility. All circuits within a logic family will be compatible with the other
circuits within that family.
</p><p class="paragraph">As a technician, your responsibility will be to identify defective parts and repair or replace them as
required. It will be beneficial for you to have a basic knowledge of the types of logic that are used in
digital equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">Logic circuits are usually manufactured as integrated circuits and packaged in dual-inline packages
(DIP), modified transistor outlines (TO), or flat packs. These packaging techniques are described in
NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies.
</p><p class="paragraph">Circuitry in a package is normally shown using standard logic symbols instead of individual
components such as transistors, diodes, and so forth. Figure 3-34 shows four examples of this type of
packaging. The numbered blocks (1-14 and 1-16) are the pins on the package. Circuit packages are also
identified by a manufacturer’s part number. Similar circuits produced by different manufacturers will not
carry the same identification numbers in all cases.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">As mentioned before, logic families are identified by the elements used and the manner in which the
elements are used. A brief description of some of the more common logic families follows.
</p><p class="paragraph">RTL (RESISTOR-TRANSISTOR LOGIC)
In this type of logic, inputs are applied to resistors, and the output is produced by a transistor. RTL is
</p><p class="paragraph">normally constructed from discrete components (individual resistors and transistors). Some circuits are
manufactured as integrated circuits and packaged in modified transistor outline (TO) packages, as shown
in figure 3-35. An in-depth coverage of circuit packaging can be found in NEETS, Module 14,
Introduction to Microelectronics.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">DTL (DIODE TRANSISTOR LOGIC)
Input signals are applied to diodes in this logic family. The diodes either conduct or cut off and
</p><p class="paragraph">produce the desired output from the transistor. DTL is normally found in dual-inline packages (DIP) as
well as older discrete component logic.
</p><p class="paragraph">TTL (TRANSISTOR-TRANSISTOR LOGIC)
In TTL, transistors with multiple emitters are used for the logic inputs. Additional transistors are
</p><p class="paragraph">used to produce the desired output. TTL is normally packed in DIPs and is quite common in military
equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">CMOS (COMPLEMENTARY METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTORS)
The CMOS logic circuits use metal oxide semiconductors similar to field-effect transistors (FETs).
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LOGIC-FAMILY-USE-3-40-">LOGIC FAMILY USE
</h2><p class="paragraph">The logic family used in a piece of equipment is determined by the design engineers. The type of
logic used will be based on the requirements of the equipment and on what family best fulfills the
requirements.
</p><p class="paragraph">The use of integrated circuits enables designers to produce equipment that is very small and highly
efficient when compared to other methods of construction. The block diagram shown in figure 3-36, view
A, represents an 8-bit, serial-input and parallel-output shift register. This circuit is contained in a standard
