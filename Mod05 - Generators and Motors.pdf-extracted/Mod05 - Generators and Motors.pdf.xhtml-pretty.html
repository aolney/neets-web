SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current
(dc). It also describes some of the general safety precautions and first-aid procedures that should be

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The pole pieces (marked N and S) provide the magnetic field. The pole pieces are shaped and 
positioned as shown to concentrate the magnetic field as close as possible to the wire loop. The loop of 
wire that rotates through the field is called the ARMATURE. The ends of the armature loop are connected 
to rings called SLIP RINGS. They rotate with the armature. The brushes, usually made of carbon, with 
wires attached to them, ride against the rings. The generated voltage appears across these brushes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The elementary generator produces a voltage in the following manner (fig. 1-3). The armature loop is 
rotated in a clockwise direction. The initial or starting point is shown at position A. (This will be 
considered the zero-degree position.) At 0º  the armature loop is perpendicular to the magnetic field. The 
black and white conductors of the loop are moving parallel to the field. The instant the conductors are 
moving parallel to the magnetic field, they do not cut any lines of flux. Therefore, no emf is induced in 
the conductors, and the meter at position A indicates zero. This position is called the NEUTRAL PLANE. 
As the armature loop rotates from position A (0º) to position B (90º), the conductors cut through more and 
more lines of flux, at a continually increasing angle. At 90º  they are cutting through a maximum number 
of lines of flux and at maximum angle. The result is that between 0º  and 90º , the induced emf in the 
conductors builds up from zero to a maximum value. Observe that from 0º  to 90º , the black conductor 
cuts DOWN through the field. At the same time the white conductor cuts UP through the field. The 
induced emfs in the conductors are series-adding. This means the resultant voltage across the brushes (the 
terminal voltage) is the sum of the two induced voltages. The meter at position B reads maximum value. 
As the armature loop continues rotating from 90º  (position B) to 180º  (position C), the conductors which 
were cutting through a maximum number of lines of flux at position B now cut through fewer lines. They 
are again moving parallel to the magnetic field at position C. They no longer cut through any lines of flux. 
As the armature rotates from 90º  to 180º , the induced voltage will decrease to zero in the same manner 
that it increased during the rotation from 0º  to 90º . The meter again reads zero. From 0º  to 180º  the 
conductors of the armature loop have been moving in the same direction through the magnetic field. 
Therefore, the polarity of the induced voltage has remained the same. This is shown by points A through 
C on the graph. As the loop rotates beyond 180º  (position C), through 270º  (position D), and back to the 
initial or starting point (position A), the direction of the cutting action of the conductors through the 
magnetic field reverses. Now the black conductor cuts UP through the field while the white conductor 
cuts DOWN through the field. As a result, the polarity of the induced voltage reverses. Following the 
sequence shown by graph points C, D, and back to A, the voltage will be in the direction opposite to that </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">A single-loop generator with each terminal connected to a segment of a two-segment metal ring is 
shown in figure 1-4. The two segments of the split metal ring are insulated from each other. This forms a 
simple COMMUTATOR. The commutator in a dc generator replaces the slip rings of the ac generator. 
This is the main difference in their construction. The commutator mechanically reverses the armature 
loop connections to the external circuit. This occurs at the same instant that the polarity of the voltage in 
the armature loop reverses. Through this process the commutator changes the generated ac voltage to a 
pulsating dc voltage as shown in the graph of figure 1-4. This action is known as commutation. 
Commutation is described in detail later in this chapter. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">For the remainder of this discussion, refer to figure 1-4, parts A through D. This will help you in 
following the step-by-step description of the operation of a dc generator. When the armature loop rotates 
clockwise from position A to position B, a voltage is induced in the armature loop which causes a current 
in a direction that deflects the meter to the right. Current flows through loop, out of the negative brush, 
through the meter and the load, and back through the positive brush to the loop. Voltage reaches its 
maximum value at point B on the graph for reasons explained earlier. The generated voltage and the 
current fall to zero at position C. At this instant each brush makes contact with both segments of the 
commutator. As the armature loop rotates to position D, a voltage is again induced in the loop. In this 
case, however, the voltage is of opposite polarity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltages induced in the two sides of the coil at position D are in the reverse direction to that of 
the voltages shown at position B. Note that the current is flowing from the black side to the white side in 
position B and from the white side to the black side in position D. However, because the segments of the 
commutator have rotated with the loop and are contacted by opposite brushes, the direction of current 
flow through the brushes and the meter remains the same as at position B. The voltage developed across 
the brushes is pulsating and unidirectional (in one direction only). It varies twice during each revolution 
between zero and maximum. This variation is called RIPPLE. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A pulsating voltage, such as that produced in the preceding description, is unsuitable for most 
applications. Therefore, in practical generators more armature loops (coils) and more commutator 
segments are used to produce an output voltage waveform with less ripple.

terminals?

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-EFFECTS-OF-ADDING-ADDITIONAL-COILS-AND-POLES-1-6-">EFFECTS OF ADDING ADDITIONAL COILS AND POLES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The effects of additional coils may be illustrated by the addition of a second coil to the armature. The 
commutator must now be divided into four parts since there are four coil ends (see fig. 1-5). The coil is 
rotated in a clockwise direction from the position shown. The voltage induced in the white coil, 
DECREASES FOR THE NEXT 90º  of rotation (from maximum to zero). The voltage induced in the 
black coil INCREASES from zero to maximum at the same time. Since there are four segments in the 
commutator, a new segment passes each brush every 90º  instead of every 180º . This allows the brush to 
switch from the white coil to the black coil at the instant the voltages in the two coils are equal. The brush 
remains in contact with the black coil as its induced voltage increases to maximum, level B in the graph. 
It then decreases to level A, 90º  later. At this point, the brush will contact the white coil again. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The graph in figure 1-5 shows the ripple effect of the voltage when two armature coils are used. 
Since there are now four commutator segments in the commutator and only two brushes, the voltage 
cannot fall any lower than at point A. Therefore, the ripple is limited to the rise and fall between points A 
and B on the graph. By adding more armature coils, the ripple effect can be further reduced. Decreasing 
ripple in this way increases the effective voltage of the output. 
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: Effective voltage is the equivalent level of dc voltage, which will cause the same average 
current through a given resistance. By using additional armature coils, the voltage across the brushes is 
not allowed to fall to as low a level between peaks. Compare the graphs in figure 1-4 and 1-5. Notice that 
the ripple has been reduced. Practical generators use many armature coils. They also use more than one 
pair of magnetic poles. The additional magnetic poles have the same effect on ripple as did the additional 
armature coils. In addition, the increased number of poles provides a stronger magnetic field (greater 
number of flux lines). This, in turn, allows an increase in output voltage because the coils cut more lines 
of flux per revolution.

our elementary generator. The electromagnetic field poles consist of coils of insulated copper wire wound 
on soft iron cores, as shown in figure 1-6. The main advantages of using electromagnetic poles are (1) 
increased field strength and (2) a means of controlling the strength of the fields. By varying the input 
voltage, the field strength is varied. By varying the field strength, the output voltage of the generator can 
be controlled.

</p><p class="question">Q9. How can field strength be varied in a practical dc generator? 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMMUTATION-1-7-">COMMUTATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Commutation is the process by which a dc voltage output is taken from an armature that has an ac 
voltage induced in it. You should remember from our discussion of the elementary dc generator that the 
commutator mechanically reverses the armature loop connections to the external circuit. This occurs at 
the same instant that the voltage polarity in the armature loop reverses. A dc voltage is applied to the load 
because the output connections are reversed as each commutator segment passes under a brush. The 
segments are insulated from each other. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 1-7, commutation occurs simultaneously in the two coils that are briefly short-circuited by 
the brushes. Coil B is short-circuited by the negative brush. Coil Y, the opposite coil, is short-circuited by 
the positive brush. The brushes are positioned on the commutator so that each coil is short-circuited as it 
moves through its own electrical neutral plane. As you have seen previously, there is no voltage generated 
in the coil at that time. Therefore, no sparking can occur between the commutator and the brush. Sparking 
between the brushes and the commutator is an indication of improper commutation. Improper brush 
placement is the main cause of improper commutation. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">From previous study, you know that all current-carrying conductors produce magnetic fields. The 
magnetic field produced by current in the armature of a dc generator affects the flux pattern and distorts 
the main field. This distortion causes a shift in the neutral plane, which affects commutation. This change 
in the neutral plane and the reaction of the magnetic field is called ARMATURE REACTION. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You know that for proper commutation, the coil short-circuited by the brushes must be in the neutral 
plane. Consider the operation of a simple two-pole dc generator, shown in figure 1-8. View A of the 
figure shows the field poles and the main magnetic field. The armature is shown in a simplified view in 
views B and C with the cross section of its coil represented as little circles. The symbols within the circles 
represent arrows. The dot represents the point of the arrow coming toward you, and the cross represents 
the tail, or feathered end, going away from you. When the armature rotates clockwise, the sides of the coil 
to the left will have current flowing toward you, as indicated by the dot. The side of the coil to the right 
will have current flowing away from you, as indicated by the cross. The field generated around each side 
of the coil is shown in view B of figure 1-8. This field increases in strength for each wire in the armature 
coil, and sets up a magnetic field almost perpendicular to the main field. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

circuiting coils that have voltage induced in them. Consequently, there will be arcing between the brushes 
and commutator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To prevent arcing, the brushes must be shifted to the new neutral plane.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMPENSATING-WINDINGS-AND-INTERPOLES-1-9-">COMPENSATING WINDINGS AND INTERPOLES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Shifting the brushes to the advanced position (the new neutral plane) does not completely solve the 
problems of armature reaction. The effect of armature reaction varies with the load current. Therefore, 
each time the load current varies, the neutral plane shifts. This means the brush position must be changed 
each time the load current varies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In small generators, the effects of armature reaction are reduced by actually mechanically shifting the 
position of the brushes. The practice of shifting the brush position for each current variation is not 
practiced except in small generators. In larger generators, other means are taken to eliminate armature 
reaction. COMPENSATING WINDINGS or INTERPOLES are used for this purpose (fig. 1-9). The 
compensating windings consist of a series of coils embedded in slots in the pole faces. These coils are 
connected in series with the armature. The series-connected compensating windings produce a magnetic 
field, which varies directly with armature current. Because the compensating windings are wound to 
produce a field that opposes the magnetic field of the armature, they tend to cancel the effects of the 
armature magnetic field. The neutral plane will remain stationary and in its original position for all values 
of armature current. Because of this, once the brushes have been set correctly, they do not have to be 
moved again. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Another way to reduce the effects of armature reaction is to place small auxiliary poles called 
"interpoles" between the main field poles. The interpoles have a few turns of large wire and are connected 
in series with the armature. Interpoles are wound and placed so that each interpole has the same magnetic 
polarity as the main pole ahead of it, in the direction of rotation. The field generated by the interpoles 
produces the same effect as the compensating winding. This field, in effect, cancels the armature reaction 
for all values of load current by causing a shift in the neutral plane opposite to the shift caused by 
armature reaction. The amount of shift caused by the interpoles will equal the shift caused by armature 
reaction since both shifts are a result of armature current.

opposes the rotation of the armature. This is called MOTOR REACTION. A single armature conductor is 
represented in figure 1-10, view A. When the conductor is stationary, no voltage is generated and no 
current flows. Therefore, no force acts on the conductor. When the conductor is moved downward (fig. 1-
10, view B) and the circuit is completed through an external load, current flows through the conductor in

</p><p class="paragraph">The interaction between the conductor field and the main field of the generator weakens the field 
above the conductor and strengthens the field below the conductor. The main field consists of lines that 
now act like stretched rubber bands. Thus, an upward reaction force is produced that acts in opposition to 
the downward driving force applied to the armature conductor. If the current in the conductor increases, 
the reaction force increases. Therefore, more force must be applied to the conductor to keep it moving. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With no armature current, there is no magnetic (motor) reaction. Therefore, the force required to turn 
the armature is low. As the armature current increases, the reaction of each armature conductor against 
rotation increases. The actual force in a generator is multiplied by the number of conductors in the 
armature. The driving force required to maintain the generator armature speed must be increased to 
overcome the motor reaction. The force applied to turn the armature must overcome the motor reaction 
force in all dc generators. The device that provides the turning force applied to the armature is called the 
PRIME MOVER. The prime mover may be an electric motor, a gasoline engine, a steam turbine, or any

</p><h3 class="subsection">Copper Losses 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The power lost in the form of heat in the armature winding of a generator is known as COPPER 
LOSS. Heat is generated any time current flows in a conductor. Copper loss is an I2R loss, which 
increases as current increases. The amount of heat generated is also proportional to the resistance of the 
conductor. The resistance of the conductor varies directly with its length and inversely with its cross-
sectional area. Copper loss is minimized in armature windings by using large diameter wire. 
</p><p class="question">Q14. What causes copper losses? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Eddy Current Losses 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The core of a generator armature is made from soft iron, which is a conducting material with 
desirable magnetic characteristics. Any conductor will have currents induced in it when it is rotated in a 
magnetic field. These currents that are induced in the generator armature core are called EDDY 
CURRENTS. The power dissipated in the form of heat, as a result of the eddy currents, is considered a 
loss. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Eddy currents, just like any other electrical currents, are affected by the resistance of the material in 
which the currents flow. The resistance of any material is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional 
area. Figure 1-11, view A, shows the eddy currents induced in an armature core that is a solid piece of 
soft iron. Figure 1-11, view B, shows a soft iron core of the same size, but made up of several small 
pieces insulated from each other. This process is called lamination. The currents in each piece of the 
laminated core are considerably less than in the solid core because the resistance of the pieces is much 
higher. (Resistance is inversely proportional to cross-sectional area.) The currents in the individual pieces 
of the laminated core are so small that the sum of the individual currents is much less than the total of 
eddy currents in the solid iron core.

</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see, eddy current losses are kept low when the core material is made up of many thin 
sheets of metal. Laminations in a small generator armature may be as thin as 1/64 inch. The laminations 
are insulated from each other by a thin coat of lacquer or, in some instances, simply by the oxidation of 
the surfaces. Oxidation is caused by contact with the air while the laminations are being annealed. The 
insulation value need not be high because the voltages induced are very small. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most generators use armatures with laminated cores to reduce eddy current losses. 
</p><p class="question">Q15. How can eddy current be reduced? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Hysteresis Losses 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Hysteresis loss is a heat loss caused by the magnetic properties of the armature. When an armature 
core is in a magnetic field, the magnetic particles of the core tend to line up with the magnetic field. When 
the armature core is rotating, its magnetic field keeps changing direction. The continuous movement of 
the magnetic particles, as they try to align themselves with the magnetic field, produces molecular 
friction. This, in turn, produces heat. This heat is transmitted to the armature windings. The heat causes 
armature resistances to increase. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To compensate for hysteresis losses, heat-treated silicon steel laminations are used in most dc 
generator armatures. After the steel has been formed to the proper shape, the laminations are heated and 
allowed to cool. This annealing process reduces the hysteresis loss to a low value.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-PRACTICAL-DC-GENERATOR-1-13-">THE PRACTICAL DC GENERATOR 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The actual construction and operation of a practical dc generator differs somewhat from our 
elementary generators. The differences are in the construction of the armature, the manner in which the 
armature is wound, and the method of developing the main field. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A generator that has only one or two armature loops has high ripple voltage. This results in too little 
current to be of any practical use. To increase the amount of current output, a number of loops of wire are 
used. These additional loops do away with most of the ripple. The loops of wire, called windings, are 
evenly spaced around the armature so that the distance between each winding is the same. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The commutator in a practical generator is also different. It has several segments instead of two or 
four, as in our elementary generators. The number of segments must equal the number of armature coils.

of coil 1 goes to segment B. One end of coil 2 goes to segment C, and the other end of coil 2 goes to 
segment B. The rest of the coils are connected in a like manner, in series, around the armature. To 
complete the series arrangement, coil 8 connects to segment A. Therefore, each coil is in series with every 
other coil. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The windings of a Gramme-ring armature are placed on an iron ring. A disadvantage of this 
arrangement is that the windings located on the inner side of the iron ring cut few lines of flux. Therefore, 
they have little, if any, voltage induced in them. For this reason, the Gramme-ring armature is not widely 
used.

drum-shaped iron core. Each winding completely surrounds the core so that the entire length of the 
conductor cuts the main magnetic field. Therefore, the total voltage induced in the armature is greater 
than in the Gramme-ring. You can see that the drum-type armature is much more efficient than the 
Gramme-ring. This accounts for the almost universal use of the drum-type armature in modem dc 
generators.

field and allows the armature to generate a higher voltage. The higher voltage increases the field strength, 
and so on. This process continues until the output voltage reaches the rated output of the generator. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CLASSIFICATION-OF-GENERATORS-1-16-">CLASSIFICATION OF GENERATORS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Self-excited generators are classed according to the type of field connection they use. There are three 
general types of field connections — SERIES-WOUND, SHUNT-WOUND (parallel), and 
COMPOUND-WOUND. Compound-wound generators are further classified as cumulative-compound 
and differential-compound. These last two classifications are not discussed in this chapter. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Series-Wound Generator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the series-wound generator, shown in figure 1-15, the field windings are connected in series with 
the armature. Current that flows in the armature flows through the external circuit and through the field 
windings. The external circuit connected to the generator is called the load circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A series-wound generator uses very low resistance field coils, which consist of a few turns of large 
diameter wire. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltage output increases as the load circuit starts drawing more current. Under low-load current 
conditions, the current that flows in the load and through the generator is small. Since small current 
means that a small magnetic field is set up by the field poles, only a small voltage is induced in the 
armature. If the resistance of the load decreases, the load current increases. Under this condition, more 
current flows through the field. This increases the magnetic field and increases the output voltage. A 
series-wound dc generator has the characteristic that the output voltage varies with load current. This is 
undesirable in most applications. For this reason, this type of generator is rarely used in everyday 
practice.

</h3><p class="paragraph">In a shunt-wound generator, like the one shown in figure 1-16, the field coils consist of many turns 
of small wire. They are connected in parallel with the load. In other words, they are connected across the 
output voltage of the armature. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Current in the field windings of a shunt-wound generator is independent of the load current (currents 
in parallel branches are independent of each other). Since field current, and therefore field strength, is not 
affected by load current, the output voltage remains more nearly constant than does the output voltage of 
the series-wound generator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In actual use, the output voltage in a dc shunt-wound generator varies inversely as load current 
varies. The output voltage decreases as load current increases because the voltage drop across the 
armature resistance increases (E = IR). 
</p><p class="paragraph">In a series-wound generator, output voltage varies directly with load current. In the shunt-wound 
generator, output voltage varies inversely with load current. A combination of the two types can 
overcome the disadvantages of both. This combination of windings is called the compound-wound dc 
generator. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Compound-Wound Generators

shown in figure 1-17. The shunt and series windings are wound on the same pole pieces. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the compound-wound generator when load current increases, the armature voltage decreases just 
as in the shunt-wound generator. This causes the voltage applied to the shunt-field winding to decrease, 
which results in a decrease in the magnetic field. This same increase in load current, since it flows 
through the series winding, causes an increase in the magnetic field produced by that winding. 
</p><p class="paragraph">By proportioning the two fields so that the decrease in the shunt field is just compensated by the 
increase in the series field, the output voltage remains constant. This is shown in figure 1-18, which 
shows the voltage characteristics of the series-, shunt-, and compound-wound generators. As you can see, 
by proportioning the effects of the two fields (series and shunt), a compound-wound generator provides a 
constant output voltage under varying load conditions. Actual curves are seldom, if ever, as perfect as 
shown.

normal dc generator, a small dc voltage applied to the field windings is able to control the output of the 
generator. In a typical generator, a change in voltage from 0-volt dc to 3-volts dc applied to the field 
winding may cause the generator output to vary from 0-volt dc to 300-volts dc. If the 3 volts applied to 
the field winding is considered an input, and the 300 volts taken from the brushes is an output, there is a 
gain of 100. Gain is expressed as the ratio of output to input:

controls 10,000 watts.

</p><p class="paragraph">field now requires a control voltage of only 1 volt and an input power of 1 watt (1 volt across 1 ohm 
causes 1 ampere of current, which produces 1 watt of input power). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The next step is to add another set of brushes. These now become the output brushes of the 
amplidyne. They are placed against the commutator in a position perpendicular to the original brushes, as 
shown in figure 1-24. The previously shorted brushes are now called the "quadrature" brushes. This is 
because they are in quadrature (perpendicular) to the output brushes. The output brushes are in line with 
the armature flux. Therefore, they pick off the voltage induced in the armature windings at this point. The 
voltage at the output will be the same as in the original generator, 115 volts in our example. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As you have seen, the original generator produced a 10,000-watt output with a 100-watt input. The 
amplidyne produces the same 10,000-watt output with only a 1-watt input. This represents a gain of 
10,000. The gain of the original generator has been greatly increased. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As previously stated, an amplidyne is used to provide large dc currents. The primary use of an 
amplidyne is in the positioning of heavy loads through the use of synchro/servo systems. Synchro/servo 
systems will be studied in a later module. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume that a very large turning force is required to rotate a heavy object, such as an antenna, to a 
very precise position. A low-power, relatively weak voltage representing the amount of antenna rotation 
required can be used to control the field winding of an amplidyne. Because of the amplidyne's ability to 
amplify, its output can be used to drive a powerful motor, which turns the heavy object (antenna). When 
the source of the input voltage senses the correct movement of the object, it drops the voltage to zero. The 
field is no longer strong enough to allow an output voltage to be developed, so the motor ceases to drive 
the object (antenna). 
</p><p class="paragraph">The above is an oversimplification and is not meant to describe a functioning system. The intent is to 
show a typical sequence of events between the demand for movement and the movement itself. It is meant 
to strengthen the idea that with the amplidyne, something large and heavy can be controlled very 
precisely by something very small, almost insignificant.

</p><p class="paragraph">To find the direction of motion of a conductor, extend the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of 
your right hand so they are at right angles to each other. If the forefinger is pointed in the direction of 
magnetic flux (north to south) and the middle finger is pointed in the direction of current flow in the 
conductor, the thumb will point in the direction the conductor will move. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Stated very simply, a dc motor rotates as a result of two magnetic fields interacting with each other. 
The armature of a dc motor acts like an electromagnet when current flows through its coils. Since the 
armature is located within the magnetic field of the field poles, these two magnetic fields interact. Like 
magnetic poles repel each other, and unlike magnetic poles attract each other. As in the dc generator, the 
dc motor has field poles that are stationary and an armature that turns on bearings in the space between 
the field poles. The armature of a dc motor has windings on it just like the armature of a dc generator. 
These windings are also connected to commutator segments. A dc motor consists of the same components 
as a dc generator. In fact, most dc generators can be made to act as motors, and vice versa. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at the simple dc motor shown in figure 2-2. It has two field poles, one a north pole and one a 
south pole. The magnetic lines of force extend across the opening between the poles from north to south. 
</p><p class="paragraph">

</p><p class="paragraph">current flowing through it from an external source. This current causes a magnetic field to be produced. 
This field is indicated by the dotted line through the loops. The loop (armature) field is both attracted and 
repelled by the field from the field poles. Since the current through the loop goes around in the direction 
of the arrows, the north pole of the armature is at the upper left, and the south pole of the armature is at 
the lower right, as shown in figure 2-2, (view A). Of course, as the loop (armature) turns, these magnetic 
poles turn with it. Now, as shown in the illustrations, the north armature pole is repelled from the north 
field pole and attracted to the right by the south field pole. Likewise, the south armature pole is repelled 
from the south field pole and is attracted to the left by the north field pole. This action causes the armature 
to turn in a clockwise direction, as shown in figure 2-2 (view B). 
</p><p class="paragraph">After the loop has turned far enough so that its north pole is exactly opposite the south field pole, the 
brushes advance to the next segments. This changes the direction of current flow through the armature 
loop. Also, it changes the polarity of the armature field, as shown in figure 2-2 (view C). The magnetic 
fields again repel and attract each other, and the armature continues to turn. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In this simple motor, the momentum of the rotating armature carries the armature past the position 
where the unlike poles are exactly lined up. However, if these fields are exactly lined up when the 
armature current is turned on, there is no momentum to start the armature moving. In this case, the motor 
would not rotate. It would be necessary to give a motor like this a spin to start it. This disadvantage does 
not exist when there are more turns on the armature, because there is more than one armature field. No 
two armature fields could be exactly aligned with the field from the field poles at the same time. 
</p><p class="question">Q1. What factors determine the direction of rotation in a dc motor? 
</p><p class="question">Q2. The right-hand rule for motors is used to find the relationship between what motor 
characteristics?

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COUNTER-EMF-2-3-">COUNTER EMF 
</h2><p class="paragraph">While a dc motor is running, it acts somewhat like a dc generator. There is a magnetic field from the 
field poles, and a loop of wire is turning and cutting this magnetic field. For the moment, disregard the 
fact that there is current flowing through the loop of wire from the battery. As the loop sides cut the 
magnetic field, a voltage is induced in them, the same as it was in the loop sides of the dc generator. This 
induced voltage causes current to flow in the loop. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, consider the relative direction between this current and the current that causes the motor to run. 
First, check the direction the current flows as a result of the generator action taking place (view A of fig.  
2-2). (Apply the left-hand rule for generators which was discussed in the last chapter.) Using the left 
hand, hold it so that the forefinger points in the direction of the magnetic field (north to south) and the 
thumb points in the direction that the black side of the armature moves (up). Your middle finger then 
points out of the paper (toward you), showing the direction of current flow caused by the generator action 
in the black half of the armature. This is in the direction opposite to that of the battery current. Since this 
generator-action voltage is opposite that of the battery, it is called "counter emf." (The letters emf stand 
for electromotive force, which is another name for voltage.) The two currents are flowing in opposite 
directions. This proves that the battery voltage and the counter emf are opposite in polarity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">At the beginning of this discussion, we disregarded armature current while explaining how counter 
emf was generated. Then, we showed that normal armature current flowed opposite to the current created

can never become as large as the applied voltage, and because they are of opposite polarity as we have 
seen, the counter emf effectively cancels part of the armature voltage. The single current that flows is 
armature current, but it is greatly reduced because of the counter emf. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In a dc motor, there is always a counter emf developed. This counter emf cannot be equal to or 
greater than the applied battery voltage; if it were, the motor would not run. The counter emf is always a 
little less. However, the counter emf opposes the applied voltage enough to keep the armature current 
from the battery to a fairly low value. If there were no such thing as counter emf, much more current 
would flow through the armature, and the motor would run much faster. However, there is no way to 
avoid the counter emf.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Motors are used to turn mechanical devices, such as water pumps, grinding wheels, fan blades, and 
circular saws. For example, when a motor is turning a water pump, the water pump is the load. The water 
pump is the mechanical device that the motor must move. This is the definition of a motor load. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As with electrical loads, the mechanical load connected to a dc motor affects many electrical 
quantities. Such things as the power drawn from the line, amount of current, speed, efficiency, etc., are all 
partially controlled by the size of the load. The physical and electrical characteristics of the motor must be 
matched to the requirements of the load if the work is to be done without the possibility of damage to 
either the load or the motor.

may be driven mechanically to generate a voltage, or it may be driven electrically to move a mechanical 
load. While this is not normally done, it does point out the similarities between the two machines. These 
similarities will be used in the remainder of this chapter to introduce you to practical dc motors. You will 
immediately recognize series, shunt, and compound types of motors as being directly related to their 
generator counterparts.

Because of this characteristic, the series dc motor can be used to operate small electric appliances, 
portable electric tools, cranes, winches, hoists, and the like. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another characteristic is that the speed varies widely between no-load and full-load. Series motors 
cannot be used where a relatively constant speed is required under conditions of varying load. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A major disadvantage of the series motor is related to the speed characteristic mentioned in the last 
paragraph. The speed of a series motor with no load connected to it increases to the point where the motor 
may become damaged. Usually, either the bearings are damaged or the windings fly out of the slots in the 
armature. There is a danger to both equipment and personnel. Some load must ALWAYS be connected to 
a series motor before you turn it on. This precaution is primarily for large motors. Small motors, such as 
those used in electric hand drills, have enough internal friction to load themselves.

</p><p class="paragraph">Once you adjust the speed of a dc shunt motor, the speed remains relatively constant even under 
changing load conditions. One reason for this is that the field flux remains constant. A constant voltage 
across the field makes the field independent of variations in the armature circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the load on the motor is increased, the motor tends to slow down. When this happens, the counter 
emf generated in the armature decreases. This causes a corresponding decrease in the opposition to 
battery current flow through the armature. Armature current increases, causing the motor to speed up. The 
conditions that established the original speed are reestablished, and the original speed is maintained. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Conversely, if the motor load is decreased, the motor tends to increase speed; counter emf increases, 
armature current decreases, and the speed decreases.

shunt field gives this type of motor the constant speed advantage of a regular shunt motor. The series field 
gives it the advantage of being able to develop a large torque when the motor is started under a heavy

Hold your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger at right angles. Point your forefinger in the direction of 
field flux; in this case, from left to right. Now turn your wrist so that your middle finger points in the 
direction that the current flows in the winding on the outside of the ring. Note that current flows into the

windings. Your thumb now points in the direction that the winding will move. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Gramme-ring armature is seldom used in modem dc motors. The windings on the inside of the

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DIRECTION-OF-ROTATION-2-9-">DIRECTION OF ROTATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The direction of rotation of a dc motor depends on the direction of the magnetic field and the 
direction of current flow in the armature. If either the direction of the field or the direction of current flow 
through the armature is reversed, the rotation of the motor will reverse. However, if both of these factors 
are reversed at the same time, the motor will continue rotating in the same direction. In actual practice, 
the field excitation voltage is reversed in order to reverse motor direction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Ordinarily, a motor is set up to do a particular job that requires a fixed direction of rotation. 
However, there are times when it is necessary to change the direction of rotation, such as a drive motor 
for a gun turret or missile launcher. Each of these must be able to move in both directions. Remember, the 
connections of either the armature or the field must be reversed, but not both. In such applications, the 
proper connections are brought out to a reversing switch. 
</p><p class="question">Q12. In a dc motor that must be able to rotate in both directions, how is the direction changed? 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MOTOR-SPEED-2-9-">MOTOR SPEED 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A motor whose speed can be controlled is called a variable-speed motor; dc motors are variable-
speed motors. The speed of a dc motor is changed by changing the current in the field or by changing the 
current in the armature. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the field current is decreased, the field flux is reduced, and the counter emf decreases. This 
permits more armature current. Therefore, the motor speeds up. When the field current is increased, the 
field flux is increased. More counter emf is developed, which opposes the armature current. The armature 
current then decreases, and the motor slows down. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the voltage applied to the armature is decreased, the armature current is decreased, and the 
motor again slows down. When the armature voltage and current are both increased, the motor speeds up. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In a shunt motor, speed is usually controlled by a rheostat connected in series with the field 
windings, as shown in figure 2-8. When the resistance of the rheostat is increased, the current through the 
field winding is decreased. The decreased flux momentarily decreases the counter emf. The motor then 
speeds up, and the increase in counter emf keeps the armature current the same. In a similar manner, a 
decrease in rheostat resistance increases the current flow through the field windings and causes the motor 
to slow down.

armature lowers the current through the armature and slows the motor. Moving the rheostat in a direction 
that increases the voltage and current through the armature increases motor speed. 
</p><p class="question">Q13. What is the effect on motor speed if the field current is increased? 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ARMATURE-REACTION-2-10-">ARMATURE REACTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">You will remember that the subject of armature reaction was covered in the previous chapter on dc 
generators. The reasons for armature reaction and the methods of compensating for its effects are 
basically the same for dc motors as for dc generators. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-9 reiterates for you the distorting effect that the armature field has on the flux between the 
pole pieces. Notice, however, that the effect has shifted the neutral plane backward, against the direction 
of rotation. This is different from a dc generator, where the neutral plane shifted forward in the direction 
of rotation. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As before, the brushes must be shifted to the new neutral plane. As shown in figure 2-9, the shift is 
counterclockwise. Again, the proper location is reached when there is no sparking from the brushes. 
</p><p class="question">Q14. Armature reaction in a dc motor causes a shift of the neutral plane in which direction? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Compensating windings and interpoles, two more "old" subjects, cancel armature reaction in dc 
motors. Shifting brushes reduces sparking, but it also makes the field less effective. Canceling armature 
reaction eliminates the need to shift brushes in the first place. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Compensating windings and interpoles are as important in motors as they are in generators. 
Compensating windings are relatively expensive; therefore, most large dc motors depend on interpoles to 
correct armature reaction. Compensating windings are the same in motors as they are in generators. 
Interpoles, however, are slightly different. The difference is that in a generator the interpole has the same 
polarity as the main pole AHEAD of it in the direction of rotation. In a motor the interpole has the same 
polarity as the main pole FOLLOWING it. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

As the load varies, the interpole flux varies, and commutation is automatically corrected as the load 
changes. It is not necessary to shift the brushes when there is an increase or decrease in load. The brushes 
are located on the no-load neutral plane. They remain in that position for all conditions of load. 
</p><p class="question">Q15. What current flows in the interpole windings? 
</p><p class="paragraph">The dc motor is reversed by reversing the direction of the current in the armature. When the armature 
current is reversed, the current through the interpole is also reversed. Therefore, the interpole still has the 
proper polarity to provide automatic commutation. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MANUAL-AND-AUTOMATIC-STARTERS-2-11-">MANUAL AND AUTOMATIC STARTERS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Because the dc resistance of most motor armatures is low (0.05 to 0.5 ohm), and because the counter 
emf does not exist until the armature begins to turn, it is necessary to use an external starting resistance in 
series with the armature of a dc motor to keep the initial armature current to a safe value. As the armature 
begins to turn, counter emf increases; and, since the counter emf opposes the applied voltage, the 
armature current is reduced. The external resistance in series with the armature is decreased or eliminated 
as the motor comes up to normal speed and full voltage is applied across the armature. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Controlling the starting resistance in a dc motor is accomplished either manually, by an operator, or 
by any of several automatic devices. The automatic devices are usually just switches controlled by motor

</h2><p class="paragraph">Most of the electrical power used aboard Navy ships and aircraft as well as in civilian applications is
ac. As a result, the ac generator is the most important means of producing electrical power. Ac generators,
generally called alternators, vary greatly in size depending upon the load to which they supply power. For
example, the alternators in use at hydroelectric plants, such as Hoover Dam, are tremendous in size,
generating thousands of kilowatts at very high voltage levels. Another example is the alternator in a
typical automobile, which is very small by comparison. It weighs only a few pounds and produces
between 100 and 200 watts of power, usually at a potential of 12 volts.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Regardless of size, all electrical generators, whether dc or ac, depend upon the principle of magnetic
induction. An emf is induced in a coil as a result of (1) a coil cutting through a magnetic field, or (2) a
magnetic field cutting through a coil. As long as there is relative motion between a conductor and a
magnetic field, a voltage will be induced in the conductor. That part of a generator that produces the
magnetic field is called the field. That part in which the voltage is induced is called the armature. For
relative motion to take place between the conductor and the magnetic field, all generators must have two
mechanical parts — a rotor and a stator. The ROTor is the part that ROTates; the STATor is the part that
remains STATionary. In a dc generator, the armature is always the rotor. In alternators, the armature may
be either the rotor or stator.
</p><p class="question"> Q1. Magnetic induction occurs when there is relative motion between what two elements?
ROTATING-ARMATURE ALTERNATORS
</p><p class="paragraph">The rotating-armature alternator is similar in construction to the dc generator in that the armature
rotates in a stationary magnetic field as shown in figure 3-1, view A. In the dc generator, the emf
generated in the armature windings is converted from ac to dc by means of the commutator. In the
alternator, the generated ac is brought to the load unchanged by means of slip rings. The rotating armature
is found only in alternators of low power rating and generally is not used to supply electric power in large
quantities.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A rotating armature requires slip rings and brushes to conduct the current from the armature to the
load. The armature, brushes, and slip rings are difficult to insulate, and arc-overs and short circuits can
result at high voltages. For this reason, high-voltage alternators are usually of the rotating-field type.
Since the voltage applied to the rotating field is low voltage dc, the problem of high voltage arc-over at
the slip rings does not exist.

except as examples to aid in understanding practical alternators.
</p><p class="paragraph">The remainder of this chapter will relate the principles of the elementary alternator to the alternators
actually in use in the civilian community, as well as aboard Navy ships and aircraft. The following
paragraphs in this chapter will introduce such concepts as prime movers, field excitation, armature

operation.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-FUNCTIONS-OF-ALTERNATOR-COMPONENTS-3-4-">FUNCTIONS OF ALTERNATOR COMPONENTS
</h2><p class="paragraph">A typical rotating-field ac generator consists of an alternator and a smaller dc generator built into a
single unit. The output of the alternator section supplies alternating voltage to the load. The only purpose
for the dc exciter generator is to supply the direct current required to maintain the alternator field. This dc
generator is referred to as the exciter. A typical alternator is shown in figure 3-3, view A; figure 3-3, view
B, is a simplified schematic of the generator.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The exciter is a dc, shunt-wound, self-excited generator. The exciter shunt field (2) creates an area of
intense magnetic flux between its poles. When the exciter armature (3) is rotated in the exciter-field flux,
voltage is induced in the exciter armature windings. The output from the exciter commutator (4) is
connected through brushes and slip rings (5) to the alternator field. Since this is direct current already
converted by the exciter commutator, the current always flows in one direction through the alternator field
(6). Thus, a fixed-polarity magnetic field is maintained at all times in the alternator field windings. When
the alternator field is rotated, its magnetic flux is passed through and across the alternator armature
windings (7).
</p><p class="paragraph">The armature is wound for a three-phase output, which will be covered later in this chapter.
Remember, a voltage is induced in a conductor if it is stationary and a magnetic field is passed across the
conductor, the same as if the field is stationary and the conductor is moved. The alternating voltage in the
ac generator armature windings is connected through fixed terminals to the ac load.

</h2><p class="paragraph">All generators, large and small, ac and dc, require a source of mechanical power to turn their rotors.
This source of mechanical energy is called a prime mover.
</p><p class="paragraph">Prime movers are divided into two classes for generators-high-speed and low-speed. Steam and gas
turbines are high-speed prime movers, while internal-combustion engines, water, and electric motors are
considered low-speed prime movers.
</p><p class="paragraph">The type of prime mover plays an important part in the design of alternators since the speed at which
the rotor is turned determines certain characteristics of alternator construction and operation.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ALTERNATOR-ROTORS-3-6-">ALTERNATOR ROTORS
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are two types of rotors used in rotating-field alternators. They are called the turbine-driven and
salient-pole rotors.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you may have guessed, the turbine-driven rotor shown in figure 3-4, view A, is used when the
prime mover is a high-speed turbine. The windings in the turbine-driven rotor are arranged to form two or
four distinct poles. The windings are firmly embedded in slots to withstand the tremendous centrifugal
forces encountered at high speeds.
</p><p class="paragraph">The salient-pole rotor shown in figure 3-4, view B, is used in low-speed alternators. The salient-pole
rotor often consists of several separately wound pole pieces, bolted to the frame of the rotor.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Alternators are rated according to the voltage they are designed to produce and the maximum current
they are capable of providing. The maximum current that can be supplied by an alternator depends upon
the maximum heating loss that can be sustained in the armature. This heating loss (which is an I2R power
loss) acts to heat the conductors, and if excessive, destroys the insulation. Thus, alternators are rated in
terms of this current and in terms of the voltage output — the alternator rating in small units is in volt-
amperes; in large units it is kilovolt-amperes.
</p><p class="paragraph">When an alternator leaves the factory, it is already destined to do a very specific job. The speed at
which it is designed to rotate, the voltage it will produce, the current limits, and other operating
characteristics are built in. This information is usually stamped on a nameplate on the case so that the user
will know the limitations.
</p><p class="question"> Q6. How are alternators usually rated?
 Q7. What type of prime mover requires a specially designed high-speed alternator?
 Q8. Salient-pole rotors may be used in alternators driven by what types of prime movers?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SINGLE-PHASE-ALTERNATORS-3-7-">SINGLE-PHASE ALTERNATORS
</h2><p class="paragraph">A generator that produces a single, continuously alternating voltage is known as a SINGLE-PHASE
alternator. All of the alternators that have been discussed so far fit this definition. The stator (armature)
windings are connected in series. The individual voltages, therefore, add to produce a single-phase ac
voltage. Figure 3-5 shows a basic alternator with its single-phase output voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">The definition of phase as you learned it in studying ac circuits may not help too much right here.
Remember, "out of phase" meant "out of time."
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, it may be easier to think of the word phase as meaning voltage as in single voltage. The need
for a modified definition of phase in this usage will be easier to see as we go along.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Single-phase alternators are found in many applications. They are most often used when the loads
being driven are relatively light. The reason for this will be more apparent as we get into multiphase
alternators (also called polyphase).
</p><p class="paragraph">Power that is used in homes, shops, and ships to operate portable tools and small appliances is
single-phase power. Single-phase power alternators always generate single-phase power. However, all
single-phase power does not come from single-phase alternators. This will sound more reasonable to you
as we get into the next subjects.
</p><p class="question"> Q9. What does the term single phase indicate?
 Q10. In single-phase alternators, in order for the voltages induced in all the armature windings to add
</p><p class="paragraph">together for a single output, how must the windings be connected?
TWO-PHASE ALTERNATORS
</p><p class="paragraph">Two phase implies two voltages if we apply our new definition of phase. And, it’s that simple. A
two-phase alternator is designed to produce two completely separate voltages. Each voltage, by itself,
may be considered as a single-phase voltage. Each is generated completely independent of the other.
Certain advantages are gained. These and the mechanics of generation will be covered in the following
paragraphs.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Generation of Two-Phase Power
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-6 shows a simplified two-pole, two-phase alternator. Note that the windings of the two
phases are physically at right angles (90º ) to each other. You would expect the outputs of each phase to
be 90º  apart, which they are. The graph shows the two phases to be 90º  apart, with A leading B. Note
that by using our original definition of phase (from previous modules), we could say that A and B are 90º 
out of phase. There will always be 90º  between the phases of a two-phase alternator. This is by design.

</p><p class="paragraph">Now, let’s go back and see the similarities and differences between our original (single-phase)
alternators and this new one (two-phase). Note that the principles applied are not new. This alternator
works the same as the others we have discussed.
</p><p class="paragraph">The stator in figure 3-6 consists of two single-phase windings completely separated from each other.
Each winding is made up of two windings that are connected in series so that their voltages add. The rotor
is identical to that used in the single-phase alternator. In the left-hand schematic, the rotor poles are
opposite all the windings of phase A. Therefore, the voltage induced in phase A is maximum, and the
voltage induced in phase B is zero. As the rotor continues rotating counterclockwise, it moves away from
the A windings and approaches the B windings. As a result, the voltage induced in phase A decreases
from its maximum value, and the voltage induced in phase B increases from zero. In the right-hand
schematic, the rotor poles are opposite the windings of phase B. Now the voltage induced in phase B is
maximum, whereas the voltage induced in phase A has dropped to zero. Notice that a 90-degree rotation
of the rotor corresponds to one-quarter of a cycle, or 90 electrical degrees. The waveform picture shows
the voltages induced in phase A and B for one cycle. The two voltages are 90º  out of phase. Notice that
the two outputs, A and B, are independent of each other. Each output is a single-phase voltage, just as if
the other did not exist.
</p><p class="paragraph">The obvious advantage, so far, is that we have two separate output voltages. There is some saving in
having one set of bearings, one rotor, one housing, and so on, to do the work of two. There is the
disadvantage of having twice as many stator coils, which require a larger and more complex stator.
</p><p class="paragraph">The large schematic in figure 3-7 shows four separate wires brought out from the A and B stator
windings. This is the same as in figure 3-6. Notice, however, that the dotted wire now connects one end of
B1 to one end of A2. The effect of making this connection is to provide a new output voltage. This sine-
wave voltage, C in the picture, is larger than either A or B. It is the result of adding the instantaneous
values of phase A and phase B. For this reason it appears exactly half way between A and B. Therefore, C
must lag A by 45º  and lead B by 45º , as shown in the small vector diagram.

</p><p class="paragraph">Now, look at the smaller schematic diagram in figure 3-7. Only three connections have been brought
out from the stator. Electrically, this is the same as the large diagram above it. Instead of being connected
at the output terminals, the B1-A2 connection was made internally when the stator was wired. A two-
phase alternator connected in this manner is called a two-phase, three-wire alternator.
</p><p class="paragraph">The three-wire connection makes possible three different load connections: A and B (across each
phase), and C (across both phases). The output at C is always 1.414 times the voltage of either phase.
These multiple outputs are additional advantages of the two-phase alternator over the single-phase type.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, you can understand why single-phase power doesn’t always come from single-phase
alternators. It can be generated by two-phase alternators as well as other multiphase (polyphase)
alternators, as you will soon see.
</p><p class="paragraph">The two-phase alternator discussed in the preceding paragraphs is seldom seen in actual use.
However, the operation of polyphase alternators is more easily explained using two phases than three
phases. The three-phase alternator, which will be covered next, is by far the most common of all
alternators in use today, both in military and civilian applications.
</p><p class="question"> Q11. What determines the phase relationship between the voltages in a two-phase ac generator?
 Q12. How many voltage outputs are available from a two-phase three-wire alternator?
 Q13. What is the relationship of the voltage at C in figure 3-7 to the voltages at A and B?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THREE-PHASE-ALTERNATOR-3-10-">THREE-PHASE ALTERNATOR
</h2><p class="paragraph">The three-phase alternator, as the name implies, has three single-phase windings spaced such that the
voltage induced in any one phase is displaced by 120º from the other two. A schematic diagram of a
three-phase stator showing all the coils becomes complex, and it is difficult to see what is actually
happening. The simplified schematic of figure 3-8, view A, shows all the windings of each phase lumped
together as one winding. The rotor is omitted for simplicity. The voltage waveforms generated across
each phase are drawn on a graph, phase-displaced 120º  from each other. The three-phase alternator as
shown in this schematic is made up of three single-phase alternators whose generated voltages are out of
phase by 120º . The three phases are independent of each other.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Rather than having six leads coming out of the three-phase alternator, the same leads from each
phase may be connected together to form a wye (Y) connection, as shown in figure 3-8, view B. It is
called a wye connection because, without the neutral, the windings appear as the letter Y, in this case
sideways or upside down.
</p><p class="paragraph">The neutral connection is brought out to a terminal when a single-phase load must be supplied.
Single-phase voltage is available from neutral to A, neutral to B, and neutral to C.
</p><p class="paragraph">In a three-phase, Y-connected alternator, the total voltage, or line voltage, across any two of the three
line leads is the vector sum of the individual phase voltages. Each line voltage is 1.73 times one of the
phase voltages. Because the windings form only one path for current flow between phases, the line and
phase currents are the same (equal).
</p><p class="paragraph">A three-phase stator can also be connected so that the phases are connected end-to-end; it is now
delta connected (fig. 3-8, view C). (Delta because it looks like the Greek letter delta, D .) In the delta
connection, line voltages are equal to phase voltages, but each line current is equal to 1.73 times the phase
current. Both the wye and the delta connections are used in alternators.
</p><p class="paragraph">The majority of all alternators in use in the Navy today are three-phase machines. They are much
more efficient than either two-phase or single-phase alternators.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Three-Phase Connections
</h3><p class="paragraph">The stator coils of three-phase alternators may be joined together in either wye or delta connections,
as shown in figure 3-9. With these connections only three wires come out of the alternator. This allows
convenient connection to three-phase motors or power distribution transformers. It is necessary to use
three-phase transformers or their electrical equivalent with this type of system.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

wye, or a combination of both. If both the primary and secondary are connected in wye, the transformer is
called a wye-wye. If both windings are connected in delta, the transformer is called a delta-delta.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-10 shows single-phase transformers connected delta-delta for operation in a three-phase
system. You will note that the transformer windings are not angled to illustrate the typical delta ( D ) as has
been done with alternator windings. Physically, each transformer in the diagram stands alone. There is no
angular relationship between the windings of the individual transformers. However, if you follow the
connections, you will see that they form an electrical delta. The primary windings, for example, are
connected to each other to form a closed loop. Each of these junctions is fed with a phase voltage from a
three-phase alternator. The alternator may be connected either delta or wye depending on load and voltage
requirements, and the design of the system.

connections of each winding are shorted together. These form the common point of the wye. The opposite
end of each winding is isolated. These ends form the arms of the wye.

phase transformers step the voltage down to 117 volts. These transformers are connected delta-delta as in
figure 3-10. With a delta-delta configuration, the load may be a three-phase device connected to all
phases; or, it may be a single-phase device connected to only one phase.
</p><p class="paragraph">At this point, it is important to remember that such a distribution system includes everything between
the alternator and the load. Because of the many choices that three-phase systems provide, care must be
taken to ensure that any change of connections does not provide the load with the wrong voltage or the
wrong phase.

</h2><p class="paragraph">As we have seen before, when the load on a generator is changed, the terminal voltage varies. The
amount of variation depends on the design of the generator.
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltage regulation of an alternator is the change of voltage from full load to no load, expressed
as a percentage of full-load volts, when the speed and dc field current are held constant.

</p><p class="paragraph">depends mainly on three things: (1) the number of conductors in series per winding, (2) the speed
(alternator rpm) at which the magnetic field cuts the winding, and (3) the strength of the magnetic field.
Any of these three factors could be used to control the amount of voltage induced in the alternator
windings.
</p><p class="paragraph">The number of windings, of course, is fixed when the alternator is manufactured. Also, if the output
frequency is required to be of a constant value, then the speed of the rotating field must be held constant.
This prevents the use of the alternator rpm as a means of controlling the voltage output. Thus, the only
practical method for obtaining voltage control is to control the strength of the rotating magnetic field. The
strength of this electromagnetic field may be varied by changing the amount of current flowing through
the field coil. This is accomplished by varying the amount of voltage applied across the field cod.
</p><p class="question"> Q20. How is output voltage controlled in practical alternators?
PARALLEL OPERATION OF ALTERNATORS
</p><p class="paragraph">Alternators are connected in parallel to (1) increase the output capacity of a system beyond that of a
single unit, (2) serve as additional reserve power for expected demands, or (3) permit shutting down one
machine and cutting in a standby machine without interrupting power distribution. When alternators are
of sufficient size, and are operating at different frequencies and terminal voltages, severe damage may
result if they are suddenly connected to each other through a common bus. To avoid this, the machines
must be synchronized as closely as possible before connecting them together. This may be accomplished
by connecting one generator to the bus (referred to as bus generator), and then synchronizing the other
(incoming generator) to it before closing the incoming generator’s main power contactor. The generators
are synchronized when the following conditions are set:
</p><p class="paragraph"> 1. Equal terminal voltages. This is obtained by adjustment of the incoming generator’s field
strength.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 2. Equal frequency. This is obtained by adjustment of the incoming generator’s prime-mover
speed.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 3. Phase voltages in proper phase relation. The procedure for synchronizing generators is not
discussed in this chapter. At this point, it is enough for you to know that the above must be
accomplished to prevent damage to the machines.

operation?

full output voltage; this rating is expressed as the product of the voltage times the current. A 10-volt

Most of the power-generating systems, ashore and afloat, produce ac. For this reason a majority of
</p><p class="paragraph">the motors used throughout the Navy are designed to operate on ac. There are other advantages in the use
of ac motors besides the wide availability of ac power. In general, ac motors cost less than dc motors.
Some types of ac motors do not use brushes and commutators. This eliminates many problems of
maintenance and wear. It also eliminates the problem of dangerous sparking.
</p><p class="paragraph">An ac motor is particularly well suited for constant-speed applications. This is because its speed is
determined by the frequency of the ac voltage applied to the motor terminals.
</p><p class="paragraph">The dc motor is better suited than an ac motor for some uses, such as those that require variable-
speeds. An ac motor can also be made with variable speed characteristics but only within certain limits.
</p><p class="paragraph">Industry builds ac motors in different sizes, shapes, and ratings for many different types of jobs.
These motors are designed for use with either polyphase or single-phase power systems. It is not possible
here to cover all aspects of the subject of ac motors. Only the principles of the most commonly used types
are dealt with in this chapter.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In this chapter, ac motors will be divided into (1) series, (2) synchronous, and (3) induction motors.
Single-phase and polyphase motors will be discussed. Synchronous motors, for purposes of this chapter,
may be considered as polyphase motors, of constant speed, whose rotors are energized with dc voltage.
Induction motors, single-phase or polyphase, whose rotors are energized by induction, are the most
commonly used ac motor. The series ac motor, in a sense, is a familiar type of motor. It is very similar to
the dc motor that was covered in chapter 2 and will serve as a bridge between the old and the new.
</p><p class="question"> Q1. What are the three basic types of ac motors?
</p><p class="paragraph">SERIES AC MOTOR
A series ac motor is the same electrically as a dc series motor. Refer to figure 4-1 and use the left-
</p><p class="paragraph">hand rule for the polarity of coils. You can see that the instantaneous magnetic polarities of the armature
and field oppose each other, and motor action results. Now, reverse the current by reversing the polarity
of the input. Note that the field magnetic polarity still opposes the armature magnetic polarity. This is
because the reversal effects both the armature and the field. The ac input causes these reversals to take
place continuously.
</p><p class="paragraph">The construction of the ac series motor differs slightly from the dc series motor. Special metals,
laminations, and windings are used. They reduce losses caused by eddy currents, hysteresis, and high
reactance. Dc power can be used to drive an ac series motor efficiently, but the opposite is not true.
</p><p class="paragraph">The characteristics of a series ac motor are similar to those of a series dc motor. It is a varying-speed
machine. It has low speeds for large loads and high speeds for light loads. The starting torque is very</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">high. Series motors are used for driving fans, electric drills, and other small appliances. Since the series ac
motor has the same general characteristics as the series dc motor, a series motor has been designed that
can operate both on ac and dc. This ac/dc motor is called a universal motor. It finds wide use in small
electric appliances. Universal motors operate at lower efficiency than either the ac or dc series motor.
They are built in small sizes only. Universal motors do not operate on polyphase ac power.
</p><p class="question"> Q2. Series motors are generally used to operate what type of equipment?
 Q3. Why are series motors sometimes called universal motors?
</p><p class="paragraph">ROTATING MAGNETIC FIELDS
The principle of rotating magnetic fields is the key to the operation of most ac motors. Both
</p><p class="paragraph">synchronous and induction types of motors rely on rotating magnetic fields in their stators to cause their
rotors to turn.
</p><p class="paragraph">The idea is simple. A magnetic field in a stator can be made to rotate electrically, around and around.
Another magnetic field in the rotor can be made to chase it by being attracted and repelled by the stator
field. Because the rotor is free to turn, it follows the rotating magnetic field in the stator. Let’s see how it
is done.
</p><p class="paragraph">Rotating magnetic fields may be set up in two-phase or three-phase machines. To establish a rotating
magnetic field in a motor stator, the number of pole pairs must be the same as (or a multiple of) the
number of phases in the applied voltage. The poles must then be displaced from each other by an angle
equal to the phase angle between the individual phases of the applied voltage.
</p><p class="question"> Q4. What determines the number of field poles required to establish a rotating magnetic field in a
multiphase motor stator?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TWO-PHASE-ROTATING-MAGNETIC-FIELD-4-3-">TWO-PHASE ROTATING MAGNETIC FIELD
</h2><p class="paragraph">A rotating magnetic field is probably most easily seen in a two-phase stator. The stator of a two-
phase induction motor is made up of two windings (or a multiple of two). They are placed at right angles
to each other around the stator. The simplified drawing in figure 4-2 illustrates a two-phase stator.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">If the voltages applied to phases 1-1A and 2-2A are 90º out of phase, the currents that flow in the
phases are displaced from each other by 90º . Since the magnetic fields generated in the coils are in phase
with their respective currents, the magnetic fields are also 90º  out of phase with each other. These two
out-of-phase magnetic fields, whose coil axes are at right angles to each other, add together at every
instant during their cycle. They produce a resultant field that rotates one revolution for each cycle of ac.
</p><p class="paragraph">To analyze the rotating magnetic field in a two-phase stator, refer to figure 4-3. The arrow represents
the rotor. For each point set up on the voltage chart, consider that current flows in a direction that will
cause the magnetic polarity indicated at each pole piece. Note that from one point to the next, the
polarities are rotating from one pole to the next in a clockwise manner. One complete cycle of input
voltage produces a 360-degree rotation of the pole polarities. Let's see how this result is obtained.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

(because the phase voltage is maximum). The current flow and magnetic field in winding 2-2A is zero
(because the phase voltage is zero). The resultant magnetic field is therefore in the direction of the 1-1A
axis. At the 45-degree point (position 2), the resultant magnetic field lies midway between windings 1-1A
and 2-2A. The coil currents and magnetic fields are equal in strength. At 90º  (position 3), the magnetic
field in winding 1-1A is zero. The magnetic field in winding 2-2A is at maximum. Now the resultant
magnetic field lies along the axis of the 2-2A winding as shown. The resultant magnetic field has rotated
clockwise through 90º  to get from position 1 to position 3. When the two-phase voltages have completed
one full cycle (position 9), the resultant magnetic field has rotated through 360º . Thus, by placing two
windings at right angles to each other and exciting these windings with voltages 90º  out of phase, a
rotating magnetic field results.

ROTOR BEHAVIOR IN A ROTATING FIELD
</p><p class="paragraph">For purposes of explaining rotor movement, let's assume that we can place a bar magnet in the center
of the stator diagrams of figure 4-5. We'll mount this magnet so that it is free to rotate in this area. Let's
also assume that the bar magnet is aligned so that at point 1 its south pole is opposite the large N of the
stator field.
</p><p class="paragraph">You can see that this alignment is natural. Unlike poles attract, and the two fields are aligned so that
they are attracting. Now, go from point 1 through point 7. As before, the stator field rotates clockwise.

</p><p class="paragraph">continues to exist. A shaft running through the pivot point of the bar magnet would rotate at the same
speed as the rotating field. This speed is known as synchronous speed. The shaft represents the shaft of an
operating motor to which the load is attached.
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember, this explanation is an oversimplification. It is meant to show how a rotating field can
cause mechanical rotation of a shaft. Such an arrangement would work, but it is not used. There are
limitations to a permanent magnet rotor. Practical motors use other methods, as we shall see in the next
paragraphs.
</p><h3 class="subsection">SYNCHRONOUS MOTORS
The construction of the synchronous motors is essentially the same as the construction of the salient-
</h3><p class="paragraph">pole alternator. In fact, such an alternator may be run as an ac motor. It is similar to the drawing in figure
4-6. Synchronous motors have the characteristic of constant speed between no load and full load. They
are capable of correcting the low power factor of an inductive load when they are operated under certain
conditions. They are often used to drive dc generators. Synchronous motors are designed in sizes up to
thousands of horsepower. They may be designed as either single-phase or multiphase machines. The
discussion that follows is based on a three-phase design.
</p><p class="paragraph">To understand how the synchronous motor works, assume that the application of three-phase ac
power to the stator causes a rotating magnetic field to be set up around the rotor. The rotor is energized
with dc (it acts like a bar magnet). The strong rotating magnetic field attracts the strong rotor field
activated by the dc. This results in a strong turning force on the rotor shaft. The rotor is therefore able to
turn a load as it rotates in step with the rotating magnetic field.
</p><p class="paragraph">It works this way once it’s started. However, one of the disadvantages of a synchronous motor is that
it cannot be started from a standstill by applying three-phase ac power to the stator. When ac is applied to
the stator, a high-speed rotating magnetic field appears immediately. This rotating field rushes past the
rotor poles so quickly that the rotor does not have a chance to get started. In effect, the rotor is repelled
first in one direction and then the other. A synchronous motor in its purest form has no starting torque. It
has torque only when it is running at synchronous speed.
</p><p class="paragraph">A squirrel-cage type of winding is added to the rotor of a synchronous motor to cause it to start. The
squirrel cage is shown as the outer part of the rotor in figure 4-7. It is so named because it is shaped and
looks something like a turnable squirrel cage. Simply, the windings are heavy copper bars shorted</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">together by copper rings. A low voltage is induced in these shorted windings by the rotating three-phase
stator field. Because of the short circuit, a relatively large current flows in the squirrel cage. This causes a
magnetic field that interacts with the rotating field of the stator. Because of the interaction, the rotor
begins to turn, following the stator field; the motor starts. We will run into squirrel cages again in other
applications, where they will be covered in more detail.
</p><p class="paragraph">To start a practical synchronous motor, the stator is energized, but the dc supply to the rotor field is
not energized. The squirrel-cage windings bring the rotor to near synchronous speed. At that point, the dc
field is energized. This locks the rotor in step with the rotating stator field. Full torque is developed, and
the load is driven. A mechanical switching device that operates on centrifugal force is often used to apply
dc to the rotor as synchronous speed is reached.
</p><p class="paragraph">The practical synchronous motor has the disadvantage of requiring a dc exciter voltage for the rotor.
This voltage may be obtained either externally or internally, depending on the design of the motor.
</p><p class="question"> Q7. What requirement is the synchronous motor specifically designed to meet?
</p><p class="paragraph">INDUCTION MOTORS
The induction motor is the most commonly used type of ac motor. Its simple, rugged construction
</p><p class="paragraph">costs relatively little to manufacture. The induction motor has a rotor that is not connected to an external
source of voltage. The induction motor derives its name from the fact that ac voltages are induced in the
rotor circuit by the rotating magnetic field of the stator. In many ways, induction in this motor is similar
to the induction between the primary and secondary windings of a transformer.
</p><p class="paragraph">Large motors and permanently mounted motors that drive loads at fairly constant speed are often
induction motors. Examples are found in washing machines, refrigerator compressors, bench grinders,
and table saws.
</p><p class="paragraph">The stator construction of the three-phase induction motor and the three-phase synchronous motor
are almost identical. However, their rotors are completely different (see fig. 4-8). The induction rotor is
made of a laminated cylinder with slots in its surface. The windings in these slots are one of two types
(shown in fig. 4-9). The most common is the squirrel-cage winding. This entire winding is made up of</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

wound rotor.

small.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you know from Lenz’s law, any induced emf tries to oppose the changing field that induces it. In
the case of an induction motor, the changing field is the motion of the resultant stator field. A force is
exerted on the rotor by the induced emf and the resultant magnetic field. This force tends to cancel the
relative motion between the rotor and the stator field. The rotor, as a result, moves in the same direction
as the rotating stator field.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is impossible for the rotor of an induction motor to turn at the same speed as the rotating magnetic
field. If the speeds were the same, there would be no relative motion between the stator and rotor fields;
without relative motion there would be no induced voltage in the rotor. In order for relative motion to
exist between the two, the rotor must rotate at a speed slower than that of the rotating magnetic field. The.
difference between the speed of the rotating stator field and the rotor speed is called slip. The smaller the
slip, the closer the rotor speed approaches the stator field speed.
</p><p class="paragraph">The speed of the rotor depends upon the torque requirements of the load. The bigger the load, the
stronger the turning force needed to rotate the rotor. The turning force can increase only if the rotor-
induced emf increases. This emf can increase only if the magnetic field cuts through the rotor at a faster
rate. To increase the relative speed between the field and rotor, the rotor must slow down. Therefore, for
heavier loads the induction motor turns slower than for lighter loads. You can see from the previous
statement that slip is directly proportional to the load on the motor. Actually only a slight change in speed
is necessary to produce the usual current changes required for normal changes in load. This is because the
rotor windings have such a low resistance. As a result, induction motors are called constant-speed motors.

types put together.

The single-phase ac induction motor fits that description.
</p><p class="paragraph">Unlike polyphase induction motors, the stator field in the single-phase motor does not rotate. Instead
it simply alternates polarity between poles as the ac voltage changes polarity.
</p><p class="paragraph">Voltage is induced in the rotor as a result of magnetic induction, and a magnetic field is produced
around the rotor. This field will always be in opposition to the stator field (Lenz’s law applies). The
interaction between the rotor and stator fields will not produce rotation, however. The interaction is
shown by the double-ended arrow in figure 4-10, view A. Because this force is across the rotor and
through the pole pieces, there is no rotary motion, just a push and/or pull along this line.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Now, if the rotor is rotated by some outside force (a twist of your hand, or something), the push-pull
along the line in figure 4-10, view A, is disturbed. Look at the fields as shown in figure 4-10, view B. At
this instant the south pole on the rotor is being attracted by the left-hand pole. The north rotor pole is
being attracted to the right-hand pole. All of this is a result of the rotor being rotated 90º  by the outside
force. The pull that now exists between the two fields becomes a rotary force, turning the rotor toward
magnetic correspondence with the stator. Because the two fields continuously alternate, they will never
actually line up, and the rotor will continue to turn once started. It remains for us to learn practical
methods of getting the rotor to start.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are several types of single-phase induction motors in use today. Basically they are identical
except for the means of starting. In this chapter we will discuss the split-phase and shaded-pole motors; so
named because of the methods employed to get them started. Once they are up to operating speed, all
single-phase induction motors operate the same.
</p><p class="question"> Q11. What type of ac motor is most widely used?
Split-Phase Induction Motors
</p><p class="paragraph">One type of induction motor, which incorporates a starting device, is called a split-phase induction
motor. Split-phase motors are designed to use inductance, capacitance, or resistance to develop a starting
torque. The principles are those that you learned in your study of alternating current.
</p><p class="paragraph">CAPACITOR-START.—The first type of split-phase induction motor that will be covered is the
capacitor-start type. Figure 4-11 shows a simplified schematic of a typical capacitor-start motor. The
stator consists of the main winding and a starting winding (auxiliary). The starting winding is connected
in parallel with the main winding and is placed physically at right angles to it. A 90-degree electrical</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">4-13
</p><p class="paragraph">phase difference between the two windings is obtained by connecting the auxiliary winding in series with
a capacitor and starting switch. When the motor is first energized, the starting switch is closed. This
places the capacitor in series with the auxiliary winding. The capacitor is of such value that the auxiliary
circuit is effectively a resistive-capacitive circuit (referred to as capacitive reactance and expressed as
XC). In this circuit the current leads the line voltage by about 45º  (because X C about equals R). The main
winding has enough resistance-inductance (referred to as inductive reactance and expressed as XL) to
cause the current to lag the line voltage by about 45º  (because X
</p><p class="paragraph"> L about equals R). The currents in each
winding are therefore 90º  out of phase - so are the magnetic fields that are generated. The effect is that
the two windings act like a two-phase stator and produce the rotating field required to start the motor.
</p><p class="paragraph">When nearly full speed is obtained, a centrifugal device (the starting switch) cuts out the starting
winding. The motor then runs as a plain single-phase induction motor. Since the auxiliary winding is only
a light winding, the motor does not develop sufficient torque to start heavy loads. Split-phase motors,
therefore, come only in small sizes.
</p><p class="paragraph">RESISTANCE-START.—Another type of split-phase induction motor is the resistance-start motor.
This motor also has a starting winding (shown in fig. 4-12) in addition to the main winding. It is switched
in and out of the circuit just as it was in the capacitor-start motor. The starting winding is positioned at
right angles to the main winding. The electrical phase shift between the currents in the two windings is
obtained by making the impedance of the windings unequal. The main winding has a high inductance and
a low resistance. The current, therefore, lags the voltage by a large angle. The starting winding is
designed to have a fairly low inductance and a high resistance. Here the current lags the voltage by a
smaller angle. For example, suppose the current in the main winding lags the voltage by 70º.  The current
in the auxiliary winding lags the voltage by 40º. The currents are, therefore, out of phase by 30º. The
magnetic fields are out of phase by the same amount. Although the ideal angular phase difference is 90º 
for maximum starting torque, the 30-degree phase difference still generates a rotating field. This supplies
enough torque to start the motor. When the motor comes up to speed, a speed-controlled switch
disconnects the starting winding from the line, and the motor continues to run as an induction motor. The
starting torque is not as great as it is in the capacitor-start.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="question"> Q12. How do split-phase induction motors become self-starting?
Shaded-Pole Induction Motors
</p><p class="paragraph">The shaded-pole induction motor is another single-phase motor. It uses a unique method to start the
rotor turning. The effect of a moving magnetic field is produced by constructing the stator in a special
way. This motor has projecting pole pieces just like some dc motors. In addition, portions of the pole
piece surfaces are surrounded by a copper strap called a shading coil. A pole piece with the strap in place
is shown in figure 4-13. The strap causes the field to move back and forth across the face of the pole
piece. Note the numbered sequence and points on the magnetization curve in the figure. As the alternating
stator field starts increasing from zero (1), the lines of force expand across the face of the pole piece and
cut through the strap. A voltage is induced in the strap. The current that results generates a field that
opposes the cutting action (and decreases the strength) of the main field. This produces the following
actions: As the field increases from zero to a maximum at 90º , a large portion of the magnetic lines of
force are concentrated in the unshaded portion of the pole (1). At 90º  the field reaches its maximum
value. Since the lines of force have stopped expanding, no emf is induced in the strap, and no opposing
magnetic field is generated. As a result, the main field is uniformly distributed across the pole (2). From
90º  to 180º , the main field starts decreasing or collapsing inward. The field generated in the strap
opposes the collapsing field. The effect is to concentrate the lines of force in the shaded portion of the
pole face (3). You can see that from 0º  to 180º , the main field has shifted across the pole face from the
unshaded to the shaded portion. From 180º  to 360º , the main field goes through the same change as it did
from 0º  to 180º ; however, it is now in the opposite direction (4). The direction of the field does not affect
the way the shaded pole works. The motion of the field is the same during the second half-cycle as it was
during the first half of the cycle.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

sizes. They drive such devices as fans, clocks, blowers, and electric razors.
</p><p class="question"> Q13. Why are shaded-pole motors used to drive only very small devices?
Speed of Single-Phase Induction Motors
</p><p class="paragraph">The speed of induction motors is dependent on motor design. The synchronous speed (the speed at
which the stator field rotates) is determined by the frequency of the input ac power and the number of
poles in the stator. The greater the number of poles, the slower the synchronous speed. The higher the
frequency of applied voltage, the higher the synchronous speed. Remember, however, that neither
frequency nor number of poles are variables. They are both fixed by the manufacturer.
</p><p class="paragraph">The relationship between poles, frequency, and synchronous speed is as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">where n is the synchronous speed in rpm, f is the frequency of applied voltage in hertz, and p is the
number of poles in the stator.

the number of poles in the original design.
</p><p class="paragraph">As we have seen before, the rotor is never able to reach synchronous speed. If it did, there would be
no voltage induced in the rotor. No torque would be developed. The motor would not operate. The
difference between rotor speed and synchronous speed is called slip. The difference between these two
speeds is not great. For example, a rotor speed of 3400 to 3500 rpm can be expected from a synchronous
speed of 3600 rpm.

producing gain in the order of 10,000.
</p><p class="paragraph">ARMATURE—The windings in which the output voltage is generated in a generator or in which input
current creates a magnetic field that interacts with the main field in a motor. Note: Armature is often
used as being identical with ROTOR. This usage is correct only part of the time. See the text and the
entries under ROTOR and STATOR in this Glossary.
</p><p class="paragraph">ARMATURE LOSSES—Copper losses, eddy current losses, hysteresis losses which act to decrease the
efficiency of armatures.
</p><p class="paragraph">ARMATURE REACTION—The effect, in a dc generator, of current in the annature creating a magnetic
field that distorts the main field and causing a shift in the neutral plane.
</p><p class="paragraph">BRUSHES—Sliding contacts, usually carbon, that make electrical connection to the rotating part of a
motor or generator.

changes ac to dc.
</p><p class="paragraph">COMPENSATING WINDINGS—Windings embedded in slots in pole pieces, connected in series with
the armature, whose magnetic field opposes the armature field and cancels armature reaction.
</p><p class="paragraph">COMPOUND-WOUND MOTORS AND GENERATORS—Machines that have a series field in

produced as in a two-phase motor.
</p><p class="paragraph">COUNTER EMF—The voltage generated within a coil by a moving magnetic field cutting across the
coil itself. This voltage is in opposition (counter) to the moving field that created it. Counter emf is
present in every motor, generator, transformer, or other inductance winding, whenever an alternating
current flows.
</p><p class="paragraph">DELTA—A 3-phase connection in which windings are connected end-to-end, forming a closed loop that

energized by transformer action (induction) from the stator. More induction motors are used than any
other type.
</p><p class="paragraph">INTERPOLES—Small auxiliary poles placed between main field poles, whose magnetic field opposes
the armature field and cancels armature reaction. Interpoles accomplish the same thing as
compensating windings.
</p><p class="paragraph">LAP WINDING—An armature winding in which opposite ends of each coil are connected to adjoining
segments of the commutator so that the windings overlap.
</p><p class="paragraph">LEFT-HAND RULE FOR GENERATORS—A representation of the relationships between motion,
magnetic force, and resultant current in the generation of a voltage. The thumb, forefinger, and
middle finger of the left hand are extended at right angles to each other. The thumb should point in
the direction the conductor moves. The forefinger should point in the direction of magnetic flux from
north to south. The middle finger will then point in the direction the generated voltage forces current
to flow. Any of three quantities may be found if the other two are known.
</p><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC INDUCTION—The generation of a voltage in a circuit by causing relative motion
between a magnetic field and the circuit. The relative motion can be the result of physical movement
or the rise and fall of a magnetic field created by a changing current.
</p><p class="paragraph">MOTOR—A machine that converts electrical energy to mechanical energy. It is activated by ac or dc
voltage, depending on the design.
</p><p class="paragraph">MOTOR LOAD—Any device driven by a motor. Typical loads are drills, saws, water pumps, rotating
antennas, generators, etc. The speed and power capabilities of a motor must be matched to the speed
and power requirements of the motor load.
</p><p class="paragraph">MOTOR REACTION—The force created by generator armature current that tends to oppose normal
rotation of the armature.
</p><p class="paragraph">MOTOR STARTERS—Large resistive devices placed in series with dc motor armatures to prevent the
armature from drawing excessive current until armature speed develops counter emf. The resistance
is gradually removed from the circuit either automatically or manually as motor speed increases.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
