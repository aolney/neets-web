SERIES 
</h2><p class="paragraph"> 
The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in 
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior 
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic 
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure, 
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing 
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or 
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While 
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how 
the individual modules flow together. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history 
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current 
(dc). It also describes some of the general safety precautions and first-aid procedures that should be 
common knowledge for a person working in the field of electricity. Related safety hints are located 
throughout the rest of the series, as well. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 2, Introduction to Alternating Current and Transformers, is an introduction to alternating current 
(ac) and transformers, including basic ac theory and fundamentals of electromagnetism, inductance, 
capacitance, impedance, and transformers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 3, Introduction to Circuit Protection, Control, and Measurement, encompasses circuit breakers, 
fuses, and current limiters used in circuit protection, as well as the theory and use of meters as electrical 
measuring devices. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 4, Introduction to Electrical Conductors, Wiring Techniques, and Schematic Reading,  presents 
conductor usage, insulation used as wire covering, splicing, termination of wiring, soldering, and reading 
electrical wiring diagrams. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 5, Introduction to Generators and Motors, is an introduction to generators and motors, and 
covers the uses of ac and dc generators and motors in the conversion of electrical and mechanical 
energies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 6, Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies, ties the first five modules 
together in an introduction to vacuum tubes and vacuum-tube power supplies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, is similar to module 6, but it is in 
reference to solid-state devices. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 8, Introduction to Amplifiers, covers amplifiers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits, discusses wave generation and 
wave-shaping circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas, presents the 
characteristics of wave propagation, transmission lines, and antennas. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

section. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Although an attempt has been made to use simple language, various technical words and phrases have 
necessarily been included. Specific terms are defined in Module 20, Master Glossary. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Considerable emphasis has been placed on illustrations to provide a maximum amount of information. In 
some instances, a knowledge of basic algebra may be required. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Assignments are provided for each module, with the exceptions of Module 19, The Technician's 
Handbook; and Module 20, Master Glossary. Course descriptions and ordering information are in
