SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current
(dc). It also describes some of the general safety precautions and first-aid procedures that should be

</h2><p class="paragraph">As you recall from previous studies in this series, semiconductors have electrical properties
somewhere between those of insulators and conductors. The use of semiconductor materials in electronic
components is not new; some devices are as old as the electron tube. Two of the most widely known
semiconductors in use today are the JUNCTION DIODE and TRANSISTOR. These semiconductors fall
under a more general heading called solid-state devices. A SOLID-STATE DEVICE is nothing more than
an electronic device, which operates by virtue of the movement of electrons within a solid piece of
semiconductor material.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the invention of the transistor, solid-state devices have been developed and improved at an
unbelievable rate. Great strides have been made in the manufacturing techniques, and there is no
foreseeable limit to the future of these devices. Solid-state devices made from semiconductor materials
offer compactness, efficiency, ruggedness, and versatility. Consequently, these devices have invaded
virtually every field of science and industry. In addition to the junction diode and transistor, a whole new
family of related devices has been developed: the ZENER DIODE, LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE, FIELD
EFFECT TRANSISTOR, etc. One development that has dominated solid-state technology, and probably
has had a greater impact on the electronics industry than either the electron tube or transistor, is the
INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. The integrated circuit is a minute piece of semiconductor material that can
produce complete electronic circuit functions.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">As the applications of solid-state devices mount, the need for knowledge of these devices becomes
increasingly important. Personnel in the Navy today will have to understand solid-state devices if they are
to become proficient in the repair and maintenance of electronic equipment. Therefore, our objective in
this module is to provide a broad coverage of solid-state devices and, as a broad application, power
supplies. We will begin our discussion with some background information on the development of the
semiconductor. We will then proceed to the semiconductor diode, the transistor, special devices and,
finally, solid-state power supplies.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SEMICONDUCTOR-DEVELOPMENT-1-2-">SEMICONDUCTOR DEVELOPMENT
</h2><p class="paragraph">Although the semiconductor was late in reaching its present development, its story began long before
the electron tube. Historically, we can go as far back as 1883 when Michael Faraday discovered that
silver sulfide, a semiconductor, has a negative temperature coefficient. The term negative temperature
coefficient is just another way of saying its resistance to electrical current flow decreases as temperature
increases. The opposite is true of the conductor. It has a positive temperature coefficient. Because of this
particular characteristic, semiconductors are used extensively in power-measuring equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">Only 2 years later, another valuable characteristic was reported by Munk A. Rosenshold. He found
that certain materials have rectifying properties. Strange as it may seem, his finding was given such little
notice that it had to be rediscovered 39 years later by F. Braun.
</p><p class="paragraph">Toward the close of the 19th century, experimenters began to notice the peculiar characteristics of
the chemical element SELENIUM. They discovered that in addition to its rectifying properties (the ability
to convert ac into dc), selenium was also light sensitive-its resistance decreased with an increase in light
intensity. This discovery eventually led to the invention of the photophone by Alexander Graham Bell.
The photophone, which converted variations of light into sound, was a predecessor of the radio receiver;
however, it wasn’t until the actual birth of radio that selenium was used to any extent. Today, selenium is
an important and widely used semiconductor.
</p><p class="paragraph">Many other materials were tried and tested for use in communications. SILICON was found to be the
most stable of the materials tested while GALENA, a crystalline form of lead sulfide, was found the most
sensitive for use in early radio receivers. By 1915, Carl Beredicks discovered that GERMANIUM,
another metallic element, also had rectifying capabilities. Later, it became widely used in electronics for
low-power, low-frequency applications.
</p><p class="paragraph">Although the semiconductor was known long before the electron tube was invented, the
semiconductor devices of that time could not match the performance of the tube. Radio needed a device
that could not only handle power and amplify but rectify and detect a signal as well. Since tubes could do
all these things, whereas semiconductor devices of that day could not, the semiconductor soon lost out.
</p><p class="paragraph">It wasn’t until the beginning of World War II that interest was renewed in the semiconductor. There
was a dire need for a device that could work within the ultra-high frequencies of radar. Electron tubes had
interelectrode capacitances that were too high to do the job. The point-contact semiconductor diode, on
the other hand, had a very low internal capacitance. Consequently, it filled the bill; it could be designed to
work within the ultra-high frequencies used in radar, whereas the electron tube could not.
</p><p class="paragraph">As radar took on greater importance and communication-electronic equipment became more
sophisticated, the demands for better solid-state devices mounted. The limitations of the electron tube
made necessary a quest for something new and different. An amplifying device was needed that was
smaller, lighter, more efficient, and capable of handling extremely high frequencies. This was asking a</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">lot, but if progress was to be made, these requirements had to be met. A serious study of semiconductor
materials began in the early 1940’s and has continued since.
</p><p class="paragraph">In June 1948, a significant breakthrough took place in semiconductor development. This was the
discovery of POINT-CONTACT TRANSISTOR. Here at last was a semiconductor that could amplify.
This discovery brought the semiconductor back into competition with the electron tube. A year later,
JUNCTION DIODES and TRANSISTORS were developed. The junction transistor was found superior to
the point-contact type in many respects. By comparison, the junction transistor was more reliable,
generated less noise, and had higher power-handling ability than its point-contact brother. The junction
transistor became a rival of the electron tube in many uses previously uncontested.
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor diodes were not to be slighted. The initial work of Dr. Carl Zener led to the
development of ZENER DIODE, which is frequently used today to regulate power supply voltages at
precise levels. Considerably more interest in the solid-state diode was generated when Dr. Leo Esaki, a
Japanese scientist, fabricated a diode that could amplify. The device, named the TUNNEL DIODE, has
amazing gain and fast switching capabilities. Although it is used in the conventional amplifying and
oscillating circuits, its primary use is in computer logic circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another breakthrough came in the late 1950’s when it was discovered that semiconductor materials
could be combined and treated so that they functioned as an entire circuit or subassembly rather than as a
circuit component. Many names have been given to this solid-circuit concept, such as INTEGRATED
CIRCUITS, MICROELECTRONICS, and MICROCIRCUITRY.
</p><p class="paragraph">So as we see, in looking back, that the semiconductor is not something new, but it has come a long
way in a short time.
</p><p class="question"> Q1. What is a solid-state device?
 Q2. Define the term negative temperature coefficient.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SEMICONDUCTOR-APPLICATIONS-1-3-">SEMICONDUCTOR APPLICATIONS
</h2><p class="paragraph">In the previous paragraphs, we mentioned just a few of the many different applications of
semiconductor devices. The use of these devices has become so widespread that it would be impossible to
list all their different applications. Instead, a broad coverage of their specific application is presented.
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor devices are all around us. They can be found in just about every commercial product
we touch, from the family car to the pocket calculator. Semiconductor devices are contained in television
sets, portable radios, stereo equipment, and much more.
</p><p class="paragraph">Science and industry also rely heavily on semiconductor devices. Research laboratories use these
devices in all sorts of electronic instruments to perform tests, measurements, and numerous other
experimental tasks. Industrial control systems (such as those used to manufacture automobiles) and
automatic telephone exchanges also use semiconductors. Even today heavy-duty versions of the solid-
state rectifier diode are being use to convert large amounts of power for electric railroads. Of the many
different applications for solid-state devices, space systems, computers, and data processing equipment
are some of the largest consumers.

devices would make a long impressive list. The fact is, semiconductors are being used extensively in
commercial products, industry, and the military.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SEMICONDUCTOR-COMPETITION-1-4-">SEMICONDUCTOR COMPETITION
</h2><p class="paragraph">It should not be difficult to conclude, from what you already know, that semiconductor devices can
and do perform all the conventional functions of rectification, amplification, oscillation, timing,
switching, and sensing. Simply stated, these devices perform the same basic functions as the electron
tube; but they perform more efficiently, economically, and for a longer period of time. Therefore, it
should be no surprise to you to see these devices used in place of electron tubes. Keeping this in mind, we
see that it is only natural and logical to compare semiconductor devices with electron tubes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Physically, semiconductor devices are much smaller than tubes. You can see in figure 1-1 that the
difference is quite evident. This illustration shows some commonly used tube sizes alongside
semiconductor devices of similar capabilities. The reduction in size can be as great as 100:1 by weight
and 1000:1 by volume. It is easy to see that size reduction favors the semiconductor device. Therefore,
whenever miniaturization is required or is convenient, transistors are favored over tubes. Bear in mind,
however, that the extent of practical size reduction is a big factor; many things must be considered.
Miniature electron tubes, for example, may be preferred in certain applications to transistors, thus keeping
size reduction to a competitive area.
</p><p class="paragraph">Power is also a two-sided story. For low-power applications, where efficiency is a significant factor,
semiconductors have a decided advantage. This is true mainly because semiconductor devices perform
very well with an extremely small amount of power; in addition, they require no filaments or heaters as in
the case of the electron tube. For example, a computer operating with over 4000 solid-state devices may
require no more than 20 watts of power. However, the same number of tubes would require several
kilowatts of power.
</p><p class="paragraph">For high-power applications, it is a different story — tubes have the upper hand. The high-power
tube has no equivalent in any semiconductor device. This is because a tube can be designed to operate</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">with over a thousand volts applied to its plate whereas the maximum allowable voltage for a transistor is
limited to about 200 volts (usually 50 volts or less). A tube can also handle thousands of watts of power.
The maximum power output for transistor generally ranges from 30 milliwatts to slightly over 100 watts.
</p><p class="paragraph">When it comes to ruggedness and life expectancy, the tube is still in competition. Design and
functional requirements usually dictate the choice of device. However, semiconductor devices are rugged
and long-lived. They can be constructed to withstand extreme vibration and mechanical shock. They have
been known to withstand impacts that would completely shatter an ordinary electron tube. Although some
specially designed tubes render extensive service, the life expectancy of transistors is better than three to
four times that of ordinary electronic tubes. There is no known failure mechanism (such as an open
filament in a tube) to limit the semiconductor’s life. However, semiconductor devices do have some
limitations. They are usually affected more by temperature, humidity, and radiation than tubes are.
</p><p class="question"> Q3. Name three of the largest users of semiconductor devices.
 Q4. State one requirement of an electron tube, which does not exist for semiconductors, that makes the
</p><p class="paragraph">tube less efficient than the semiconductor.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SEMICONDUCTOR-THEORY-1-5-">SEMICONDUCTOR THEORY
</h2><p class="paragraph">To understand why solid-state devices function as they do, we will have to examine closely the
composition and nature of semiconductors. This entails theory that is fundamental to the study of solid-
state devices.
</p><p class="paragraph">Rather than beginning with theory, let’s first become reacquainted with some of the basic
information you studied earlier concerning matter and energy (NEETS, Module 1).
ATOMIC STRUCTURE
</p><p class="paragraph">The universe, as we know it today, is divided into two parts: matter and energy. Matter, which is our
main concern at this time, is anything that occupies space and has weight. Rocks, water, air, automobiles,
clothing, and even our own bodies are good examples of matter. From this, we can conclude that matter
may be found in any one of three states: SOLIDS, LIQUIDS, and GASES. All matter is composed of
either an element or combination of elements. As you know, an element is a substance that cannot be
reduced to a simpler form by chemical means. Examples of elements with which you are in contact
everyday are iron, gold, silver, copper, and oxygen. At present, there are over 100 known elements of
which all matter is composed.
</p><p class="paragraph">As we work our way down the size scale, we come to the atom, the smallest particle into which an
element can be broken down and still retain all its original properties. The atoms of one element,
however, differ from the atoms of all other elements. Since there are over 100 known elements, there
must be over 100 different atoms, or a different atom for each element.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now let us consider more than one element at a time. This brings us to the term "compound." A
compound is a chemical combination of two or more elements. Water, table salt, ethyl alcohol, and
ammonia are all examples of compounds. The smallest part of a compound, which has all the
characteristics of the compound, is the molecule. Each molecule contains some of the atoms of each of
the elements forming the compound.
</p><p class="paragraph">Consider sugar, for example. Sugar in general terms is matter, since it occupies space and has
weight. It is also a compound because it consists of two or more elements. Take a lump of sugar and crush</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">it into small particles; each of the particles still retains its original identifying properties of sugar. The
only thing that changed was the physical size of the sugar. If we continue this subdividing process by
grinding the sugar into a fine power, the results are the same. Even dissolving sugar in water does not
change its identifying properties, in spite of the fact that the particles of sugar are now too small to be
seen even with a microscope. Eventually, we end up with a quantity of sugar that cannot be further
divided without its ceasing to be sugar. This quantity is known as a molecule of sugar. If the molecule is
further divided, it is found to consist of three simpler kinds of matter: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
These simpler forms are called elements. Therefore, since elements consist of atoms, then a molecule of
sugar is made up of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
</p><p class="paragraph">As we investigate the atom, we find that it is basically composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons.
Furthermore, the electrons, protons, and neutrons of one element are identical to those of any other
element. There are different kinds of elements because the number and the arrangement of electrons and
protons are different for each element.
</p><p class="paragraph">The electron carries a small negative charge of electricity. The proton carries a positive charge of
electricity equal and opposite to the charge of the electron. Scientists have measured the mass and size of
the electron and proton, and they know how much charge each possesses. Both the electron and proton
have the same quantity of charge, although the mass of the proton is approximately 1,827 times that of the
electron. In some atoms there exists a neutral particle called a neutron. The neutron has a mass
approximately equal to that of a proton, but it has no electrical charge.
</p><p class="paragraph">According to theory, the electrons, protons, and neutrons of the atoms are thought to be arranged in a
manner similar to a miniature solar system. Notice the helium atom in figure 1-2. Two protons and two
neutrons form the heavy nucleus with a positive charge around which two very light electrons revolve.
The path each electron takes around the nucleus is called an orbit. The electrons are continuously being
acted upon in their orbits by the force of attraction of the nucleus. To maintain an orbit around the
nucleus, the electrons travel at a speed that produces a counterforce equal to the attraction force of the
nucleus. Just as energy is required to move a space vehicle away from the earth, energy is also required to
move an electron away from the nucleus. Like a space vehicle, the electron is said to be at a higher energy
level when it travels a larger orbit. Scientific experiments have shown that the electron requires a certain
amount of energy to stay in orbit. This quantity is called the electron’s energy level. By virtue of just its
motion alone, the electron contains kinetic energy. Because of its position, it also contains potential
energy. The total energy contained by an electron (kinetic energy plus potential energy) is the main factor
that determines the radius of the electron’s orbit. For an electron to remain in this orbit, it must neither
gain nor lose energy.

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-7
</p><p class="paragraph">The orbiting electrons do not follow random paths, instead they are confined to definite energy
levels. Visualize these levels as shells with each successive shell being spaced a greater distance from the
nucleus. The shells, and the number of electrons required to fill them, may be predicted by using Pauli’s
exclusion principle. Simply stated, this principle specifies that each shell will contain a maximum of 2n2
electrons, where n corresponds to the shell number starting with the one closest to the nucleus. By this
principle, the second shell, for example, would contain 2(2) 2 or 8 electrons when full.
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to being numbered, the shells are also given letter designations starting with the shell
closest to the nucleus and progressing outward as shown in figure 1-3. The shells are considered to be
full, or complete, when they contain the following quantities of electrons: 2 in the K(1st) shell, 8 in the
L(2nd) shell, 18 in the M(3rd) shell, and so on, in accordance with the exclusion principle. Each of these
shells is a major shell and can be divided into subshells, of which there are four, labeled s, p, d, and f.
Like the major shells, the subshells are also limited as to the number of electrons they contain. Thus, the
"s" subshell is complete when it contains 2 electrons, the "p" subshell when it contains 6, the "d" subshell
when it contains 10, and the "f" subshell when it contains 14 electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">Inasmuch as the K shell can contain no more than 2 electrons, it must have only one subshell, the s
subshell. The M shell is composed of three subshells: s, p, and d. If the electrons in the s, p, and d
subshells are added together, their total is found to be 18, the exact number required to fill the M shell.
Notice the electron configuration of copper illustrated in figure 1-4. The copper atom contains 29
electrons, which completely fill the first three shells and subshells, leaving one electron in the "s" subshell
of the N shell. A list of all the other known elements, with the number of electrons in each atom, is
contained in the PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS. The periodic table of elements is included in
appendix 2.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Valence is an atom’s ability to combine with other atoms. The number of electrons in the outermost
shell of an atom determines its valence. For this reason, the outer shell of an atom is called VALENCE
SHELL, and the electrons contained in this shell are called VALENCE ELECTRONS. The valence of an
atom determines its ability to gain or lose an electron, which in turn determines the chemical and
electrical properties of the atom. An atom that is lacking only one or two electrons from its outer shell
will easily gain electrons to complete its shell, but a large amount of energy is required to free any of its
electrons. An atom having a relatively small number of electrons in its outer shell in comparison to the
number of electrons required to fill the shell will easily lose these valence electrons. The valence shell
always refers to the outermost shell.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Now that you have become reacquainted with matter and energy, we will continue our discussion
with electron behavior.
</p><p class="paragraph">As stated earlier, orbiting electrons contain energy and are confined to definite energy levels. The
various shells in an atom represent these levels. Therefore, to move an electron from a lower shell to a
higher shell a certain amount of energy is required. This energy can be in the form of electric fields, heat,
light, and even bombardment by other particles. Failure to provide enough energy to the electron, even if
the energy supplied is just short of the required amount, will cause it to remain at its present energy level.
Supplying more energy than is needed will only cause the electron to move to the next higher shell and
the remaining energy will be wasted. In simple terms, energy is required in definite units to move
electrons from one shell to the next higher shell. These units are called QUANTA (for example 1, 2, or 3
quanta).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Electrons can also lose energy as well as receive it. When an electron loses energy, it moves to a
lower shell. The lost energy, in some cases, appears as heat.
</p><p class="paragraph">If a sufficient amount of energy is absorbed by an electron, it is possible for that electron to be
completely removed from the influence of the atom. This is called IONIZATION. When an atom loses
electrons or gains electrons in this process of electron exchange, it is said to be ionized. For ionization to
take place, there must be a transfer of energy that results in a change in the internal energy of the atom.
An atom having more than its normal amount of electrons acquires a negative charge, and is called a
NEGATIVE ION. The atom that gives up some of its normal electrons is left with fewer negative charges
than positive charges and is called a POSITIVE ION. Thus, we can define ionization as the process by
which an atom loses or gains electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">Up to this point in our discussion, we have spoken only of isolated atoms. When atoms are spaced
far enough apart, as in a gas, they have very little influence upon each other, and are very much like lone
atoms. But atoms within a solid have a marked effect upon each other. The forces that bind these atoms
together greatly modify the behavior of the other electrons. One consequence of this close proximity of
atoms is to cause the individual energy levels of an atom to break up and form bands of energy. Discrete
(separate and complete) energy levels still exist within these energy bands, but there are many more
energy levels than there were with the isolated atom. In some cases, energy levels will have disappeared.
Figure 1-5 shows the difference in the energy arrangement between an isolated atom and the atom in a
solid. Notice that the isolated atom (such as in gas) has energy levels, whereas the atom in a solid has

electrons in this band are easily removed by the application of external electric fields. Materials that have

electrons. Electrons in this band are more tightly bound to the individual atom than the electrons in the
conduction band. However, the electrons in the valence band can still be moved to the conduction band
with the application of energy, usually thermal energy. There are more bands below the valence band, but
they are not important to the understanding of semiconductor theory and will not be discussed.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The concept of energy bands is particularly important in classifying materials as conductors,
semiconductors, and insulators. An electron can exist in either of two energy bands, the conduction band
or the valence band. All that is necessary to move an electron from the valence band to the conduction
band so it can be used for electric current, is enough energy to carry the electron through the forbidden
band. The width of the forbidden band or the separation between the conduction and valence bands
determines whether a substance is an insulator, semiconductor, or conductor. Figure 1-6 uses energy level
diagrams to show the difference between insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.
</p><p class="paragraph">The energy diagram for the insulator shows the insulator with a very wide energy gap. The wider this
gap, the greater the amount of energy required to move the electron from the valence band to the
conduction band. Therefore, an insulator requires a large amount of energy to obtain a small amount of
current. The insulator "insulates" because of the wide forbidden band or energy gap.
</p><p class="paragraph">The semiconductor, on the other hand, has a smaller forbidden band and requires less energy to
move an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Therefore, for a certain amount of
applied voltage, more current will flow in the semiconductor than in the insulator.
</p><p class="paragraph">The last energy level diagram in figure 1-6 is that of a conductor. Notice, there is no forbidden band
or energy gap and the valence and conduction bands overlap. With no energy gap, it takes a small amount
of energy to move electrons into the conduction band; consequently, conductors pass electrons very
easily.

of electrons to complete the shell, then the activity of the atom increases.
</p><p class="paragraph">Silicon and germanium, for example, are the most frequently used semiconductors. Both are quite
similar in their structure and chemical behavior. Each has four electrons in the valence shell. Consider just
silicon. Since it has fewer than the required number of eight electrons needed in the outer shell, its atoms
will unite with other atoms until eight electrons are shared. This gives each atom a total of eight electrons
in its valence shell; four of its own and four that it borrowed from the surrounding atoms. The sharing of
valence electrons between two or more atoms produces a COVALENT BOND between the atoms. It is
this bond that holds the atoms together in an orderly structure called a CRYSTAL. A crystal is just
another name for a solid whose atoms or molecules are arranged in a three-dimensional geometrical
pattern commonly referred to as a lattice. Figure 1-7 shows a typical crystal structure. Each sphere in the
figure represents the nucleus of an atom, and the arms that join the atoms and support the structure are the
covalent bonds.
</p><p class="paragraph">As a result of this sharing process, the valence electrons are held tightly together. This can best be
illustrated by the two-dimensional view of the silicon lattice in figure 1-8. The circles in the figure
represent the nuclei of the atoms. The +4 in the circles is the net charge of the nucleus plus the inner
shells (minus the valence shell). The short lines indicate valence electrons. Because every atom in this
pattern is bonded to four other atoms, the electrons are not free to move within the crystal. As a result of
this bonding, pure silicon and germanium are poor conductors of electricity. The reason they are not
insulators but semiconductors is that with the proper application of heat or electrical pressure, electrons
can be caused to break free of their bonds and move into the conduction band. Once in this band, they
wander aimlessly through the crystal.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CONDUCTION-PROCESS-1-12-">CONDUCTION PROCESS
</h2><p class="paragraph">As stated earlier, energy can be added to electrons by applying heat. When enough energy is
absorbed by the valence electrons, it is possible for them to break some of their covalent bonds. Once the
bonds are broken, the electrons move to the conduction band where they are capable of supporting
electric current. When a voltage is applied to a crystal containing these conduction band electrons, the
electrons move through the crystal toward the applied voltage. This movement of electrons in a
semiconductor is referred to as electron current flow.
</p><p class="paragraph">There is still another type of current in a pure semiconductor. This current occurs when a covalent
bond is broken and a vacancy is left in the atom by the missing valence electron. This vacancy is
commonly referred to as a "hole." The hole is considered to have a positive charge because its atom is
deficient by one electron, which causes the protons to outnumber the electrons. As a result of this hole, a
chain reaction begins when a nearby electron breaks its own covalent bond to fill the hole, leaving another
hole. Then another electron breaks its bond to fill the previous hole, leaving still another hole. Each time
an electron in this process fills a hole, it enters into a covalent bond. Even though an electron has moved
from one covalent bond to another, the most important thing to remember is that the hole is also moving.
Therefore, since this process of conduction resembles the movement of holes rather than electrons, it is
termed hole flow (short for hole current flow or conduction by holes). Hole flow is very similar to
electron flow except that the holes move toward a negative potential and in an opposite direction to that of
the electron. Since hole flow results from the breaking of covalent bonds, which are at the valence band
level, the electrons associated with this type of conduction contain only valence band energy and must
remain in the valence band. However, the electrons associated with electron flow have conduction band
energy and can, therefore, move throughout the crystal. A good analogy of hole flow is the movement of
a hole through a tube filled with balls (figure 1-9).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

2, which leaves still another hole. Ball number 3 then moves into the hole left by ball number 2. This
causes still another hole to appear where ball 3 was. Notice the holes are moving to the right side of the
tube. This action continues until all the balls have moved one space to the left in which time the hole
moved eight spaces to the right and came to rest at the right-hand end of the tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the theory just described, two current carriers were created by the breaking of covalent bonds: the
negative electron and the positive hole. These carriers are referred to as electron-hole pairs. Since the
semiconductor we have been discussing contains no impurities, the number of holes in the electron-hole
pairs is always equal to the number of conduction electrons. Another way of describing this condition
where no impurities exist is by saying the semiconductor is INTRINSIC. The term intrinsic is also used to
distinguish the pure semiconductor that we have been working with from one containing impurities.

yielding a relatively small current flow. A much more efficient method of increasing current flow in
semiconductors is by adding very small amounts of selected additives to them, generally no more than a
few parts per million. These additives are called impurities and the process of adding them to crystals is
referred to as DOPING. The purpose of semiconductor doping is to increase the number of free charges
that can be moved by an external applied voltage. When an impurity increases the number of free
electrons, the doped semiconductor is NEGATIVE or N TYPE, and the impurity that is added is known
as an N-type impurity. However, an impurity that reduces the number of free electrons, causing more</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

— are referred to as EXTRINSIC semiconductors.
</p><h3 class="subsection">N-Type Semiconductor
</h3><p class="paragraph">The N-type impurity loses its extra valence electron easily when added to a semiconductor material,
and in so doing, increases the conductivity of the material by contributing a free electron. This type of
impurity has 5 valence electrons and is called a PENTAVALENT impurity. Arsenic, antimony, bismuth,
and phosphorous are pentavalent impurities. Because these materials give or donate one electron to the
doped material, they are also called DONOR impurities.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a pentavalent (donor) impurity, like arsenic, is added to germanium, it will form covalent
bonds with the germanium atoms. Figure 1-10 illustrates this by showing an arsenic atom (AS) in a
germanium (GE) lattice structure. Notice the arsenic atom in the center of the lattice. It has 5 valence
electrons in its outer shell but uses only 4 of them to form covalent bonds with the germanium atoms,
leaving 1 electron relatively free in the crystal structure. Pure germanium may be converted into an
N-type semiconductor by "doping" it with any donor impurity having 5 valence electrons in its outer
shell. Since this type of semiconductor (N-type) has a surplus of electrons, the electrons are considered
MAJORITY carriers, while the holes, being few in number, are the MINORITY carriers.
</p><h3 class="subsection">P-Type Semiconductor

deficiency of 1 valence electron by acquiring an electron from its neighbor. Impurities of this type have
only 3 valence electrons and are called TRIVALENT impurities. Aluminum, indium, gallium, and boron
are trivalent impurities. Because these materials accept 1 electron from the doped material, they are also
called ACCEPTOR impurities.
</p><p class="paragraph">A trivalent (acceptor) impurity element can also be used to dope germanium. In this case, the
impurity is 1 electron short of the required amount of electrons needed to establish covalent bonds with 4
neighboring atoms. Thus, in a single covalent bond, there will be only 1 electron instead of 2. This
arrangement leaves a hole in that covalent bond. Figure 1-11 illustrates this theory by showing what
happens when germanium is doped with an indium (In) atom. Notice, the indium atom in the figure is 1</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

removal of an electron from a neutral atom, but is created when a trivalent impurity enters into covalent
bonds with a tetravalent (4 valence electrons) crystal structure. The holes in this type of semiconductor

appropriately called the junction.) The usual characteristics of this device make it extremely useful in
electronics as a diode rectifier. The diode rectifier or PN junction diode performs the same function as its
counterpart in electron tubes but in a different way. The diode is nothing more than a two-element
semiconductor device that makes use of the rectifying properties of a PN junction to convert alternating
current into direct current by permitting current flow in only one direction. The schematic symbol of a PN
junction diode is shown in figure 1-12. The vertical bar represents the cathode (N-type material) since it is

</h2><p class="paragraph">Merely pressing together a section of P material and a section of N material, however, is not
sufficient to produce a rectifying junction. The semiconductor should be in one piece to form a proper PN
junction, but divided into a P-type impurity region and an N-type impurity region. This can be done in
various ways. One way is to mix P-type and N-type impurities into a single crystal during the
manufacturing process. By so doing, a P-region is grown over part of a semiconductor’s length and N-
region is grown over the other part. This is called a GROWN junction and is illustrated in view A of
figure 1-13. Another way to produce a PN junction is to melt one type of impurity into a semiconductor
of the opposite type impurity. For example, a pellet of acceptor impurity is placed on a wafer of N-type
germanium and heated. Under controlled temperature conditions, the acceptor impurity fuses into the
wafer to form a P-region within it, as shown in view B of figure 1-13. This type of junction is known as
an ALLOY or FUSED-ALLOY junction, and is one of the most commonly used junctions. In figure 1-14,
a POINT-CONTACT type of construction is shown. It consists of a fine metal wire, called a cat whisker,
that makes contact with a small area on the surface of an N-type semiconductor as shown in view A of the
figure. The PN union is formed in this process by momentarily applying a high-surge current to the wire
and the N-type semiconductor. The heat generated by this current converts the material nearest the point
of contact to a P-type material (view B).

junction. But before we can understand how the PN junction works, we must first consider current flow in
the materials that make up the junction and what happens initially within the junction when these two
materials are joined together.
Current Flow in the N-Type Material
</p><p class="paragraph">Conduction in the N-type semiconductor, or crystal, is similar to conduction in a copper wire. That
is, with voltage applied across the material, electrons will move through the crystal just as current would
flow in a copper wire. This is shown in figure 1-15. The positive potential of the battery will attract the
free electrons in the crystal. These electrons will leave the crystal and flow into the positive terminal of
the battery. As an electron leaves the crystal, an electron from the negative terminal of the battery will
enter the crystal, thus completing the current path. Therefore, the majority current carriers in the N-type
material (electrons) are repelled by the negative side of the battery and move through the crystal toward
the positive side of the battery.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Current Flow in the P-Type Material
</h3><p class="paragraph">Current flow through the P-type material is illustrated in figure 1-16. Conduction in the P material is
by positive holes, instead of negative electrons. A hole moves from the positive terminal of the P material
to the negative terminal. Electrons from the external circuit enter the negative terminal of the material and
fill holes in the vicinity of this terminal. At the positive terminal, electrons are removed from the covalent
bonds, thus creating new holes. This process continues as the steady stream of holes (hole current) moves
toward the negative terminal.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Junction Barrier
</h3><p class="paragraph">Although the N-type material has an excess of free electrons, it is still electrically neutral. This is
because the donor atoms in the N material were left with positive charges after free electrons became
available by covalent bonding (the protons outnumbered the electrons). Therefore, for every free electron
in the N material, there is a corresponding positively charge atom to balance it. The end result is that the
N material has an overall charge of zero.
</p><p class="paragraph">By the same reasoning, the P-type material is also electrically neutral because the excess of holes in
this material is exactly balanced by the number of electrons. Keep in mind that the holes and electrons are
still free to move in the material because they are only loosely bound to their parent atoms.
</p><p class="paragraph">It would seem that if we joined the N and P materials together by one of the processes mentioned
earlier, all the holes and electrons would pair up. On the contrary, this does not happen. Instead the
electrons in the N material diffuse (move or spread out) across the junction into the P material and fill
some of the holes. At the same time, the holes in the P material diffuse across the junction into the N
material and are filled by N material electrons. This process, called JUNCTION RECOMBINATION,
reduces the number of free electrons and holes in the vicinity of the junction. Because there is a depletion,
or lack of free electrons and holes in this area, it is known as the DEPLETION REGION.
</p><p class="paragraph">The loss of an electron from the N-type material created a positive ion in the N material, while the
loss of a hole from the P material created a negative ion in that material. These ions are fixed in place in
the crystal lattice structure and cannot move. Thus, they make up a layer of fixed charges on the two sides
of the junction as shown in figure 1-17. On the N side of the junction, there is a layer of positively
charged ions; on the P side of the junction, there is a layer of negatively charged ions. An electrostatic

the electrostatic field is increased to the point where the electrons and holes no longer have enough
energy to overcome it, and are repelled by the negative and positive ions respectively. At this point
equilibrium is established and, for all practical purposes, the movement of carriers across the junction
ceases. For this reason, the electrostatic field created by the positive and negative ions in the depletion
region is called a barrier.
</p><p class="paragraph">The action just described occurs almost instantly when the junction is formed. Only the carriers in
the immediate vicinity of the junction are affected. The carriers throughout the remainder of the N and P
material are relatively undisturbed and remain in a balanced condition.
</p><p class="paragraph">FORWARD BIAS.—An external voltage applied to a PN junction is call BIAS. If, for example, a
battery is used to supply bias to a PN junction and is connected so that its voltage opposes the junction
field, it will reduce the junction barrier and, therefore, aid current flow through the junction. This type of
bias is known as forward bias, and it causes the junction to offer only minimum resistance to the flow of
current.
</p><p class="paragraph">Forward bias is illustrated in figure 1-18. Notice the positive terminal of the bias battery is connected
to the P-type material and the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the N-type material. The
positive potential repels holes toward the junction where they neutralize some of the negative ions. At the
same time the negative potential repels electrons toward the junction where they neutralize some of the
positive ions. Since ions on both sides of the barrier are being neutralized, the width of the barrier
decreases. Thus, the effect of the battery voltage in the forward-bias direction is to reduce the barrier
potential across the junction and to allow majority carriers to cross the junction. Current flow in the
forward-biased PN junction is relatively simple. An electron leaves the negative terminal of the battery
and moves to the terminal of the N-type material. It enters the N material, where it is the majority carrier
and moves to the edge of the junction barrier. Because of forward bias, the barrier offers less opposition
to the electron and it will pass through the depletion region into the P-type material. The electron loses
energy in overcoming the opposition of the junction barrier, and upon entering the P material, combines
with a hole. The hole was produced when an electron was extracted from the P material by the positive
potential of the battery. The created hole moves through the P material toward the junction where it
combines with an electron.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">It is important to remember that in the forward biased condition, conduction is by MAJORITY
current carriers (holes in the P-type material and electrons in the N-type material). Increasing the battery
voltage will increase the number of majority carriers arriving at the junction and will therefore increase
the current flow. If the battery voltage is increased to the point where the barrier is greatly reduced, a
heavy current will flow and the junction may be damaged from the resulting heat.
</p><p class="paragraph">REVERSE BIAS.—If the battery mentioned earlier is connected across the junction so that its
voltage aids the junction, it will increase the junction barrier and thereby offer a high resistance to the
current flow through the junction. This type of bias is known as reverse bias.
</p><p class="paragraph">To reverse bias a junction diode, the negative battery terminal is connected to the P-type material,
and the positive battery terminal to the N-type material as shown in figure 1-19. The negative potential
attracts the holes away from the edge of the junction barrier on the P side, while the positive potential
attracts the electrons away from the edge of the barrier on the N side. This action increases the barrier
width because there are more negative ions on the P side of the junction, and more positive ions on the N
side of the junction. Notice in the figure the width of the barrier has increased. This increase in the
number of ions prevents current flow across the junction by majority carriers. However, the current flow
across the barrier is not quite zero because of the minority carriers crossing the junction. As you recall,
when the crystal is subjected to an external source of energy (light, heat, etc.), electron-hole pairs are
generated. The electron-hole pairs produce minority current carriers. There are minority current carriers in
both regions: holes in the N material and electrons in the P material. With reverse bias, the electrons in
the P-type material are repelled toward the junction by the negative terminal of the battery. As the
electron moves across the junction, it will neutralize a positive ion in the N-type material. Similarly, the
holes in the N-type material will be repelled by the positive terminal of the battery toward the junction.
As the hole crosses the junction, it will neutralize a negative ion in the P-type material. This movement of
minority carriers is called MINORITY CURRENT FLOW, because the holes and electrons involved
come from the electron-hole pairs that are generated in the crystal lattice structure, and not from the
addition of impurity atoms.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, when a PN junction is reverse biased, there will be no current flow because of majority
carriers but a very small amount of current because of minority carriers crossing the junction. However, at
normal operating temperatures, this small current may be neglected.
</p><p class="paragraph">In summary, the most important point to remember about the PN junction diode is its ability to offer
very little resistance to current flow in the forward-bias direction but maximum resistance to current flow
when reverse biased. A good way of illustrating this point is by plotting a graph of the applied voltage
versus the measured current. Figure 1-20 shows a plot of this voltage-current relationship (characteristic
curve) for a typical PN junction diode.
</p><p class="paragraph">To determine the resistance from the curve in this figure we can use Ohm’s law:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">For example at point A the forward-bias voltage is 1 volt and the forward-bias current is 5
milliamperes. This represents 200 ohms of resistance (1 volt/5mA = 200 ohms). However, at point B the
voltage is 3 volts and the current is 50 milliamperes. This results in 60 ohms of resistance for the diode.
Notice that when the forward-bias voltage was tripled (1 volt to 3 volts), the current increased 10 times
(5mA to 50 mA). At the same time the forward-bias voltage increased, the resistance decreased from 200
ohms to 60 ohms. In other words, when forward bias increases, the junction barrier gets smaller and its
resistance to current flow decreases.
</p><p class="paragraph">On the other hand, the diode conducts very little when reverse biased. Notice at point C the reverse
bias voltage is 80 volts and the current is only 100 microamperes. This results in 800 k ohms of
resistance, which is considerably larger than the resistance of the junction with forward bias. Because of
these unusual features, the PN junction diode is often used to convert alternating current into direct
current (rectification).

PN JUNCTION APPLICATION
</p><p class="paragraph">Until now, we have mentioned only one application for the diode-rectification, but there are many
more applications that we have not yet discussed. Variations in doping agents, semiconductor materials,
and manufacturing techniques have made it possible to produce diodes that can be used in many different
applications. Examples of these types of diodes are signal diodes, rectifying diodes, Zener diodes (voltage
protection diodes for power supplies), varactors (amplifying and switching diodes), and many more. Only
applications for two of the most commonly used diodes, the signal diode and rectifier diode, will be
presented in this chapter. The other diodes will be explained later on in this module.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Half-Wave Rectifier
</h3><p class="paragraph">One of the most important uses of a diode is rectification. The normal PN junction diode is
well-suited for this purpose as it conducts very heavily when forward biased (low-resistance direction)
and only slightly when reverse biased (high-resistance direction). If we place this diode in series with a
source of ac power, the diode will be forward and reverse biased every cycle. Since in this situation
current flows more easily in one direction than the other, rectification is accomplished. The simplest
rectifier circuit is a half-wave rectifier (fig. 1-21 view A and view B) which consists of a diode, an ac
power source, and a load resister.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The transformer (T1) in the figure provides the ac input to the circuit; the diode (CR1) provides the
rectification; and the load resistor (RL) serves two purposes: it limits the amount of current flow in the
circuit to a safe level, and it also develops the output signal because of the current flow through it.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before describing how this circuit operates, the definition of the word "load" as it applies to power
supplies must be understood. Load is defined as any device that draws current. A device that draws little
current is considered a light load, whereas a device that draws a large amount of current is a heavy load.
Remember that when we speak of "load," we are speaking about the device that draws current from the
power source. This device may be a simple resistor, or one or more complicated electronic circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">During the positive half-cycle of the input signal (solid line) in figure 1-21 view A, the top of the
transformer is positive with respect to ground. The dots on the transformer indicate points of the same
polarity. With this condition the diode is forward biased, the depletion region is narrow, the resistance of
the diode is low, and current flows through the circuit in the direction of the solid lines. When this current
flows through the load resistor, it develops a negative to positive voltage drop across it, which appears as
a positive voltage at the output terminal.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the ac input goes in a negative direction (fig. 1-21 view A), the top of the transformer becomes
negative and the diode becomes reverse biased. With reverse bias applied to the diode, the depletion
region increases, the resistance of the diode is high, and minimum current flows through the diode. For all</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">practical purposes, there is no output developed across the load resistor during the negative alternation of
the input signal as indicated by the broken lines in the figure. Although only one cycle of input is shown,
it should be realized that the action described above continually repeats itself, as long as there is an input.
Therefore, since only the positive half-cycles appear at the output this circuit converted the ac input into a
positive pulsating dc voltage. The frequency of the output voltage is equal to the frequency of the applied
ac signal since there is one pulse out for each cycle of the ac input. For example, if the input frequency is
60 hertz (60 cycles per second), the output frequency is 60 pulses per second (pps).
</p><p class="paragraph">However, if the diode is reversed as shown in view B of figure 1-21, a negative output voltage would
be obtained. This is because the current would be flowing from the top of RL toward the bottom, making
the output at the top of RL  negative with respect to the bottom or ground. Because current flows in this
circuit only during half of the input cycle, it is called a half-wave rectifier.
</p><p class="paragraph">The semiconductor diode shown in the figure can be replaced by a metallic rectifier and still achieve
the same results. The metallic rectifier, sometimes referred to as a dry-disc rectifier, is a metal-to-
semiconductor, large-area contact device. Its construction is distinctive; a semiconductor is sandwiched
between two metal plates, or electrodes, as shown in figure 1-22. Note in the figure that a barrier, with a
resistance many times greater than that of the semiconductor material, is constructed on one of the metal
electrodes. The contact having the barrier is a rectifying contact; the other contact is nonrectifying.
Metallic rectifiers act just like the diodes previously discussed in that they permit current to flow more
readily in one direction than the other. However, the metallic rectifier is fairly large compared to the
crystal diode as can be seen in figure 1-23. The reason for this is: metallic rectifier units are stacked (to
prevent inverse voltage breakdown), have large area plates (to handle high currents), and usually have
cooling fins (to prevent overheating).

</p><p class="paragraph">There are many known metal-semiconductor combinations that can be used for contact rectification.
Copper oxide and selenium devices are by far the most popular. Copper oxide and selenium are
frequently used over other types of metallic rectifiers because they have a large forward current per unit
contact area, low forward voltage drop, good stability, and a lower aging rate. In practical application, the
selenium rectifier is used where a relatively large amount of power is required. On the other hand,
copper-oxide rectifiers are generally used in small-current applications such as ac meter movements or for
delivering direct current to circuits requiring not more than 10 amperes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since metallic rectifiers are affected by temperature, atmospheric conditions, and aging (in the case
of copper oxide and selenium), they are being replaced by the improved silicon crystal rectifier. The
silicon rectifier replaces the bulky selenium rectifier as to current and voltage rating, and can operate at
higher ambient (surrounding) temperatures.
Diode Switch
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to their use as simple rectifiers, diodes are also used in circuits that mix signals together
(mixers), detect the presence of a signal (detector), and act as a switch "to open or close a circuit." Diodes
used in these applications are commonly referred to as "signal diodes." The simplest application of a
signal diode is the basic diode switch shown in figure 1-24.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When the input to this circuit is at zero potential, the diode is forward biased because of the zero
potential on the cathode and the positive voltage on the anode. In this condition, the diode conducts and
acts as a straight piece of wire because of its very low forward resistance. In effect, the input is directly
coupled to the output resulting in zero volts across the output terminals. Therefore, the diode, acts as a
closed switch when its anode is positive with respect to its cathode.
</p><p class="paragraph">If we apply a positive input voltage (equal to or greater than the positive voltage supplied to the
anode) to the diode’s cathode, the diode will be reverse biased. In this situation, the diode is cut off and
acts as an open switch between the input and output terminals. Consequently, with no current flow in the
circuit, the positive voltage on the diode’s anode will be felt at the output terminal. Therefore, the diode
acts as an open switch when it is reverse biased.

DIODE CHARACTERISTICS
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor diodes have properties that enable them to perform many different electronic
functions. To do their jobs, engineers and technicians must be supplied with data on these different types
of diodes. The information presented for this purpose is called DIODE CHARACTERISTICS. These
characteristics are supplied by manufacturers either in their manuals or on specification sheets (data
sheets). Because of the scores of manufacturers and numerous diode types, it is not practical to put before
you a specification sheet and call it typical. Aside from the difference between manufacturers, a single
manufacturer may even supply specification sheets that differ both in format and content. Despite these
differences, certain performance and design information is normally required. We will discuss this
information in the next few paragraphs.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

of the diode which gives dimension, weight, and, if appropriate, any identification marks. In addition to
the above data, the following information is also provided: a static operating table (giving spot values of
parameters under fixed conditions), sometimes a characteristic curve similar to the one in figure 1-20

</h2><p class="paragraph">There are many types of diodes varying in size from the size of a pinhead (used in subminiature
circuitry) to large 250-ampere diodes (used in high-power circuits). Because there are so many different
types of diodes, some system of identification is needed to distinguish one diode from another. This is
accomplished with the semiconductor identification system shown in figure 1-25. This system is not only
used for diodes but transistors and many other special semiconductor devices as well. As illustrated in this
figure, the system uses numbers and letters to identify different types of semiconductor devices. The first
number in the system indicates the number of junctions in the semiconductor device and is a number, one
less than the number of active elements. Thus 1 designates a diode; 2 designates a transistor (which may
be considered as made up of two diodes); and 3 designates a tetrode (a four-element transistor). The letter
"N" following the first number indicates a semiconductor. The 2- or 3-digit number following the letter
"N" is a serialized identification number. If needed, this number may contain a suffix letter after the last
digit. For example, the suffix letter "M" may be used to describe matching pairs of separate
semiconductor devices or the letter "R" may be used to indicate reverse polarity. Other letters are used to
indicate modified versions of the device which can be substituted for the basic numbered unit. For
example, a semiconductor diode designated as type 1N345A signifies a two-element diode (1) of
semiconductor material (N) that is an improved version (A) of type 345.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

expectancies. In theory, a diode should last indefinitely. However, if diodes are subjected to current
overloads, their junctions will be damaged or destroyed. In addition, the application of excessively high
operating voltages can damage or destroy junctions through arc-over, or excessive reverse currents. One

causes diode destruction. Extreme caution should be used when working with equipment containing
diodes to ensure that these problems do not occur and cause irreparable diode damage.
</p><p class="paragraph">The following is a list of some of the special safety precautions that should be observed when
working with diodes:
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never remove or insert a diode into a circuit with voltage applied.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never pry diodes to loosen them from their circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Always be careful when soldering to ensure that excessive heat is not applied to the diode.
</p><p class="paragraph">• When testing a diode, ensure that the test voltage does not exceed the diode’s maximum allowable
voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Never put your fingers across a signal diode because the static charge from your body could short
it out.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Always replace a diode with a direct replacement, or with one of the same type.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Ensure a replacement diode is put into a circuit in the correct direction.
</p><p class="paragraph">If a diode has been subjected to excessive voltage or temperature and is suspected of being defective,
it can be checked in various ways. The most convenient and quickest way of testing a diode is with an
ohmmeter (fig. 1-28). To make the check, simply disconnect one of the diode leads from the circuit
wiring, and make resistance measurements across the leads of the diode. The resistance measurements
obtained depend upon the test-lead polarity of the ohmmeter; therefore, two measurements must be taken.
The first measurement is taken with the test leads connected to either end of the diode and the second
measurement is taken with the test leads reversed on the diode. The larger resistance value is assumed to
be the reverse (back) resistance of the diode, and the smaller resistance (front) value is assumed to be the
forward resistance. Measurement can be made for comparison purposes using another identical-type
diode (known to be good) as a standard. Two high-value resistance measurements indicate that the diode
is open or has a high forward resistance. Two low-value resistance measurements indicate that the diode
is shorted or has a low reverse resistance. A normal set of measurements will show a high resistance in
the reverse direction and a low resistance in the forward direction. The diode’s efficiency is determined by
how low the forward resistance is compared with the reverse resistance. That is, it is desirable to have as
great a ratio (often known as the front-to-back ratio or the back-to-front ratio) as possible between the
reverse and forward resistance measurements. However, as a rule of thumb, a small signal diode will have
a ratio of several hundred to one, while a power rectifier can operate satisfactorily with a ratio of 10 to 1.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">One thing you should keep in mind about the ohmmeter check-it is not conclusive. It is still possible
for a diode to check good under this test, but break down when placed back in the circuit. The problem is
that the meter used to check the diode uses a lower voltage than the diode usually operates at in the
circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another important point to remember is that a diode should not be condemned because two
ohmmeters give different readings on the diode. This occurs because of the different internal resistances
of the ohmmeters and the different states of charge on the ohmmeter batteries. Because each ohmmeter
sends a different current through the diode, the two resistance values read on the meters will not be the
same.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another way of checking a diode is with the substitution method. In this method, a good diode is
substituted for a questionable diode. This technique should be used only after you have made voltage and
resistance measurements to make certain that there is no circuit defect that might damage the substitution
diode. If more than one defective diode is present in the equipment section where trouble has been
localized, this method becomes cumbersome, since several diodes may have to be replaced before the
trouble is corrected. To determine which stages failed and which diodes are not defective, all of the
removed diodes must be tested. This can be accomplished by observing whether the equipment operates
correctly as each of the removed diodes is reinserted into the equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">In conclusion, the only valid check of a diode is a dynamic electrical test that determines the diode’s
forward current (resistance) and reverse current (resistance) parameters. This test can be accomplished
using various crystal diode test sets that are readily available from many manufacturers.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY
</h1><p class="paragraph">Now that we have completed this chapter, a short review of the more important points covered in the
chapter will follow. You should be thoroughly familiar with these points before continuing on to chapter
2.
</p><p class="paragraph">The UNIVERSE consists of two main parts-matter and energy.
</p><p class="paragraph">MATTER is anything that occupies space and has weight. Rocks, water, and air are examples of
matter. Matter may be found in any one of three states: solid, liquid and gaseous. It can also be composed
of either an element or a combination of elements.
</p><p class="paragraph">An ELEMENT is a substance that cannot be reduced to a simpler form by chemical means. Iron,
gold, silver, copper, and oxygen are all good examples of elements.
</p><p class="paragraph">A COMPOUND is a chemical combination of two or more elements. Water, table salt, ethyl
alcohol, and ammonia are all examples of compounds.
</p><p class="paragraph">A MOLECULE is the smallest part of a compound that has all the characteristics of the compound.
Each molecule contains some of the atoms of each of the elements forming the compound.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ATOM is the smallest particle into which an element can be broken down and still retain all its
original properties. An atom is made up of electrons, protons, and neutrons. The number and arrangement
of these particles determine the kind of element.
</p><p class="paragraph">An ELECTRON carries a small negative charge of electricity.
</p><p class="paragraph">The PROTON carries a positive charge of electricity that is equal and opposite to the charge of the
electron. However, the mass of the proton is approximately 1,837 times that of the electron.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The NEUTRON is a neutral particle in that it has no electrical charge. The mass of the neutron is
approximately equal to that of the proton.
</p><p class="paragraph">An ELECTRON’S ENERGY LEVEL is the amount of energy required by an electron to stay in
orbit. Just by the electron’s motion alone, it has kinetic energy. The electron’s position in reference to the
nucleus gives it potential energy. An energy balance keeps the electron in orbit and as it gains or loses
energy, it assumes an orbit further from or closer to the center of the atom.
</p><p class="paragraph">SHELLS and SUBSHELLS are the orbits of the electrons in an atom. Each shell can contain a
maximum number of electrons, which can be determined by the formula 2n 2. Shells are lettered K
through Q, starting with K, which is the closest to the nucleus. The shell can also be split into four
subshells labeled s, p, d, and f, which can contain 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons, respectively.
</p><p class="paragraph">VALENCE is the ability of an atom to combine with other atoms. The valence of an atom is
determined by the number of electrons in the atom’s outermost shell. This shell is referred to as the
VALENCE SHELL. The electrons in the outermost shell are called VALENCE ELECTRONS.
</p><p class="paragraph">IONIZATION is the process by which an atom loses or gains electrons. An atom that loses some of
its electrons in the process becomes positively charged and is called a POSITIVE ION. An atom that has
an excess number of electrons is negatively charged and is called a NEGATIVE ION.
</p><p class="paragraph">ENERGY BANDS are groups of energy levels that result from the close proximity of atoms in a
solid. The three most important energy bands are the CONDUCTION BAND, FORBIDDEN BAND, and
VALENCE BAND.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">CONDUCTORS, SEMICONDUCTORS, and INSULATORS are categorized as such by using
the energy band concept. It is the width of the forbidden band that determines whether a material is an
insulator, a semiconductor, or a conductor. A CONDUCTOR has a very narrow forbidden band or none at
all. A SEMICONDUCTOR has a medium width forbidden band. An INSULATOR has a wide forbidden
band.
</p><p class="paragraph">COVALENT BONDING is the sharing of valence electrons between two or more atoms. It is this
bonding that holds the atoms together in an orderly structure called a CRYSTAL.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The CONDUCTION PROCESS in a SEMICONDUCTOR is accomplished by two different types
of current flow: HOLE FLOW and ELECTRON FLOW. Hole flow is very similar to electron flow
except that holes (positive charges) move toward a negative potential and in an opposite direction to that
of the electrons. In an INTRINSIC semiconductor (one which does not contain any impurities), the
number of holes always equals the number of conducting electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">DOPING is the process by which small amounts of selected additives, called impurities, are added
to semiconductors to increase their current flow. Semiconductors that undergo this treatment are referred
to as EXTRINSIC SEMICONDUCTORS.
</p><h3 class="subsection">An N-TYPE SEMICONDUCTOR is one that is doped with an N-TYPE or donor impurity (an
impurity that easily loses its extra electron to the semiconductor causing it to have an excess number of</h3><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the majority current carriers, while the holes are the minority current carriers.
</p><p class="paragraph">A P-TYPE SEMICONDUCTOR is one which is doped with a P-TYPE or acceptor impurity (an
impurity that reduces the number of free electrons causing more holes). The holes in this type
semiconductor are the majority current carriers since they are present in the greatest quantity while the
electrons are the minority current carriers.
</p><p class="paragraph">The SEMICONDUCTOR DIODE, also known as a PN JUNCTION DIODE, is a two-element
semiconductor device that makes use of the rectifying properties of a PN junction to convert alternating
current into direct current by permitting current flow in only one direction.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

commonly used manufacturing techniques are: GROWN, ALLOY or FUSED-ALLOY, DIFFUSED,
and POINT-CONTACT.
</p><p class="paragraph">CURRENT FLOW in an N-TYPE MATERIAL is similar to conduction in a copper wire. That is,
with voltage applied across the material, electrons will move through the crystal toward the positive
terminal just like current flows in a copper wire.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">CURRENT FLOW in a P-TYPE MATERIAL is by positive holes, instead of negative electrons.
Unlike the electron, the hole moves from the positive terminal of the P material to the negative terminal.
</p><p class="paragraph">JUNCTION BARRIER is an electrostatic field that has been created by the joining of a section of
N material with a section of P material. Since holes and electrons must overcome this field to cross the
junction, the electrostatic field is commonly called a BARRIER. Because there is a lack or depletion of
free electrons and holes in the area around the barrier, this area has become known as the DEPLETION
REGION.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">FORWARD BIAS is an external voltage that is applied to a PN junction to reduce its barrier and,
therefore, aid current flow through the junction. To accomplish this function, the external voltage is
connected so that it opposes the electrostatic field of the junction.
</p><p class="paragraph">REVERSE BIAS is an external voltage that is connected across a PN junction so that its voltage
aids the junction and, thereby, offers a high resistance to the current flow through the junction.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The PN JUNCTION has a unique ability to offer very little resistance to current flow in the
forward-bias direction, but maximum resistance to current flow when reverse biased. For this reason, the
PN junction is commonly used as a diode to convert ac to dc.
</p><p class="paragraph">The PN JUNCTION’S APPLICATION expands many different areas-from a simple voltage
protection device to an amplifying diode. Two of the most commonly used applications for the PN
junction are the SIGNAL DIODE (mixing, detecting, and switching signals) and the RECTIFYING
DIODE (converting ac to dc).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The first solid-state device discussed was the two-element semiconductor diode. The next device on our 
</p><p class="paragraph">list is even more unique. It not only has one more element than the diode but it can amplify as well. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Semiconductor devices that have-three or more elements are called TRANSISTORS. The term transistor 
</p><p class="paragraph">was derived from the words TRANSfer and resISTOR. This term was adopted because it best describes the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">operation of the transistor - the transfer of an input signal current from a low-resistance circuit to a high-
</h3><p class="paragraph">resistance circuit. Basically, the transistor is a solid-state device that amplifies by controlling the flow of 
</p><p class="paragraph">current carriers through its semiconductor materials. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are many different types of transistors, but their basic theory of operation is all the same. As a 
</p><h3 class="subsection">matter of fact, the theory we will be using to explain the operation of a transistor is the same theory used 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">earlier with the PN-junction diode except that now two such junctions are required to form the three 
</h3><p class="paragraph">elements of a transistor. The three elements of the two-junction transistor are (1) the EMITTER, which gives 
</p><h3 class="subsection">off, or emits," current carriers (electrons or holes); (2) the BASE, which controls the flow of current carriers; 
</h3><p class="paragraph">and (3) the COLLECTOR, which collects the current carriers.

</p><p class="paragraph">junction is comparable to a high-resistance circuit element. By using the Ohm's law formula for power

</h3><p class="paragraph">forward-biased junction and produce a high-power signal at the reverse-biased junction. In this manner, a 
</p><p class="paragraph">power gain would be obtained across the crystal. This concept, which is merely an extension of the material 
</p><p class="paragraph">covered in chapter 1, is the basic theory behind how the transistor amplifies. With this information fresh in 
</p><p class="paragraph">your mind, let's proceed directly to the NPN transistor. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">NPN Transistor Operation 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">Just as in the case of the PN junction diode, the N material comprising the two end sections of the NP N 
</h3><p class="paragraph">transistor contains a number of free electrons, while the center P section contains an excess number of holes. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The action at each junction between these sections is the same as that previously described for the diode;

</p><p class="paragraph">of these junctions must be modified by some external bias voltage. For the transistor to function in this

</p><p class="paragraph">for correct bias. For instance, notice the NPN transistor below:

</p><p class="paragraph">1. The emitter, which is the first letter in the NPN sequence, is connected to the negative side of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">battery while the base, which is the second letter (NPN), is connected to the positive side. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. However, since the second PN junction is required to be reverse biased for proper transistor 
</p><h3 class="subsection">operation, the collector must be connected to an opposite polarity voltage (positive) than that

</p><h3 class="subsection">The bias batteries in this figure have been labeled V CC for the collector voltage supply, and VBB for the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">base voltage supply. Also notice the base supply battery is quite small, as indicated by the number of cells in 
</p><p class="paragraph">the battery, usually 1 volt or less. However, the collector supply is generally much higher than the base 
</p><p class="paragraph">supply, normally around 6 volts. As you will see later, this difference in supply voltages is necessary to have 
</p><p class="paragraph">current flow from the emitter to the collector. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">As stated earlier, the current flow in the external circuit is always due to the movement of free 
</h3><p class="paragraph">electrons. Therefore, electrons flow from the negative terminals of the supply batteries to the N-type emitter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This combined movement of electrons is known as emitter current (IE). Since electrons are the majority 
</p><p class="paragraph">carriers in the N material, they will move through the N material emitter to the emitter-base junction. With 
</p><p class="paragraph">this junction forward biased, electrons continue on into the base region. Once the electrons are in the base, 
</p><p class="paragraph">which is a P-type material, they become minority carriers. Some of the electrons that move into the base

</p><p class="paragraph">In summary, total current flow in the NPN transistor is through the emitter lead. Therefore, in terms of

</p><p class="paragraph">percentage of the total current (emitter current) will flow in the base circuit than in the collector circuit. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Usually no more than 2 to 5 percent of the total current is base current (IB) while the remaining 95 to 98 
</h3><p class="paragraph">percent is collector current (IC). A very basic relationship exists between these two currents: 
</p><h3 class="subsection">IE = IB + I C 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In simple terms this means that the emitter current is separated into base and collector current. Since the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">amount of current leaving the emitter is solely a function of the emitter-base bias, and because the collector 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">receives most of this current, a small change in emitter-base bias will have a far greater effect on the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">magnitude of collector current than it will have on base current. In conclusion, the relatively small emitter-
</p><p class="paragraph">base bias controls the relatively large emitter-to-collector current.

</p><p class="question">Q8. In the NPN transistor, what section is made very thin compared with the other two sections? 
</p><p class="question">Q9. What percentage of current in an NPN transistor reaches the collector? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">PNP Transistor Operation 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The PNP transistor works essentially the same as the NPN transistor. However, since the emitter, base, 
</p><h3 class="subsection">and collector in the PNP transistor are made of materials that are different from those used in the NPN 
</h3><p class="paragraph">transistor, different current carriers flow in the PNP unit. The majority current carriers in the PNP transistor 
</p><p class="paragraph">are holes. This is in contrast to the NPN transistor where the majority current carriers are electrons. To 
</p><p class="paragraph">support this different type of current (hole flow), the bias batteries are reversed for the PNP transistor. A 
</p><p class="paragraph">typical bias setup for the PNP transistor is shown in figure 2-8. Notice that the procedure used earlier to 
</p><p class="paragraph">properly bias the NPN transistor also applies here to the PNP transistor. The first letter (P) in the PNP 
</p><h3 class="subsection">sequence indicates the polarity of the voltage required for the emitter (positive), and the second letter (N) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">indicates the polarity of the base voltage (negative). Since the base-collector junction is always reverse 
</p><p class="paragraph">biased, then the opposite polarity voltage (negative) must be used for the collector. Thus, the base of the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">PNP transistor must be negative with respect to the emitter, and the collector must be more negative than the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">base. Remember, just as in the case of the NPN transistor, this difference in supply voltage is necessary to 
</p><p class="paragraph">have current flow (hole flow in the case of the PNP transistor) from the emitter to the collector. Although 
</p><h3 class="subsection">hole flow is the predominant type of current flow in the PNP transistor, hole flow only takes place within the

</p><h3 class="subsection">mentioned earlier and with the internal operation of the transistor, we will move on to the basic transistor 
</h3><p class="paragraph">amplifier. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">To understand the overall operation of the transistor amplifier, you must only consider the current in 
</h3><p class="paragraph">and out of the transistor and through the various components in the circuit. Therefore, from this point on, 
</p><h3 class="subsection">only the schematic symbol for the transistor will be used in the illustrations, and rather than thinking about 
</h3><p class="paragraph">majority and minority carriers, we will now start thinking in terms of emitter, base, and collector current. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before going into the basic transistor amplifier, there are two terms you should be familiar with: 
</p><p class="paragraph">AMPLIFICATION and AMPLIFIER. Amplification is the process of increasing the strength of a SIGNAL. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A signal is just a general term used to refer to any particular current, voltage, or power in a circuit. An 
</p><h3 class="subsection">amplifier is the device that provides amplification (the increase in current, voltage, or power of a signal) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">without appreciably altering the original signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Transistors are frequently used as amplifiers. Some transistor circuits are CURRENT amplifiers, with a 
</p><h3 class="subsection">small load resistance; other circuits are designed for VOLTAGE amplification and have a high load 
</h3><p class="paragraph">resistance; others amplify POWER. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Now take a look at the NPN version of the basic transistor amplifier in figure 2-12 and let's see just how 
</h3><p class="paragraph">it works. 
</p><p class="paragraph">So far in this discussion, a separate battery has been used to provide the necessary forward-bias voltage. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Although a separate battery has been used in the past for convenience, it is not practical to use a battery for 
</h3><p class="paragraph">emitter-base bias. For instance, it would take a battery slightly over .2 volts to properly forward bias a 
</p><p class="paragraph">germanium transistor, while a similar silicon transistor would require a voltage slightly over .6 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">However, common batteries do not have such voltage values. Also, since bias voltages are quite critical and 
</p><h3 class="subsection">must be held within a few tenths of one volt, it is easier to work with bias currents flowing through resistors 
</h3><p class="paragraph">of high ohmic values than with batteries. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">By inserting one or more resistors in a circuit, different methods of biasing may be achieved and the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">emitter-base battery eliminated. In addition to eliminating the battery, some of these biasing methods 
</p><h3 class="subsection">compensate for slight variations in transistor characteristics and changes in transistor conduction resulting 
</h3><p class="paragraph">from temperature irregularities. Notice in figure 2-12 that the emitter-base battery has been eliminated and 
</p><p class="paragraph">the bias resistor R B has been inserted between the collector and the base. Resistor RB provides the necessary 
</p><p class="paragraph">forward bias for the emitter-base junction. Current flows in the emitter-base bias circuit from ground to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">emitter, out the base lead, and through R B to V CC. Since the current in the base circuit is very small (a few 
</p><h3 class="subsection">hundred microamperes) and the forward resistance of the transistor is low, only a few tenths of a volt of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">positive bias will be felt on the base of the transistor. However, this is enough voltage on the base, along 
</p><p class="paragraph">with ground on the emitter and the large positive voltage on the collector, to properly bias the transistor. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">With Q1 properly biased, direct current flows continuously, with or without an input signal, throughout

</p><p class="paragraph">develops the collector voltage (VC) as it flows through Q1 and R L. Notice the collector voltage on the output 
</p><p class="paragraph">graph. Since it is present in the circuit without an input signal, the output signal starts at the VC level and 
</p><p class="paragraph">either increases or decreases. These dc voltages and currents that exist in the circuit before the application of 
</p><p class="paragraph">a signal are known as QUIESCENT voltages and currents (the quiescent state of the circuit). 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Resistor RL, the collector load resistor, is placed in the circuit to keep the full effect of the collector

</p><p class="paragraph">During the negative alternation of the input, the input signal opposes the forward bias. This action 
</p><p class="paragraph">decreases base current, which results in a decrease in both emitter and collector currents. The decrease in 
</p><h3 class="subsection">current through R L decreases its voltage drop and causes the voltage across the transistor to rise along with

</p><p class="paragraph">voltage that is larger than the input but has the same sine wave characteristics. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">By examining both input and output signals for one complete alternation of the input, we can see that

</p><p class="paragraph">The PNP version of this amplifier is shown in the upper part of the figure. The primary difference 
</p><p class="paragraph">between the NPN and PNP amplifier is the polarity of the source voltage. With a negative VCC, the PNP base 
</p><h3 class="subsection">voltage is slightly negative with respect to ground, which provides the necessary forward bias condition

</p><p class="paragraph">When the PNP input signal goes positive, it opposes the forward bias of the transistor. This action 
</p><h3 class="subsection">cancels some of the negative voltage across the emitter-base junction, which reduces the current through the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">transistor. Therefore, the voltage across the load resistor decreases, and the voltage across the transistor 
</p><p class="paragraph">increases. Since VCC is negative, the voltage on the collector (VC) goes in a negative direction (as shown on

</p><h3 class="subsection">Thus a need arises for a method to properly bias the transistor amplifier and at the same time stabilize its dc 
</h3><p class="paragraph">operating point (the no signal values of collector voltage and collector current). As mentioned earlier, 
</p><p class="paragraph">various biasing methods can be used to accomplish both of these functions. Although there are numerous 
</p><p class="paragraph">biasing methods, only three basic types will be considered. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Base-Current Bias (Fixed Bias) 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">The first biasing method, called BASE CURRENT BIAS or sometimes FIXED BIAS, was used in 
</h3><p class="paragraph">figure 2-12. As you recall, it consisted basically of a resistor (RB) connected between the collector supply 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltage and the base. Unfortunately, this simple arrangement is quite thermally unstable. If the temperature 
</p><h3 class="subsection">of the transistor rises for any reason (due to a rise in ambient temperature or due to current flow through it), 
</h3><p class="paragraph">collector current will increase. This increase in current also causes the dc operating point, sometimes called 
</p><p class="paragraph">the quiescent or static point, to move away from its desired position (level). This reaction to temperature is 
</p><h3 class="subsection">undesirable because it affects amplifier gain (the number of times of amplification) and could result in 
</h3><p class="paragraph">distortion, as you will see later in this discussion. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Self-Bias 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">A better method of biasing is obtained by inserting the bias resistor directly between the base and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">collector, as shown in figure 2-13. By tying the collector to the base in this manner, feedback voltage can be 
</p><p class="paragraph">fed from the collector to the base to develop forward bias. This arrangement is called SELF-BIAS. Now, if 
</p><h3 class="subsection">an increase of temperature causes an increase in collector current, the collector voltage (VC) will fall because 
</h3><p class="paragraph">of the increase of voltage produced across the load resistor (RL). This drop in VC will be fed back to the base 
</p><p class="paragraph">and will result in a decrease in the base current. The decrease in base current will oppose the original 
</p><p class="paragraph">increase in collector current and tend to stabilize it. The exact opposite effect is produced when the collector 
</p><p class="paragraph">current decreases. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Self-bias has two small drawbacks: (1) It is only partially effective and, therefore, is only used where 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">moderate changes in ambient temperature are expected; (2) it reduces amplification since the signal on the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">collector also affects the base voltage. This is because the collector and base signals for this particular 
</p><h3 class="subsection">amplifier configuration are 180 degrees out of phase (opposite in polarity) and the part of the collector signal 
</h3><p class="paragraph">that is fed back to the base cancels some of the input signal. This process of returning a part of the output 
</p><p class="paragraph">back to its input is known as DEGENERATION or NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. Sometimes degeneration is </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><h3 class="subsection">A combination of fixed and self-bias can be used to improve stability and at the same time overcome 
</h3><p class="paragraph">some of the disadvantages of the other two biasing methods. One of the most widely used combination-bias 
</p><p class="paragraph">systems is the voltage-divider type shown in figure 2-14. Fixed bias is provided in this circuit by the voltage-
</p><p class="paragraph">divider network consisting of R1, R2, and the collector supply voltage (VCC). The dc current flowing through 
</p><p class="paragraph">the voltage-divider network biases the base positive with respect to the emitter. Resistor R3, which is 
</p><p class="paragraph">connected in series with the emitter, provides the emitter with self-bias. Should IE increase, the voltage drop 
</p><p class="paragraph">across R3 would also increase, reducing VC. This reaction to an increase in IE by R3 is another form of 
</p><p class="paragraph">degeneration, which results in less output from the amplifier. However, to provide long-term or dc thermal 
</p><h3 class="subsection">stability, and at the same time, allow minimal ac signal degeneration, the bypass capacitor (Cbp) is placed 
</h3><p class="paragraph">across R3. If Cbp is large enough, rapid signal variations will not change its charge materially and no 
</p><p class="paragraph">degeneration of the signal will occur. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">In summary, the fixed-bias resistors, R1 and R2, tend to keep the base bias constant while the emitter

</p><p class="paragraph">degrees of the input signal, as shown in figure 2-15 view B. As compared to the class A amplifier, the dc

</p><h3 class="subsection">The class AB operated amplifier is commonly used as a push-pull amplifier to overcome a side effect

</p><h3 class="subsection">Class B Amplifier Operation 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">Amplifiers biased so that collector current is cut off during one-half of the input signal are classified 
</h3><p class="paragraph">class B. The dc operating point for this class of amplifier is set up so that base current is zero with no 
</p><p class="paragraph">input signal. When a signal is applied, one half cycle will forward bias the base-emitter junction and IC 
</p><p class="paragraph">will flow. The other half cycle will reverse bias the base-emitter junction and IC will be cut off. Thus, for 
</p><h3 class="subsection">class B operation, collector current will flow for approximately 180 degrees (half) of the input signal, as 
</h3><p class="paragraph">shown in figure 2-15 view C. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The class B operated amplifier is used extensively for audio amplifiers that require high-power 
</h3><p class="paragraph">outputs. It is also used as the driver- and power-amplifier stages of transmitters. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Class C Amplifier Operation 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">In class C operation, collector current flows for less than one half cycle of the input signal, as shown 
</h3><p class="paragraph">in figure 2-15 view D. The class C operation is achieved by reverse biasing the emitter-base junction, 
</p><h3 class="subsection">which sets the dc operating point below cutoff and allows only the portion of the input signal that 
</h3><p class="paragraph">overcomes the reverse bias to cause collector current flow. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The class C operated amplifier is used as a radio-frequency amplifier in transmitters. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">From the previous discussion, you can conclude that two primary items determine the class of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">operation of an amplifier  (1) the amount of bias and (2) the amplitude of the input signal. With a given 
</p><h3 class="subsection">input signal and bias level, you can change the operation of an amplifier from class A to class B just by 
</h3><p class="paragraph">removing forward bias. Also, a class A amplifier can be changed to class AB by increasing the input 
</p><p class="paragraph">signal amplitude. However, if an input signal amplitude is increased to the point that the transistor goes 
</p><p class="paragraph">into saturation and cutoff, it is then called an OVERDRIVEN amplifier. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">You should be familiar with two terms used in conjunction with amplifiers  FIDELITY and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">EFFICIENCY. Fidelity is the faithful reproduction of a signal. In other words, if the output of an 
</p><p class="paragraph">amplifier is just like the input except in amplitude, the amplifier has a high degree of fidelity. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">opposite of fidelity is a term we mentioned earlier  distortion. Therefore, a circuit that has high fidelity 
</p><p class="paragraph">has low distortion. In conclusion, a class A amplifier has a high degree of fidelity. A class AB amplifier 
</p><p class="paragraph">has less fidelity, and class B and class C amplifiers have low or "poor" fidelity. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The efficiency of an amplifier refers to the ratio of output-signal power compared to the total input 
</h3><p class="paragraph">power. An amplifier has two input power sources: one from the signal, and one from the power supply. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Since every device takes power to operate, an amplifier that operates for 360 degrees of the input signal 
</h3><p class="paragraph">uses more power than if operated for 180 degrees of the input signal. By using more power, an amplifier 
</p><p class="paragraph">has less power available for the output signal; thus the efficiency of the amplifier is low. This is the case </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">figure 2-16 view A. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">When a transistor is connected in a common-emitter configuration, the input signal is injected 
</h3><p class="paragraph">between the base and emitter, which is a low resistance, low-current circuit. As the input signal swings 
</p><p class="paragraph">positive, it also causes the base to swing positive with respect to the emitter. This action decreases 
</p><h3 class="subsection">forward bias which reduces collector current (IC) and increases collector voltage (making VC more

</p><p class="paragraph">respect to the emitter. This increases forward bias and allows more current carriers to be released from the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">emitter, which results in an increase in collector current and a decrease in collector voltage (making VC 
</h3><p class="paragraph">less negative or swing in a positive direction). The collector current that flows through the high resistance 
</p><h3 class="subsection">reverse-biased junction also flows through a high resistance load (not shown), resulting in a high level of 
</h3><p class="paragraph">amplification. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Since the input signal to the common emitter goes positive when the output goes negative, the two 
</h3><p class="paragraph">signals (input and output) are 180 degrees out of phase. The common-emitter circuit is the only 
</p><p class="paragraph">configuration that provides a phase reversal. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The common-emitter is the most popular of the three transistor configurations because it has the best 
</h3><p class="paragraph">combination of current and voltage gain. The term GAIN is used to describe the amplification capabilities 
of the amplifier. It is basically a ratio of output versus input. Each transistor configuration gives a 
</p><p class="paragraph">different value of gain even though the same transistor is used. The transistor configuration used is a 
</p><p class="paragraph">matter of design consideration. However, as a technician you will become interested in this output versus 
</p><p class="paragraph">input ratio (gain) to determine whether or not the transistor is working properly in the circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The current gain in the common-emitter circuit is called BETA (β). Beta is the relationship of

Common Base 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The common-base configuration (CB) shown in figure 2-16, view B is mainly used for impedance

</p><h3 class="subsection">In the common-base configuration, the input signal is applied to the emitter, the output is taken from 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the collector, and the base is the element common to both input and output. Since the input is applied to

</p><p class="paragraph">2. Always connect a ground between test equipment and circuit before attempting to inject or

</p><p class="paragraph">3. Ensure test voltages do not exceed maximum allowable voltage for circuit components and 
</p><p class="paragraph">transistors. Also, never connect test equipment outputs directly to a transistor circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Ohmmeter ranges that require a current of more than one milliampere in the test circuit should not 
</p><p class="paragraph">be used for testing transistors. 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. Battery eliminators should not be used to furnish power for transistor equipment because they 
</p><p class="paragraph">have poor voltage regulation and, possibly, high-ripple voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">6. The heat applied to a transistor, when soldered connections are required, should be kept to a 
</p><h3 class="subsection">minimum by using a low-wattage soldering iron and heat shunts, such as long-nose pliers, on the

</p><p class="paragraph">7. When it becomes necessary to replace transistors, never pry transistors to loosen them from

</p><p class="paragraph">9. The power must be removed from the equipment before replacing a transistor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">10. Using conventional test probes on equipment with closely spaced parts often causes accidental 
</p><p class="paragraph">shorts between adjacent terminals. These shorts rarely cause damage to an electron tube but may

</p><p class="paragraph">between emitter and collector until the emitter-base junction is forward biased. The only precaution you

</p><p class="paragraph">of trouble, the entire circuit is replaced as a single component. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Basically, there are two general classifications of integrated circuits: HYBRID and MONOLITHIC. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the monolithic integrated circuit, all elements (resistors, transistors, etc.) associated with the circuit are 
</p><p class="paragraph">fabricated inseparably within a continuous piece of material (called the SUBSTRATE), usually silicon. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The monolithic integrated circuit is made very much like a single transistor. While one part of the crystal 
</p><h3 class="subsection">is being doped to form a transistor, other parts of the crystal are being acted upon to form the associated 
</h3><p class="paragraph">resistors and capacitors. Thus, all the elements of the complete circuit are created in the crystal by the 
</p><p class="paragraph">same processes and in the same time required to make a single transistor. This produces a considerable 
</p><p class="paragraph">cost savings over the same circuit made with discrete components by lowering assembly costs. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Hybrid integrated circuits are constructed somewhat differently from the monolithic devices. The 
</p><h3 class="subsection">PASSIVE components (resistors, capacitors) are deposited onto a substrate (foundation) made of glass, 
</h3><p class="paragraph">ceramic, or other insulating material. Then the ACTIVE components (diodes, transistors) are attached to 
</p><p class="paragraph">the substrate and connected to the passive circuit components on the substrate using very fine (.001 inch) 
</p><p class="paragraph">wire. The term hybrid refers to the fact that different processes are used to form the passive and active 
</p><p class="paragraph">components of the device. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Hybrid circuits are of two general types: (1) thin film and (2) thick film. "Thin" and "thick" film 
</p><h3 class="subsection">refer to the relative thickness of the deposited material used to form the resistors and other passive 
</h3><p class="paragraph">components. Thick film devices are capable of dissipating more power, but are somewhat more bulky. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Integrated circuits are being used in an ever increasing variety of applications. Small size and weight 
</p><h3 class="subsection">and high reliability make them ideally suited for use in airborne equipment, missile systems, computers, 
</h3><p class="paragraph">spacecraft, and portable equipment. They are often easily recognized because of the unusual packages that 
</p><p class="paragraph">contain the integrated circuit. A typical packaging sequence is shown in figure 2-22. These tiny packages 
</p><p class="paragraph">protect and help dissipate heat generated in the device. One of these packages may contain one or several 
</p><p class="paragraph">stages, often having several hundred components. Some of the most common package styles are shown in 
</p><p class="paragraph">figure 2-23.

</p><p class="paragraph">There are four classes of amplifier operations: class A, class AB, class B, and class C. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">CUTOFF occurs when the base-to-emitter bias prevents current from flowing in the emitter circuit. 
For example, in the PNP transistor, if the base becomes positive with respect to the emitter, holes are 
</p><p class="paragraph">repelled at the emitter-base junction. This prevents current from flowing in the collector circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">SATURATION occurs in a PNP transistor when the base becomes so negative, with respect to the 
emitter, that changes in the signal are not reflected in collector-current flow. 
</p><p class="paragraph">CLASS A AMPLIFIERS are biased so that variations in input signal polarities occur within the 
limits of cutoff and saturation. Biasing an amplifier in this manner allows collector current to flow during 
</p><h3 class="subsection">the complete cycle (360 degrees) of the input signal, thus providing an output which is a replica of the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">input but 180 degrees out of phase. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Class A operated amplifiers are used as audio- and radio-frequency amplifiers in radio, radar, and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">sound systems. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">CLASS AB AMPLIFIERS are biased so that collector current is zero (cutoff) for a portion of one 
alternation of the input signal. Therefore, collector current will flow for more than 180 degrees but less 
</p><p class="paragraph">than 360 degrees of the input signal. The class AB amplifier is commonly used as a push-pull amplifier to 
</p><p class="paragraph">overcome a side effect of class B operations. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

faithful reproduction of a signal, while efficiency is the ratio of output signal power compared to the total

</h2><p class="paragraph">Diodes are two terminal semiconductors of various types that are used in seemingly endless 
applications. The operation of normal PN-junction diodes has already been discussed, but there are a 
number of diodes with special properties with which you should be familiar. A discussion of all of the 
developments in the diode field would be impossible so some of the more commonly used special diodes 
have been selected for explanation. These include Zener diodes, tunnel diodes, varactors, silicon 
controlled rectifiers (SCR), and TRIACs. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Zener Diodes 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When a PN-junction diode is reverse biased, the majority carriers (holes in the P-material and 
electrons in the N-material) move away from the junction. The barrier or depletion region becomes wider, 
as illustrated in figure 3-1, (view A, view B, view C) and majority carrier current flow becomes very 
difficult across the high resistance of the wide depletion region. The presence of minority carriers causes 
a small leakage current that remains nearly constant for all reverse voltages up to a certain value. Once 
this value has been exceeded, there is a sudden increase in the reverse current. The voltage at which the 
sudden increase in current occurs is called the BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE. At breakdown, the reverse 
current increases very rapidly with a slight increase in the reverse voltage. Any diode can be reverse 
biased to the point of breakdown, but not every diode can safely dissipate the power associated with 
breakdown. A Zener diode is a PN junction designed to operate in the reverse-bias breakdown region.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two distinct theories used to explain the behavior of PN junctions during breakdown: one 
is the ZENER EFFECT and the other is the AVALANCHE EFFECT. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ZENER EFFECT was first proposed by Dr. Carl Zener in 1934. According to Dr. Zener's 
theory, electrical breakdown in solid dielectrics occurs by a process called QUANTUM-MECHANICAL 
TUNNELING. The Zener effect accounts for the breakdown below 5 volts; whereas, above 5 volts the 
breakdown is caused by the avalanche effect. Although the avalanche effect is now accepted as an 
explanation of diode breakdown, the term Zener diode is used to cover both types. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The true Zener effect in semiconductors can be described in terms of energy bands; however, only 
the two upper energy bands are of interest. The two upper bands, illustrated in figure 3-2, view A, are 
called the conduction band and the valence band. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-2A.-Energy diagram for Zener diode. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The CONDUCTION BAND is a band in which the energy level of the electrons is high enough that 
the electrons will move easily under the influence of an external field. Since current flow is the movement 
of electrons, the readily mobile electrons in the conduction band are capable of maintaining a current flow 
when an external field in the form of a voltage is applied. Therefore, solid materials that have many 
electrons in the conduction band are called conductors. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The VALENCE BAND is a band in which the energy level is the same as the valence electrons of 
the atoms. Since the electrons in these levels are attached to the atoms, the electrons are not free to move 
around as are the conduction band electrons. With the proper amount of energy added, however, the 
electrons in the valence band may be elevated to the conduction band energy level. To do this, the 
electrons must cross a gap that exists between the valence band energy level and the conduction band 
energy level. This gap is known as the FORBIDDEN ENERGY BAND or FORBIDDEN GAP. The </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">energy difference across this gap determines whether a solid material will act as a conductor, a 
semiconductor, or an insulator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A conductor is a material in which the forbidden gap is so narrow that it can be considered 
nonexistent. A semiconductor is a solid that contains a forbidden gap, as shown in figure 3-2, view A. 
Normally, a semiconductor has no electrons at the conduction band energy level. The energy provided by 
room temperature heat, however, is enough energy to overcome the binding force of a few valence 
electrons and to elevate them to the conduction band energy level. The addition of impurities to the 
semiconductor material increases both the number of free electrons in the conduction band and the 
number of electrons in the valence band that can be elevated to the conduction band. Insulators are 
materials in which the forbidden gap is so large that practically no electrons can be given enough energy 
to cross the gap. Therefore, unless extremely large amounts of heat energy are available, these materials 
will not conduct electricity. 
</p><p class="paragraph">View B of figure 3-2 is an energy diagram of a reverse-biased Zener diode. The energy bands of the 
P and N materials are naturally at different levels, but reverse bias causes the valence band of the P 
material to overlap the energy level of the conduction band in the N material. Under this condition, the 
valence electrons of the P material can cross the extremely thin junction region at the overlap point 
without acquiring any additional energy. This action is called tunneling. When the breakdown point of the 
PN junction is reached, large numbers of minority carriers "tunnel" across the junction to form the current 
that occurs at breakdown. The tunneling phenomenon only takes place in heavily doped diodes such as 
Zener diodes. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-2B.-Energy diagram for Zener diode. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The second theory of reverse breakdown effect in diodes is known as AVALANCHE breakdown and 
occurs at reverse voltages beyond 5 volts. This type of breakdown diode has a depletion region that is 
deliberately made narrower than the depletion region in the normal PN-junction diode, but thicker than 
that in the Zener-effect diode. The thicker depletion region is achieved by decreasing the doping level 
from the level used in Zener-effect diodes. The breakdown is at a higher voltage because of the higher </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">resistivity of the material. Controlling the doping level of the material during the manufacturing process 
can produce breakdown voltages ranging between about 2 and 200 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The mechanism of avalanche breakdown is different from that of the Zener effect. In the depletion 
region of a PN junction, thermal energy is responsible for the formation of electron-hole pairs. The 
leakage current is caused by the movement of minority electrons, which is accelerated in the electric field 
across the barrier region. As the reverse voltage across the depletion region is increased, the reverse 
voltage eventually reaches a critical value. Once the critical or breakdown voltage has been reached, 
sufficient energy is gained by the thermally released minority electrons to enable the electrons to rupture 
covalent bonds as they collide with lattice atoms. The released electrons are also accelerated by the 
electric field, resulting in the release of further electrons, and so on, in a chain or avalanche effect. This 
process is illustrated in figure 3-3. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">For reverse voltage slightly higher than breakdown, the avalanche effect releases an almost unlimited 
number of carriers so that the diode essentially becomes a short circuit. The current flow in this region is 
limited only by an external series current-limiting resistor. Operating a diode in the breakdown region 
does not damage it, as long as the maximum power dissipation rating of the diode is not exceeded. 
Removing the reverse voltage permits all carriers to return to their normal energy values and velocities. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Some of the symbols used to represent Zener diodes are illustrated in figure 3-4 (view A, view B, 
view C, view D, and view E). Note that the polarity markings indicate electron flow is with the arrow 
symbol instead of against it as in a normal PN-junction diode. This is because breakdown diodes are 
operated in the reverse-bias mode, which means the current flow is by minority current carriers. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">The Tunnel Diode 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In 1958, Leo Esaki, a Japanese scientist, discovered that if a semiconductor junction diode is heavily 
doped with impurities, it will have a region of negative resistance. The normal junction diode uses 
semiconductor materials that are lightly doped with one impurity atom for ten-million semiconductor 
atoms. This low doping level results in a relatively wide depletion region. Conduction occurs in the 
normal junction diode only if the voltage applied to it is large enough to overcome the potential barrier of 
the junction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the TUNNEL DIODE, the semiconductor materials used in forming a junction are doped to the 
extent of one-thousand impurity atoms for ten-million semiconductor atoms. This heavy doping produces 
an extremely narrow depletion zone similar to that in the Zener diode. Also because of the heavy doping, 
a tunnel diode exhibits an unusual current-voltage characteristic curve as compared with that of an 
ordinary junction diode. The characteristic curve for a tunnel diode is illustrated in figure 3-5. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The three most important aspects of this characteristic curve are (1) the forward current increase to a 
peak (IP) with a small applied forward bias, (2) the decreasing forward current with an increasing forward 
bias to a minimum valley current (IV), and (3) the normal increasing forward current with further 
increases in the bias voltage. The portion of the characteristic curve between IP and IV is the region of 
negative resistance. An explanation of why a tunnel diode has a region of negative resistance is best 
understood by using energy levels as in the previous explanation of the Zener effect.

</p><p class="paragraph">The size of the depletion region in a varactor diode is directly related to the bias. Forward biasing 
makes the region smaller by repelling the current carriers toward the PN junction. If the applied voltage is 
large enough (about .5 volt for silicon material), the negative particles will cross the junction and join 
with the positive particles, as shown in figure 3-13. This forward biasing causes the depletion region to 
decrease, producing a low resistance at the PN junction and a large current flow across it. This is the 
condition for a forward-biased diode. On the other hand, if reverse-bias voltage is applied to the PN 
junction, the size of its depletion region increases as the charged particles on both sides move away from 
the junction. This condition, shown in figure 3-14, produces a high resistance between the terminals and 
allows little current flow (only in the microampere range). This is the operating condition for the varactor 
diode, which is nothing more than a special PN junction.

the layer of dielectric material between the plates of a common capacitor. Furthermore, the formula used 
to calculate capacitance 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Where 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">A = plate area 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">K = a constant value 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">d = distance between plates 
</h3><p class="paragraph">can be applied to both the varactor and the capacitor. In this case, the size of the insulation gap of the 
varactor, or depletion region, is substituted for the distance between the plates of the capacitor. By 
varying the reverse-bias voltage applied to the varactor, the width of the "gap" may be varied. An increase 
in reverse bias increases the width of the gap (d) which reduces the capacitance (C) of the PN junction. 
Therefore, the capacitance of the varactor is inversely proportional to the applied reverse bias. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ratio of varactor capacitance to reverse-bias voltage change may be as high as 10 to 1. Figure 
3-15 shows one example of the voltage-to-capacitance ratio. View A shows that a reverse bias of 3 volts 
produces a capacitance of 20 picofarads in the varactor. If the reverse bias is increased to 6 volts, as 
shown in view B, the depletion region widens and capacitance drops to 5 picofarads. Each 1-volt increase 
in bias voltage causes a 5-picofarad decrease in the capacitance of the varactor; the ratio of change is 
therefore 5 to 1. Of course any decrease in applied bias voltage would cause a proportionate increase in 
capacitance, as the depletion region narrows. Notice that the value of the capacitance is small in the 
picofarad range. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">In general, varactors are used to replace the old style variable capacitor tuning. They are used in 
tuning circuits of more sophisticated communication equipment and in other circuits where variable 
capacitance is required. One advantage of the varactor is that it allows a dc voltage to be used to tune a 
circuit for simple remote control or automatic tuning functions. One such application of the varactor is as 
a variable tuning capacitor in a receiver or transmitter tank circuit like that shown in figure 3-16. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

times a minute; yet, some SCRs can be switched 25,000 times a second. It takes just microseconds 
(millionths of a second) to turn on or off these units. Varying the time that a switch is on as compared to 
the time that it is off regulates the amount of power flowing through the switch. Since most devices can 
operate on pulses of power (alternating current is a special form of alternating positive and negative 
pulse), the SCR can be used readily in control applications. Motor-speed controllers, inverters, remote 
switching units, controlled rectifiers, circuit overload protectors, latching relays, and computer logic 
circuits all use the SCR.

base of Q2. (Beta) 1 is the current gain of Q1, and (Beta) 2 is the current gain of Q2. The gain of this 
positive feedback loop is their product, 1 times 2. When the product is less than one, the circuit is stable; 
if the product is greater than unity, the circuit is regenerative. A small negative current applied to terminal 
G will bias the NPN transistor into cutoff, and the loop gain is less than unity. Under these conditions, the 
only current that can exist between output terminals A and C is the very small cutoff collector current of 
the two transistors. For this reason the impedance between A and C is very high. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When a positive current is applied to terminal G, transistor Q2 is biased into conduction, causing its 
collector current to rise. Since the current gain of Q2 increases with increased collector current, a point 
(called the breakover point) is reached where the loop gain equals unity and the circuit becomes 
regenerative. At this point, collector current of the two transistors rapidly increases to a value limited only 
by the external circuit. Both transistors are driven into saturation, and the impedance between A and C is 
very low. The positive current applied to terminal G, which served to trigger the self-regenerative action, 
is no longer required since the collector of PNP transistor Q1 now supplies more than enough current to 
drive Q2. The circuit will remain on until it is turned off by a reduction in the collector current to a value 
below that necessary to maintain conduction. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The characteristic curve for the SCR is shown in figure 3-19. With no gate current, the leakage 
current remains very small as the forward voltage from cathode to anode is increased until the breakdown 
point is reached. Here the center junction breaks down, the SCR begins to conduct heavily, and the drop

tube, normally gas filled, that uses a filament or a heater. The SCR and the thyratron function in a very 
similar manner. Figure 3-21 shows the schematic of each with the corresponding elements labeled. In 
both types of devices, control by the input signal is lost after they are triggered. The control grid 
(thyratron) and the gate (SCR) have no further effect on the magnitude of the load current after 
conduction begins. The load current can be interrupted by one or more of three methods: (1) the load 
circuit must be opened by a switch, (2) the plate (anode) voltage must be reduced below the ionizing 
potential of the gas (thyratron), (3) the forward-bias current must be reduced below a minimum value 
required to sustain conduction (SCR). The input resistance of the SCR is relatively low (approximately 
100 ohms) and requires a current for triggering; the input resistance of the thyratron is exceptionally high, 
and requires a voltage input to the grid for triggering action.

this semiconductor device its name. When alternating current is applied to a rectifier, only the positive or 
negative halves of the sine wave flow through. All of each positive or negative half cycle appears in the 
output. When an SCR is used, however, the controlled rectifier may be turned on at any time during the 
half cycle, thus controlling the amount of dc power available from zero to maximum, as shown in figure 
3-22. Since the output is actually dc pulses, suitable filtering can be added if continuous direct current is 
needed. Thus any dc operated device can have controlled amounts of power applied to it. Notice that the 
SCR must be turned on at the desired time for each cycle. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the light-emitting diode (LED), was developed to replace the fragile, short-life incandescent light bulbs 
used to indicate on/off conditions on panels. A LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE is a diode which, when 
forward biased, produces visible light. The light may be red, green, or amber, depending upon the 
material used to make the diode. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-27 shows an LED and its schematic symbol. The LED is designated by a standard diode 
symbol with two arrows pointing away from the cathode. The arrows indicate light leaving the diode. The 
circuit symbols for all optoelectronic devices have arrows pointing either toward them, if they use light, 
or away from them, if they produce light. The LED operating voltage is small, about 1.6 volts forward 
bias and generally about 10 milliamperes. The life expectancy of the LED is very long, over 100,000 
hours of operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">LEDs are used widely as "power on" indicators of current and as displays for pocket calculators, 
digital voltmeters, frequency counters, etc. For use in calculators and similar devices, LEDs are typically 
placed together in seven-segment displays, as shown in figure 3-28 (view A and view B). This display </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Another special optoelectronic device in common use today is the photodiode. Unlike the LED, 
which produces light, the photodiode uses light to accomplish special circuit functions. Basically, the 
PHOTODIODE is a light-controlled variable resistor. In total darkness, it has a relatively high resistance 
and therefore conducts little current. However, when the PN junction is exposed to an external light 
source, internal resistance decreases and current flow increases. The photodiode is operated with 
reverse-bias and conducts current in direct proportion to the intensity of the light source. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-31 shows a photodiode with its schematic symbol. The arrows pointing toward the symbol 
indicate that light is required for operation of the device. A light source is aimed at the photodiode 
through a transparent "window" placed over the semiconductor chip. Switching the light source on or off 
changes the conduction level of the photodiode. Varying the light intensity controls the amount of 
conduction. Because photodiodes respond quickly to changes in light intensity, they are extremely useful 
in digital applications such as computer card readers, paper tape readers, and photographic light meters. 
They are also used in some types of optical scanning equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">A second optoelectronic device that conducts current when exposed to light is the 
PHOTOTRANSISTOR. A phototransistor, however, is much more sensitive to light and produces more 
output current for a given light intensity that does a photodiode. Figure 3-32 shows one type of 
phototransistor, which is made by placing a photodiode in the base circuit of an NPN transistor. Light 
falling on the photodiode changes the base current of the transistor, causing the collector current to be 
amplified. Phototransistors may also be of the PNP type, with the photodiode placed in the base-collector 
circuit. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-33 illustrates the schematic symbols for the various types of phototransistors. 
Phototransistors may be of the two-terminal type, in which the light intensity on the photodiode alone 
determines the amount of conduction. They may also be of the three-terminal type, which have an added 
base lead that allows an electrical bias to be applied to the base. The bias allows an optimum transistor 
conduction level, and thus compensates for ambient (normal room) light intensity.

</p><p class="paragraph">An older device that uses light in a way similar to the photodiode is the photoconductive cell, or 
PHOTOCELL, shown with its schematic symbol in figure 3-34. Like the photodiode, the photocell is a 
light-controlled variable resistor. However, a typical light-to-dark resistance ratio for a photocell is 
1:1000. This means that its resistance could range from 1000 ohms in the light to 1000 kilohms in the 
dark, or from 2000 ohms in the light to 2000 kilohms in the dark, and so forth. Of course, other ratios are 
also available. Photocells are used in various types of control and timing circuits as, for example, the 
automatic street light controllers in most cities. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

example of a solar cell and its schematic symbol are shown in figure 3-35. The symbol is similar to that of 
a battery. The device itself acts much like a battery when exposed to light and produces about .45 volt 
across its terminals, with current capacity determined by its size. As with batteries, solar cells may be 
connected in series or parallel to produce higher voltages and currents. The device is finding widespread 
application in communications satellites and solar-powered homes. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When it is necessary to block the voltage between one electronic circuit and another, and transfer the 
signal at the same time, an amplifier coupling capacitor is often used as shown in figure 3-36. Although 
this method of coupling does block dc between the circuits, voltage isolation is not complete. A newer 
method, making use of optoelectronic devices to achieve electrical isolation, is the optical coupler, shown 
in figure 3-37. The coupler is composed of an LED and a photodiode contained in a light-conducting 
medium. As the polarity signs in figure 3-37 show, the LED is forward biased, while the photodiode is 
reverse biased. When the input signal causes current through the LED to increase, the light produce by the 
LED increases. This increased light intensity causes current flow through the photodiode to increase. In 
this way, changes in input current produce proportional changes in the output, even though the two 
circuits are electrically isolated. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

be explained. As with diodes, a discussion of all the developments in the transistor field would be 
impossible. The unijunction transistor (UJT) and the field effect transistor (FET) will be discussed 
because of their widespread application in Navy equipment. Many other special transistors have been 
developed and will be discussed in later NEETS modules.

terminal, solid-state device that has several advantages over conventional transistors. It is very stable over 
a wide range of temperatures and allows a reduction of components when used in place of conventional 
transistors. A comparison is shown in figure 3-38. View A is a circuit using conventional transistors, and 
view B is the same circuit using the UJT. As you can see, the UJT circuit has fewer components. 
Reducing the number of components reduces the cost, size, and probability of failure.

material, forms the main body of the device. Diffused into each side of this bar are two deposits of 
material of the opposite type from the bar material, which form the "gate." The portion of the bar between 
the deposits of gate material is of a smaller cross section than the rest of the bar and forms a "channel" 
connecting the source and the drain. Figure 3-45 shows a bar of N-type material and a gate of P-type 
material. Because the material in the channel is N-type, the device is called an N-channel JFET. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">In a P-channel JFET, the channel is made of P-type material and the gate of N-type material. In 
figure 3-46, schematic symbols for the two types of JFET are compared with those of the NPN and PNP 
bipolar transistors. Like the bipolar transistor types, the two types of JFET differ only in the configuration 
of bias voltages required and in the direction of the arrow within the symbol. Just as it does in transistor 
symbols, the arrow in a JFET symbol always points towards the N-type material. Thus the symbol of the 
N-channel JFET shows the arrow pointing toward the drain/source channel, whereas the P-channel 
symbol shows the arrow pointing away from the drain/source channel toward the gate. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The key to FET operation is the effective cross-sectional area of the channel, which can be controlled 
by variations in the voltage applied to the gate. This is demonstrated in the figures which follow. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-47 shows how the JFET operates in a zero gate bias condition. Five volts are applied across 
the JFET so that current flows through the bar from source to drain, as indicated by the arrow. The gate 
terminal is tied to ground. This is a zero gate bias condition. In this condition, a typical bar represents a 
resistance of about 500 ohms. A milliammeter, connected in series with the drain lead and dc power, 
indicates the amount of current flow. With a drain supply (VDD) of 5 volts, the milliammeter gives a drain 
current (ID) reading of 10 milliamperes. The voltage and current subscript letters (V DD, ID) used for an 
FET correspond to the elements of the FET just as they do for the elements of transistors. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-48, a small reverse-bias voltage is applied to the gate of the JFET. A gate-source voltage 
(VGG) of negative 1 volt applied to the P-type gate material causes the junction between the P- and N-type 
material to become reverse biased. Just as it did in the varactor diode, a reverse-bias condition causes a </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

of current carriers, the effect of reverse biasing is to reduce the effective cross-sectional area of the 
"channel." This reduction in area increases the source-to-drain resistance of the device and decreases 
current flow. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The application of a large enough negative voltage to the gate will cause the depletion region to 
become so large that conduction of current through the bar stops altogether. The voltage required to 
reduce drain current (ID) to zero is called "pinch-off" voltage and is comparable to "cut-off" voltage in a 
vacuum tube. In figure 3-48, the negative 1 volt applied, although not large enough to completely stop 
conduction, has caused the drain current to decrease markedly (from 10 milliamperes under zero gate bias 
conditions to 5 milliamperes). Calculation shows that the 1-volt gate bias has also increased the resistance 
of the JFET (from 500 ohms to 1 kilohm). In other words, a 1-volt change in gate voltage has doubled the 
resistance of the device and cut current flow in half. 
</p><p class="paragraph">These measurements, however, show only that a JFET operates in a manner similar to a bipolar 
transistor, even though the two are constructed differently. As stated before, the main advantage of an 
FET is that its input impedance is significantly higher than that of a bipolar transistor. The higher input 
impedance of the JFET under reverse gate bias conditions can be seen by connecting a microammeter in 
series with the gate-source voltage (V GG), as shown in figure 3-49. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">With a VGG of 1 volt, the microammeter reads .5 microamps. Applying Ohm's law (1V ÷ .5 µA) 
illustrates that this very small amount of current flow results in a very high input impedance (about 2 
megohms). By contrast, a bipolar transistor in similar circumstances would require higher current flow 
(e.g., .1 to −1 mA), resulting in a much lower input impedance (about 1000 ohms or less). The higher 
input impedance of the JFET is possible because of the way reverse-bias gate voltage affects the cross-
sectional area of the channel.

</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-51 shows a basic common-source amplifier circuit containing an N-channel JFET. The 
characteristics of this circuit include high input impedance and a high voltage gain. The function of the 
circuit components in this figure is very similar to those in a triode vacuum tube common-cathode 
amplifier circuit. C1 and C3 are the input and output coupling capacitors. R1 is the gate return resistor and 
functions much like the grid return resistor in a vacuum tube circuit. It prevents unwanted charge buildup 
on the gate by providing a discharge path for C1. R2 and C2 provide source self-bias for the JFET, which 
operates like cathode self-bias. R3 is the drain load resistor, which acts like the plate or collector load 
resistor. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The phase shift of 180 degrees between input and output signals is the same as that of common-
cathode vacuum tube circuits (and common-emitter transistor circuits). The reason for the phase shift can 
be seen easily by observing the operation of the N-channel JFET. On the positive alternation of the input 
signal, the amount of reverse bias on the P-type gate material is reduced, thus increasing the effective 
cross-sectional area of the channel and decreasing source-to-drain resistance. When resistance decreases, 
current flow through the JFET increases. This increase causes the voltage drop across R3 to increase, 
which in turn causes the drain voltage to decrease. On the negative alternation of the cycle, the amount of 
reverse bias on the gate of the JFET is increased and the action of the circuit is reversed. The result is an 
output signal, which is an amplified 180-degree-out-of-phase version of the input signal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A second type of field-effect transistor has been introduced in recent years that has some advantages 
over the JFET. This device is the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). The 
MOSFET has an even higher input impedance than the JFET (10 to 100 million megohms). Therefore, 
the MOSFET is even less of a load on preceding circuits. The extremely high input impedance, combined 
with a high gain factor, makes the MOSFET a highly efficient input device for RF/IF amplifiers and 
mixers and for many types of test equipment. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The MOSFET is normally constructed so that it operates in one of two basic modes: the depletion 
mode or the enhancement mode. The depletion mode MOSFET has a heavily doped channel and uses 
reverse bias on the gate to cause a depletion of current carriers in the channel. The JFET also operates in 
this manner. The enhancement mode MOSFET has a lightly doped channel and uses forward bias to </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

(indicated by the N+) are diffused into a P-type substrate or base. A channel of regular N-type material is 
diffused between the heavily doped N-type regions. A metal oxide insulating layer is then formed over 
the channel, and a metal gate layer is deposited over the insulating layer. There is no electrical connection 
between the gate and the rest of the device. This construction method results in the extremely high input

potential is at zero volts. A voltage is applied to the gate in the second method. An electric field is formed 
by the gate voltage that affects the current flow in the channel by either depleting or enhancing the 
number of current carriers available. As previously stated, a reverse bias applied to the gate depletes the 
carriers, and a forward bias enhances the carriers. The polarity of the voltages required to forward or 
reverse bias a MOSFET depends upon whether it is of the P-channel type or the N-channel type. The

</p><p class="paragraph">The induced-channel MOSFET is caused to conduct from source to drain by the electric field that is 
created when a voltage is applied to the gate. For example, assume that a negative voltage is applied to 
the MOSFET in figure 3-56. The effect of the negative voltage modifies the conditions in the substrate 
material. As the gate builds a negative charge, free electrons are repelled, forming a depletion region. 
Once a certain level of depletion has occurred (determined by the composition of the substrate material), 
any additional gate bias attracts positive holes to the surface of the substrate. When enough holes have 
accumulated at the surface channel area, the channel changes from an N-type material to a P-type 
material, since it now has more positive carriers than negative carriers. At this point the channel is 
considered to be to inverted, and the two P-type regions at the source and the drain are now connected by 
a P-type inversion layer or channel. As with the MOSFET, the gate signal determines the amount of 
current flow through the channel as long as the source and drain voltages remain constant. When the gate 
voltage is at zero, essentially no current flows since a gate voltage is required to form a channel. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The MOSFETs discussed up to this point have been single-gate MOSFETs. Another type of 
MOSFET, the dual-gate type, is shown in figure 3-57. As the figure shows, the gates in a dual-gate 
MOSFET can be compared to the grids in a multi-grid vacuum tube. Because the substrate has been 
connected directly to the source terminal, the dual-gate MOSFET still has only four leads: one each for 
source and drain, and two for the gates. Either gate can control conduction independently, making this 
type of MOSFET a truly versatile device.

packaged with their leads shorted together by a special wire loop or spring to avoid accidental damage. 
The rule to remember with these shorting springs is that they must not be removed until after the 
MOSFET has been soldered or plugged into a circuit. One such spring is shown in figure 3-58.

</h1><p class="paragraph">This chapter introduced you to a representative selection of solid-state devices that have special 
properties. The basic operating principles of the devices discussed in this chapter are summarized in the 
following paragraphs for you to use as a review and a future reference. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ZENER DIODE is a PN junction that is designed to operate in the reverse-bias breakdown 
mode. When the applied voltage reaches the breakdown point, the Zener diode, for all practical purposes, 
becomes a short circuit. The reverse bias and breakdown mode of operation cause the Zener diode to 
conduct with (in the direction of) the arrow in the symbol as shown. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Two theories are used to explain the breakdown action of Zener diodes. The ZENER EFFECT 
explains the breakdown of diodes below 5 volts. The heavy doping used in these diodes allows the 
valence band of one material to overlap the energy level of the conduction band of the other material. 
This situation allows electrons to tunnel across the PN junction at the point where the two energy bands 
overlap. Zener diodes that operate above 5 volts are explained by the AVALANCHE EFFECT in which 
free electrons colliding with bound electrons cause an ever-increasing number of free current carriers in a 
multiplying action. The Zener diode is used primarily as a voltage regulator in electronic circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The TUNNEL DIODE is a heavily doped PN junction that exhibits negative resistance over part of 
its range of operation, as can be seen in the curve in the illustration. The heavy doping causes the tunnel 
diode to have a very narrow depletion region and also causes the valence band of one of the 
semiconductor materials to overlap the energy level of the conduction band of the other semiconductor 
material. At the energy overlap point, electrons can cross from the valence band of one material to the 
conduction band of the other material without acquiring any additional energy. This action is called 
tunneling. Tunnel diodes are used as amplifiers, oscillators, and high-speed switching devices. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The SILICON CONTROLLED RECTIFIER (SCR) is a four-element, solid-state device that 
combines characteristics of both diodes and transistors. The symbol for the SCR is shown below. A signal 
must be applied to the gate to cause the SCR to conduct. When the proper gate signal is applied, the SCR 
conducts or "fires" until the bias potential across the device drops below the minimum required to sustain 
current flow. Removal of the gate signal does not shut off the SCR. In fact, the gate signal is often a very 
narrow voltage pulse or trigger. The SCR is ideal for use in situations where a small, low-power gate can 
be used to turn on larger currents, such as those found in rectifier and switching circuits. SCRs are used 
extensively in power supply circuits as rectifiers. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICES are of two basic types: light producers or light users. The LED is 
the most widely used light-producing device. When the LED is forward biased it emits energy in the form 
of light. LEDs are used in several configurations as digital equipment readout displays. The 
PHOTODIODE, the PHOTOTRANSISTOR, and the PHOTOCELL are all devices that use light to 
modify conduction through them. The SOLAR CELL uses light to produce voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The UNIJUNCTION TRANSISTOR (UJT) is a three-terminal, solid-state device with only one 
PN junction. The block diagram below shows the difference in construction between normal transistors 
and the UJT. The area between base 1 and base 2 of the UJT acts as a variable resister. The emitter of the 
UJT acts as the wiper arm. The sequential rise in voltage between the bases is called a voltage gradient. 
The UJT conducts when the emitter is more positive than the voltage gradient at the emitter/base contact 
point. There are many variations of the UJT which are used in switching circuits, oscillators, and wave-
shaping circuits. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTOR combines the high input impedance of the vacuum tube with 
all the other advantages of the transistor. The elements of the FET are the gate, source, and drain, which 
are comparable to the base, emitter, and collector of a standard transistor. The JFET or "junction FET" is 
made of a solid bar of either P- or N-semiconductor material, and the gate is made of the opposite type 
material, as illustrated below. The FET is called P-channel or N-channel depending upon the type of 
material used to make the bar between the source and drain. Voltage applied to the gate controls the width 
of the channel and consequently controls the current flow from the source to the drain. The JFET is 
normally operated with reverse bias that controls the channel width by increasing or decreasing the 
depletion region. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As illustrated in view B of figure 4-1, the first section is the TRANSFORMER. The transformer 
steps up or steps down the input line voltage and isolates the power supply from the power line. The 
RECTIFIER section converts the alternating current input signal to a pulsating direct current. However, as 
you proceed in this chapter you will learn that pulsating dc is not desirable. For this reason a FILTER 
section is used to convert pulsating dc to a purer, more desirable form of dc voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The final section, the REGULATOR, does just what the name implies. It maintains the output of the 
power supply at a constant level in spite of large changes in load current or input line voltages. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now that you know what each section does, let's trace an ac signal through the power supply. At this 
point you need to see how this signal is altered within each section of the power supply. Later on in the 
chapter you will see how these changes take place. In view B of figure 4-1, an input signal of 115 volts ac 
is applied to the primary of the transformer. The transformer is a step-up transformer with a turns ratio of 
1:3. You can calculate the output for this transformer by multiplying the input voltage by the ratio of turns 
in the primary to the ratio of turns in the secondary; therefore, 115 volts ac × 3 = 345 volts ac (peak-to-
peak) at the output. Because each diode in the rectifier section conducts for 180 degrees of the 360-degree 
input, the output of the rectifier will be one-half, or approximately 173 volts of pulsating dc. The filter 
section, a network of resistors, capacitors, or inductors, controls the rise and fall time of the varying 
signal; consequently, the signal remains at a more constant dc level. You will see the filter process more 
clearly in the discussion of the actual filter circuits. The output of the filter is a signal of 110 volts dc, 
with ac ripple riding on the dc. The reason for the lower voltage (average voltage) will be explained later 
in this chapter. The regulator maintains its output at a constant 110-volt dc level, which is used by the 
electronic equipment (more commonly called the load).

</h2><p class="paragraph">In some cases a power supply may not use a transformer; therefore, the power supply would be 
connected directly to the source line voltage. This type of connection is used primarily because it is 
economical. However, unless the power supply is completely insulated, it presents a dangerous shock 
hazard to anyone who comes in contact with it. When a transformer is not being used, the return side of 
the ac line is connected to the metal chassis. To remove this potential shock hazard and to have the option 
of stepping up or stepping down the input voltage to the rectifier, a transformer must be used.

STEP-DOWN transformer; and, view C shows a STEP-UP, CENTER-TAPPED transformer. The step-up

transformer will be mentioned in this chapter. The primary purpose of the center-tapped transformer is to 
provide two equal voltages to the conventional full-wave rectifier.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-RECTIFIER-4-4-">THE RECTIFIER 
</h2><p class="paragraph">From previous discussions, you should know that rectification is the conversion of an alternating 
current to a pulsating direct current. Now let's see how the process of RECTIFICATION occurs in both a 
half-wave and a full-wave rectifier. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Half-Wave Rectifier 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Since a silicon diode will pass current in only one direction, it is ideally suited for converting 
alternating current (ac) to direct current (dc). When ac voltage is applied to a diode, the diode conducts 
ONLY ON THE POSITIVE ALTERNATION OF VOLTAGE; that is, when the anode of the diode is 
positive with respect to the cathode. This simplest type of rectifier is the half-wave rectifier. As shown in 
view A of figure 4-3, the half-wave rectifier uses only one diode. During the positive alternation of input 
voltage, the sine wave applied to the diode makes the anode positive with respect to the cathode. The 
diode then conducts, and current (I) flows from the negative supply lead (the secondary of the 
transformer), through the milliammeter, through the diode, and to the positive supply lead. As indicated 
by the shaded area of the output waveform in view B, this current exists during the entire period of time 
that the anode is positive with respect to the cathode (in other words, for the first 180 degrees of the input 
sine wave).

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">During the negative alternation of input voltage (dotted polarity signs), the anode is driven negative 
and the diode cannot conduct. When conditions such as these exist, the diode is in cutoff and remains in 
cutoff for 180 degrees, during which time no current flows in the circuit. The circuit current therefore has 
the appearance of a series of positive pulses, as illustrated by the shaded areas on the waveform in view 
B. Notice that although the current is in the form of pulses, the current always flows in the same direction. 
Current that flows in pulses in the same direction is called PULSATING DC. The diode has thus 
RECTIFIED the ac input voltage. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Rms, Peak, and Average Values 
</h3><p class="paragraph">View A of figure 4-4 is a comparison of the rms, peak, and average values of the types of waveforms 
associated with the half-wave rectifier. Ac voltages are normally specified in terms of their rms values. 
Thus, when a 115-volt ac power source is mentioned in this chapter, it is specifying the rms value of 115 
volts ac. In terms of peak values, 
</p><p class="paragraph">Erms = Epeak × .707 
</p><p class="paragraph">The peak value is always higher than the rms value. In fact, 
</p><p class="paragraph">Epeak = Erms × 1.414 
</p><p class="paragraph">therefore, if the rms value is 115 volts ac, then the peak value must be: 
</p><p class="paragraph">Epeak = Erms × 1.414 
</p><p class="paragraph">Epeak = 115 volts ac × 1.414

changes when the negative portion of the sine wave is clipped off. Since the wave form swings positive 
but never negative (past the "zero-volt" reference line), the average voltage is positive. The average 
voltage (Eavg) is determined by the equation: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Where: Eavg  = Epeak × .318

</p><h3 class="subsection">Ripple Frequency 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The half-wave rectifier gets its name from the fact that it conducts during only half the input cycle. 
Its output is a series of pulses with a frequency that is the same as the input frequency. Thus when 
operated from a 60-hertz line, the frequency of the pulses is 60 hertz. This is called RIPPLE 
FREQUENCY.

</p><h3 class="subsection">The Conventional Full-Wave Rectifier 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A full-wave rectifier is a device that has two or more diodes arranged so that load current flows in 
the same direction during each half cycle of the ac supply. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A diagram of a simple full-wave rectifier is shown in figure 4-5. The transformer supplies the source 
voltage for two diode rectifiers, D1 and D2. This power transformer has a center-tapped, high-voltage 
secondary winding that is divided into two equal parts (W1 and W2). W1 provides the source voltage for 
D1, and W2 provides the source voltage for D2. The connections to the diodes are arranged so that the 
diodes conduct on alternate half cycles. 
</p><p class="paragraph">During one alternation of the secondary voltage, the polarities are as shown in view A. The source 
for D2 is the voltage induced into the lower half of the secondary winding of the transformer (W2). At the 
specific instant of time shown in the figure, the anode voltage on D2 is negative, and D2 cannot conduct. 
Throughout the period of time during which the anode of D2 is negative, the anode of D1 is positive. 
Since the anode of D1 is positive, it conducts, causing current to flow through the load resistor in the 
direction shown by the arrow. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">View B shows the next half cycle of secondary voltage. Now the polarities across W1 and W2 are 
reversed. During this alternation, the anode of D1 is driven negative and D1 cannot conduct. For the 
period of time that the anode of D1 is negative, the anode of D2 is positive, permitting D2 to conduct. 
Notice that the anode current of D2 passes through the load resistor in the same direction as the current of 
D1 did. In this circuit arrangement, a pulse of load current flows during each alternation of the input 
cycle. Since both alternations of the input voltage cycle are used, the circuit is called a FULL-WAVE 
RECTIFIER. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">A practical full-wave rectifier circuit is shown in view A of figure 4-6. It uses two diodes (D1 and 
D2) and a center-tapped transformer (T1). When the center tap is grounded, the voltages at the opposite 
ends of the secondary windings are 180 degrees out of phase with each other. Thus, when the voltage at 
point A is positive with respect to ground, the voltage at point B is negative with respect to ground. Let's 
examine the operation of the circuit during one complete cycle.

pulses of current (or voltage) for each cycle of input voltage. The ripple frequency at the output of the 
full-wave rectifier is therefore twice the line frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The higher frequency at the output of a full-wave rectifier offers a distinct advantage: Because of the 
higher ripple frequency, the output is closely approximate to pure dc. The higher frequency also makes 
filtering much easier than it is for the output of the half-wave rectifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In terms of peak value, the average value of current and voltage at the output of the full-wave

disadvantages. The full-wave rectifier is no exception. In studying the full-wave rectifier, you may have 
found that by doubling the output frequency, the average voltage has doubled, and the resulting signal is 
much easier to filter because of the high ripple frequency. The only disadvantage is that the peak voltage 
in the full-wave rectifier is only half the peak voltage in the half-wave rectifier. This is because the 
secondary of the power transformer in the full-wave rectifier is center tapped; therefore, only half the

</p><p class="paragraph">One complete cycle of operation will be discussed to help you understand how this circuit works. We 
have discussed transformers in previous modules in the NEETS series and will not go into their 
characteristics at this time. Let us assume the transformer is working properly and there is a positive 
potential at point A and a negative potential at point B. The positive potential at point A will forward bias 
D3 and reverse bias D4. The negative potential at point B will forward bias D1 and reverse bias D2. At 
this time D3 and D1 are forward biased and will allow current flow to pass through them; D4 and D2 are 
reverse biased and will block current flow. The path for current flow is from point B through D1, up 
through RL, through D3, through the secondary of the transformer back to point B. This path is indicated 
by the solid arrows. Waveforms (1) and (2) can be observed across D1 and D3. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One-half cycle later the polarity across the secondary of the transformer reverses, forward biasing D2 
and D4 and reverse biasing D1 and D3. Current flow will now be from point A through D4, up through 
RL, through D2, through the secondary of T1, and back to point A. This path is indicated by the broken 
arrows. Waveforms (3) and (4) can be observed across D2 and D4. You should have noted that the current 
flow through R L is always in the same direction. In flowing through R L this current develops a voltage 
corresponding to that shown in waveform (5). Since current flows through the load (RL) during both half 
cycles of the applied voltage, this bridge rectifier is a full-wave rectifier. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One advantage of a bridge rectifier over a conventional full-wave rectifier is that with a given 
transformer the bridge rectifier produces a voltage output that is nearly twice that of the conventional full-
wave circuit. This may be shown by assigning values to some of the components shown in views A and B 
of figure 4-9. Assume that the same transformer is used in both circuits. The peak voltage developed 
between points X and Y is 1000 volts in both circuits. In the conventional full-wave circuit shown in view 
A, the peak voltage from the center tap to either X or Y is 500 volts. Since only one diode can conduct at 
any instant, the maximum voltage that can be rectified at any instant is 500 volts. Therefore, the 
maximum voltage that appears across the load resistor is nearly — but never exceeds — 500 volts, as a 
result of the small voltage drop across the diode. In the bridge rectifier shown in view B, the maximum 
voltage that can be rectified is the full secondary voltage, which is 1000 volts. Therefore, the peak output </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Filtering is accomplished by the use of capacitors, inductors, and/or resistors in various 
combinations. Inductors are used as series impedances to oppose the flow of alternating (pulsating dc) 
current. Capacitors are used as shunt elements to bypass the alternating components of the signal around 
the load (to ground). Resistors are used in place of inductors in low current applications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's briefly review the properties of a capacitor. First, a capacitor opposes any change in voltage. 
The opposition to a change in current is called capacitive reactance (XC) and is measured in ohms. The 
capacitive reactance is determined by the frequency (f) of the applied voltage and the capacitance (C) of 
the capacitor. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">From the formula, you can see that if frequency or capacitance is increased, the XC decreases. Since 
filter capacitors are placed in parallel with the load, a low XC will provide better filtering than a high XC. 
For this to be accomplished, a better shunting effect of the ac around the load is provided, as shown in 
figure 4-10. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To obtain a steady dc output, the capacitor must charge almost instantaneously to the value of 
applied voltage. Once charged, the capacitor must retain the charge as long as possible. The capacitor 
must have a short charge time constant (view A). This can be accomplished by keeping the internal 
resistance of the power supply as small as possible (fast charge time) and the resistance of the load as 
large as possible (for a slow discharge time as illustrated in view B).

Another way to look at it is: The capacitor acts as a short circuit around the load (as far as the ac

OPPOSES ANY CHANGE IN CURRENT. In case you have forgotten, a change in current through an 
inductor produces a changing electromagnetic field. The changing field, in turn, cuts the windings of the 
wire in the inductor and thereby produces a counter electromotive force (CEMF). It is the CEMF that 
opposes the change in circuit current. Opposition to a change in current at a given frequency is called 
inductive reactance (XL) and is measured in ohms. The inductive reactance (XL) of an inductor is 
determined by the applied frequency and the inductance of the inductor.

the change in current. When the rectifier current decreases, as shown in figure 4-14, the magnetic field 
collapses and again cuts the turns (windings) of wire, thus inducing current into the coil. This additional

</p><h3 class="subsection">The Capacitor Filter 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The simple capacitor filter is the most basic type of power supply filter. The application of the 
simple capacitor filter is very limited. It is sometimes used on extremely high-voltage, low-current power 
supplies for cathode-ray and similar electron tubes, which require very little load current from the supply. 
The capacitor filter is also used where the power-supply ripple frequency is not critical; this frequency 
can be relatively high. The capacitor (C1) shown in figure 4-15 is a simple filter connected across the 
output of the rectifier in parallel with the load. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When this filter is used, the RC charge time of the filter capacitor (C1) must be short and the RC 
discharge time must be long to eliminate ripple action. In other words, the capacitor must charge up fast, 
preferably with no discharge at all. Better filtering also results when the input frequency is high; 
therefore, the full-wave rectifier output is easier to filter than that of the half-wave rectifier because of its 
higher frequency.

indicates the average value of output voltage. For the half-wave rectifier, Eavg is less than half (or 
approximately 0.318) of the peak output voltage. This value is still much less than that of the applied 
voltage. With no capacitor connected across the output of the rectifier circuit, the waveform in view A has 
a large pulsating component (ripple) compared with the average or dc component. When a capacitor is 
connected across the output (view B), the average value of output voltage (Eavg) is increased due to the

relatively low. Therefore, the RC charge time of the circuit is relatively short. As a result, when the

discharges through the load resistance (RL) during the time the rectifier is nonconducting. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The rate of discharge of the capacitor is determined by the value of capacitance and the value of the 
load resistance. If the capacitance and load-resistance values are large, the RC discharge time for the 
circuit is relatively long. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A comparison of the waveforms shown in figure 4-16 (view A and view B) illustrates that the 
addition of C1 to the circuit results in an increase in the average of the output voltage (Eavg) and a 
reduction in the amplitude of the ripple component (Er) which is normally present across the load 
resistance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, let's consider a complete cycle of operation using a half-wave rectifier, a capacitive filter (C1), 
and a load resistor (RL). As shown in view A of figure 4-17, the capacitive filter (C1) is assumed to be 
large enough to ensure a small reactance to the pulsating rectified current. The resistance of RL is assumed 
to be much greater than the reactance of C1 at the input frequency. When the circuit is energized, the 
diode conducts on the positive half cycle and current flows through the circuit, allowing C1 to charge. C1 
will charge to approximately the peak value of the input voltage. (The charge is less than the peak value 
because of the voltage drop across the diode (D1)). In view A of the figure, the charge on C1 is indicated 
by the heavy solid line on the waveform. As illustrated in view B, the diode cannot conduct on the 
negative half cycle because the anode of D1 is negative with respect to the cathode. During this interval, 
C1 discharges through the load resistor (RL). The discharge of C1 produces the downward slope as 
indicated by the solid line on the waveform in view B. In contrast to the abrupt fall of the applied ac 
voltage from peak value to zero, the voltage across C1 (and thus across RL) during the discharge period 
gradually decreases until the time of the next half cycle of rectifier operation. Keep in mind that for good 
filtering, the filter capacitor should charge up as fast as possible and discharge as little as possible.

</p><p class="paragraph">Since practical values of C1 and RL ensure a more or less gradual decrease of the discharge voltage, 
a substantial charge remains on the capacitor at the time of the next half cycle of operation. As a result, no 
current can flow through the diode until the rising ac input voltage at the anode of the diode exceeds the 
voltage on the charge remaining on C1. The charge on C1 is the cathode potential of the diode. When the

and C1 begins to charge to approximately the peak value of the applied voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">After the capacitor has charged to its peak value, the diode will cut off and the capacitor will start to 
discharge. Since the fall of the ac input voltage on the anode is considerably more rapid than the decrease 
on the capacitor voltage, the cathode quickly become more positive than the anode, and the diode ceases 
to conduct.

half cycle. (Note that each diode conducts only for that portion of time when the peak secondary voltage

impedance of the capacitor by one-half. This allows the ac component to pass through the capacitor more 
easily. As a result, a full-wave rectifier output is much easier to filter than that of a half-wave rectifier. 
Remember, the smaller the XC of the filter capacitor with respect to the load resistance, the better the 
filtering action. Since

important consideration. If load resistance is made small, the load current increases, and the average value 
of output voltage (Eavg) decreases. The RC discharge time constant is a direct function of the value of the 
load resistance; therefore, the rate of capacitor voltage discharge is a direct function of the current through 
the load. The greater the load current, the more rapid the discharge of the capacitor, and the lower the 
average value of output voltage. For this reason, the simple capacitive filter is seldom used with rectifier 
circuits that must supply a relatively large load current. Using the simple capacitive filter in conjunction 
with a full-wave or bridge rectifier provides improved filtering because the increased ripple frequency 
decreases the capacitive reactance of the filter capacitor.

</p><h3 class="subsection">LC Choke-Input Filter 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The LC choke-input filter is used primarily in power supplies where voltage regulation is important 
and where the output current is relatively high and subject to varying load conditions. This filter is used in 
high power applications such as those found in radars and communication transmitters. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice in figure 4-19 that this filter consists of an input inductor (L1), or filter choke, and an output 
filter capacitor (C1). Inductor L1 is placed at the input to the filter and is in series with the output of the 
rectifier circuit. Since the action of an inductor is to oppose any change in current flow, the inductor tends 
to keep a constant current flowing to the load throughout the complete cycle of the applied voltage. As a 
result, the output voltage never reaches the peak value of the applied voltage. Instead, the output voltage 
approximates the average value of the rectified input to the filter, as shown in the figure. The reactance of 
the inductor (XL) reduces the amplitude of ripple voltage without reducing the dc output voltage by an 
appreciable amount. (The dc resistance of the inductor is just a few ohms.) 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The shunt capacitor (C1) charges and discharges at the ripple frequency rate, but the amplitude of the 
ripple voltage (Er) is relatively small because the inductor (L1) tends to keep a constant current flowing 
from the rectifier circuit to the load. In addition, the reactance of the shunt capacitor (XC) presents a low 
impedance to the ripple component existing at the output of the filter, and thus shunts the ripple 
component around the load. The capacitor attempts to hold the output voltage relatively constant at the 
average value of the voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The value of the filter capacitor (C1) must be relatively large to present a low opposition (XC) to the 
pulsating current and to store a substantial charge. The rate of the charge for the capacitor is limited by 
the low impedance of the ac source (the transformer), by the small resistance of the diode, and by the 
counter electromotive force (CEMF) developed by the coil. Therefore, the RC charge time constant is 
short compared to its discharge time. (This comparison in RC charge and discharge paths is illustrated in </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

choke-input filter, the inductor (L1) produces a CEMF which opposes the constantly increasing input 
voltage. The net result is to effectively prevent the rapid charging of the filter capacitor (C1). Thus, 
instead of reaching the peak value of the input voltage, C1 only charges to the average value of the input 
voltage. After the input voltage reaches its peak and decreases sufficiently, the capacitor C1) attempts to 
discharge through the load resistance RL). C1 will only partially discharge, as indicated in view B of the 
figure, because of its relatively long discharge time constant. The larger the value of the filter capacitor, 
the better the filtering action. However, because of physical size, there is a practical limitation to the 
maximum value of the capacitor.

The inductor (L1) and the capacitor (C1) form a voltage divider for the ac component (ripple) of the 
applied input voltage. This is shown in views A and B of figure 4-21. As far as the ripple component is 
concerned, the inductor offers a high impedance (Z) and the capacitor offers a low impedance (view B).

</p><p class="paragraph">Now look at figure 4-22 which illustrates a complete cycle of operation for a full-wave rectifier 
circuit used to supply the input voltage to the filter. The rectifier voltage is developed across the capacitor 
(C1). The ripple voltage at the output of the filter is the alternating component of the input voltage 
reduced in amplitude by the filter section. Each time the anode of a diode goes positive with respect to the 
cathode, the diode conducts and C1 charges. Conduction occurs twice during each cycle for a full-wave 
rectifier. For a 60-hertz supply, this produces a 120-hertz ripple voltage. Although the diodes alternate 
(one conducts while the other is nonconducting), the filter input voltage is not steady. As the anode 
voltage of the conducting diode increases (on the positive half of the cycle), capacitor C1 charges-the 
charge being limited by the impedance of the secondary transformer winding, the diode's forward 
(cathode-to-anode) resistance, and the counter electromotive force developed by the choke. During the 
nonconducting interval (when the anode voltage drops below the capacitor charge voltage), C1 discharges 
through the load resistor (RL). The components in the discharge path have a long time constant; thus, C1 
discharges more slowly than it charges.

</p><p class="paragraph">The choke (L1) is usually a large value, from 1 to 20 henries, and offers a large inductive reactance 
to the 120-hertz ripple component produced by the rectifier. Therefore, the effect that L1 has on the 
charging of the capacitor (C1) must be considered. Since L1 is connected in series with the parallel 
branch consisting of C1 and RL, a division of the ripple (ac) voltage and the output (dc) voltage occurs. 
The greater the impedance of the choke, the less the ripple voltage that appears across C1 and the output. 
The dc output voltage is fixed mainly by the dc resistance of the choke.

117 volts 60 hertz. Both half-wave and full-wave rectifier circuits will be used to provide the input to the

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The above calculation shows that L1 offers a relatively high opposition (3.8 kilohms) to the ripple in 
comparison to the opposition offered by C1 (265 ohms). Thus, more ripple voltage will be dropped across 
L1 than across C1. In addition, the impedance of C1 (265 ohms) is relatively low with respect to the 
resistance of the load (10 kilohms). Therefore, more ripple current flows through C1 than the load. In 
other words, C1 shunts most of the ac component around the load. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's go a step further and redraw the filter circuit so that you can see the voltage divider action. 
Refer to view A of figure 4-24. Remember, the 165 volts peak 60 hertz provided by the rectifier consists 
of both an ac and a dc component. This first discussion will be about the ac component. From the figure, 
you see that the capacitor (C1) offers the least opposition (265 ohms) to the ac component. Therefore, the 
greater amount of ac will flow through C1. (The heavy line in view B indicates the ac current flow 
through the capacitor.) Thus the capacitor bypasses, or shunts, most of the ac around the load.

(∞) impedance to the flow of direct current. The dc component, therefore, must flow through RL and L1. 
As far as the dc is concerned, the capacitor does not exist. The coil and the load are therefore in series 
with each other. The dc resistance of a filter choke is very low (50 ohms average). Consequently, most of 
the dc component is developed across the load and a very small amount of the dc voltage is dropped 
across the coil, as shown in figure 4-26.

frequency sensitive, the coil provides a large resistance to ac and a small resistance to dc. In other words, 
the coil opposes any change in current. This property makes the coil a highly desirable filter component. 
Note that the filtering action of the LC choke-input filter is improved when the filter is used in 
conjunction with a full-wave rectifier, as shown in figure 4-27. This is due to the decrease in the X C of 
the filter capacitor and the increase in the XL of the choke. Remember, ripple frequency of a full-wave

</p><p class="paragraph">The single capacitor filter is suitable for many noncritical, low-current applications. However, when 
the load resistance is very low or when the percent of ripple must be held to an absolute minimum, the 
capacitor value required must be extremely large. While electrolytic capacitors are available in sizes up to 
10,000 microfarads or greater, the large sizes are quite expensive. A more practical approach is to use a 
more sophisticated filter that can do the same job but that has lower capacitor values, such as the RC 
filter.

explanation of how a filter works will show you that an RC filter of this type does a much better job than 
the single capacitor filter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">C1 performs exactly the same function as it did in the single capacitor filter. It is used to reduce the 
percentage of ripple to a relatively low value. Thus, the voltage across C1 might consist of an average dc

stage of RC filtering can be added. In practice, the second stage is rarely required. The RC filter is 
extremely popular because smaller capacitors can be used with good results. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The RC filter has some disadvantages. First, the voltage drop across R1 takes voltage away from the 
load. Second, power is wasted in R1 and is dissipated in the form of unwanted heat. Finally, if the load 
resistance changes, the voltage across the load will change. Even so, the advantages of the RC filter 
overshadow these disadvantages in many cases.

</p><p class="paragraph">FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE RESISTOR-CAPACITOR (RC) FILTER.—The shunt 
capacitors (C1 and C2) are subject to an open circuit, a short circuit, or excessive leakage. The series filter 
resistor (R1) is subject to changes in value and occasionally opens. Any of these troubles can be easily 
detected. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The input capacitor (C1) has the greatest pulsating voltage applied to it and is the most susceptible to 
voltage surges. As a result, the input capacitor is frequently subject to voltage breakdown and shorting. 
The remaining shunt capacitor (C2) in the filter circuit is not subject to voltage surges because of the 
protection offered by the series filter resistor (R1). However, a shunt capacitor can become open, leaky, or 
shorted. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A shorted capacitor or an open filter resistor results in a no-output indication. An open filter resistor 
results in an abnormally high dc voltage at the input to the filter and no voltage at the output of the filter. 
Leaky capacitors or filter resistors that have lost their effectiveness, or filter resistors that have decreased 
in value, result in an excessive ripple amplitude in the output of the supply. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">LC Capacitor-Input Filter 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The LC capacitor-input filter is one of the most commonly used filters. This type of filter is used 
primarily in radio receivers, small audio amplifier power supplies, and in any type of power supply where 
the output current is low and the load current is relatively constant. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-29 shows an LC capacitor-input filter and associated waveforms. Both half-wave and 
full-wave rectifier circuits are used to provide the input. The waveforms shown in view A of the figure 
represent the unfiltered output from a typical rectifier circuit. Note that the average value of output 
voltage (Eavg), indicated by the dashed lines, for the half-wave rectifier is less than half the amplitude of 
the voltage peaks. The average value of output voltage (Eavg) for the full-wave rectifier is greater than 
half, but is still much less than the peak amplitude of the rectifier-output waveform. With no filter 
connected across the output of the rectifier circuit (which results in unfiltered output voltage), the 
waveform has a large value of pulsating component (ripple) as compared to the average (or dc) 
component. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">C1 reduces the ripple to a relatively low level (view B). L1 and C2 form the LC filter, which reduces 
the ripple even further. L1 is a large value iron-core induct (choke). L1 has a high value of inductance an 
therefore, a high value of XL which offers a high reactance to the ripple frequency. At the same time, C2 
offers a very low reactance to ac ripple. L1 and C2 for an ac voltage divider and, because the reactance of 
L1 much higher than that of C2, most of the ripple voltage is dropped across L1. Only a slight trace of 
ripple appears across C2 and the load (view C). 
</p><p class="paragraph">While the L1-C2 network greatly reduces ac ripple it has little effect on dc. You should recall that an 
inductor offers no reactance to dc. The only opposition to current flow is the resistance of the wire in the 
choke. Generally, this resistance is very low and the dc voltage drop across the coil is minimal. Thus, the 
LC filter overcomes the disadvantages of the RC filter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Aside from the voltage divider effect, the inductor improves filtering in another way. You should 
recall that an inductor resists changes in the magnitude of the current flowing through it. Consequently, 
when the inductor is placed in series with the load, the inductor maintains steady current. In turn, this 
helps the voltage across the load remain constant when size of components is a factor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The LC filter provides good filtering action over a wide range of currents. The capacitor filters best 
when the load is drawing little current. Thus, the capacitor discharges very slowly and the output voltage 
remains almost constant. On the other hand, the inductor filters best when the current is highest. The 
complementary nature of these two components ensures that good filtering will occur over a wide range 
of currents. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The LC filter has two disadvantages. First, it is more expensive than the RC filter because an 
iron-core choke costs more than a resistor. The second disadvantage is size. The iron-core choke is bulky 
and heavy, a fact which may render the LC filter unsuitable for many applications. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">FALURE ANALYSIS OF THE LC CAPACITOR-INPUT FILTER.—Shunt capacitors are 
subject to open circuits, short circuits, and excessive leakage; series inductors are subject to open 
windings and occasionally shorted turns or a short circuit to the core. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The input capacitor (C1) has the greatest pulsating voltage applied to it, is the most susceptible to 
voltage surges, and has a generally higher average voltage applied. As a result, the input capacitor is 
frequently subject to voltage breakdown and shorting. The output capacitor (C2) is not as susceptible to 
voltage surges because of the series protection offered by the series inductor (L1), but the capacitor can 
become open, leaky, or shorted. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A shorted capacitor, an open filter choke, or a choke winding which is shorted to the core, results in 
a no-output indication. A shorted capacitor, depending on the magnitude of the short, may cause a shorted 
rectifier, transformer, or filter choke, and may result in a blown fuse in the primary of the transformer. An 
open filter choke results in an abnormally high dc voltage at the input to the filter and no voltage at the 
output of the filter. A leaky or open capacitor in the filter circuit results in a low dc output voltage. This 
condition is generally accompanied by an excessive ripple amplitude. Shorted turns in the winding of a 
filter choke reduce the effective inductance of the choke and decrease its filtering efficiency. As a result, 
the ripple amplitude increases. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-VOLTAGE-REGULATION-4-35-">VOLTAGE REGULATION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Ideally, the output of most power supplies should be a constant voltage. Unfortunately, this is 
difficult to achieve. There are two factors that can cause the output voltage to change. First, the ac line 
voltage is not constant. The so-called 115 volts ac can vary from about 105 volts ac to 125 volts ac. This 
means that the peak ac voltage to which the rectifier responds can vary from about 148 volts to 177 volts. 
The ac line voltage alone can be responsible for nearly a 20 percent change in the dc output voltage. The 
second factor that can change the dc output voltage is a change in the load resistance. In complex 
electronic equipment, the load can change as circuits are switched in and out. In a television receiver, the 
load on a particular power supply may depend on the brightness of the screen, the control settings, or even 
the channel selected. 
</p><p class="paragraph">These variations in load resistance tend to change the applied dc voltage because the power supply 
has a fixed internal resistance. If the load resistance decreases, the internal resistance of the power supply 
drops more voltage. This causes a decrease in the voltage across the load. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Many circuits are designed to operate with a particular supply voltage. When the supply voltage 
changes, the operation of the circuit may be adversely affected. Consequently, some types of equipment 
must have power supplies that produce the same output voltage regardless of changes in the load 
resistance or changes in the ac line voltage. This constant output voltage may be achieved by adding a 
circuit called the VOLTAGE REGULATOR at the output of the filter. There are many different types of 
regulators in use today and to discuss all of them would be beyond the scope of this chapter.

</p><p class="paragraph">The schematic drawing in view A is that of a shunt-type regulator. It is called a shunt-type regulator 
because the regulating device is connected in parallel with the load resistance. The schematic drawing in 
view B is that of a series regulator. It is called a series regulator because the regulating device is 
connected in series with the load resistance. Figure 4-32 illustrates the principle of series voltage 
regulation. As you study the figure, notice that the regulator is in series with the load resistance (RL) and 
that the fixed resistor (RS) is in series with the load resistance. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">You already know the voltage drop across a fixed resistor remains constant unless the current 
flowing through it varies (increases or decreases). In a shunt regulator, as shown in figure 4-33, output 
voltage regulation is determined by the current through the parallel resistance of the regulating device 
(RV), the load resistance (RL), and the series resistor (RS). For now, assume that the circuit is operating 
under normal conditions, that the input is 120 volts dc, and that the desired regulated output is 100 volts 
dc. For a 100-volt output to be maintained, 20 volts must be dropped across the series resistor (RS). If you 
assume that the value of RS is 2 ohms, you must have 10 amperes of current through RV and R L. 
(Remember: E = IR.) If the values of the resistance of R V and RL are equal, 5 amperes of current will 
flow through each resistance (RV and RL). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, if the load resistance (RL) increases, the current through RL will decrease. For example, assume 
that the current through RL is now 4 amperes and that the total current through RS is 9 amperes. With this </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">drop in current, the voltage drop across RS is 18 volts; consequently, the output of the regulator has 
increased to 102 volts. At this time, the regulating device (RV) decreases in resistance, and 6 amperes of 
current flows through this resistance (RV). Thus, the total current RS is once again 10 amperes (6 amperes 
through RV; 4 amperes through RL). Therefore, 20 volts is dropped across RS causing the output to 
decrease back to 100 volts. You should know by now that if the load resistance (RL) increases, the 
regulating device (RV) decreases its resistance to compensate for the change. If RL decreases, the opposite 
effect occurs and RV increases. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now consider the circuit when a decrease in load resistance takes place. When RL decreases, the 
current through R L subsequently increases to 6 amperes. This action causes a total of 11 amperes to flow 
through RS which then drops 22 volts. As a result, the output is 98 volts. However, the regulating device 
(RV) senses this change and increases its resistance so that less current (4 amperes) flows through RV. The 
total current again becomes 10 amperes, and the output is again 100 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">From these examples, you should now understand that the shunt regulator maintains the desired 
output voltage first by sensing the current change in the parallel resistance of the circuit and then by 
compensating for the change. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Again refer to the schematic shown in figure 4-33 and consider how the voltage regulator operates to 
compensate for changes in input voltages. You know, of course, that the input voltage may vary and that 
any variation must be compensated for by the regulating device. If an increase in input voltage occurs, the 
resistance of R V automatically decreases to maintain the correct voltage division between RV and RS. You 
should see, therefore, that the regulator operates in the opposite way to compensate for a decrease in input 
voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">So far only voltage regulators that use variable resistors have been explained. However, this type of 
regulation has limitations. Obviously, the variable resistor cannot be adjusted rapidly enough to 
compensate for frequent fluctuations in voltages. Since input voltages fluctuate frequently and rapidly, the 
variable resistor is not a practical method for voltage regulation. A voltage regulator that operates 
continuously and automatically to regulate the output voltage without external manipulation is required 
for practical regulation.

This 0.8 volt is the difference between the Zener reference voltage of 15 volts and the momentary output

</p><p class="paragraph">Now, refer to view A of figure 4-39. This figure shows the schematic diagram of the same shunt 
voltage regulator as that shown in figure 4-38 with an increased input voltage of 20.1 volts. This increases 
the forward bias on Q1 to 0.8 volt. Recall that the voltage drop across CR1 remains constant at 5.6 volts. 
Since the output voltage is composed of the Zener voltage and the base-emitter voltage, the output voltage 
momentarily increases to 6.4 volts. At this time, the increase in the forward bias of Q1 lowers the 
resistance of the transistor allowing more current to flow through it. Since this current must also pass 
through RS, there is also an increase in the voltage drop across this resistor. The voltage drop across RS is 
now 13.8 volts and therefore the output voltage is reduced to 6.3 volts. Remember, this change takes 
place in a fraction of a second. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Study the schematic shown in view B. Although this schematic is identical to the other shunt voltage 
schematics previously illustrated and discussed, the output voltage is different. The load current has 
increased causing a momentary drop in voltage output to 6.2 volts. Recall that the circuit was designed to 
ensure a constant output voltage of 6.3 volts. Since the output voltage is less than that required, changes 
occur in the regulator to restore the output to 6.3 volts. Because of the 0.1 volt drop in the output voltage, 
the forward bias of Q1 is now 0.6 volt. This decrease in the forward bias increases the resistance of the 
transistor, thereby reducing the current flow through Q1 by the same amount that the load current 
increased. The current flow through RS returns to its normal value and restores the output voltage to 6.3 
volts.

</h3><p class="paragraph">You should now know how voltage regulators work to provide constant output voltages. In some 
circuits it may be necessary to regulate the current output. The circuitry which provides a constant current 
output is called a constant current regulator or just CURRENT REGULATOR. The schematic shown in 
figure 4-40 is a simplified schematic for a current regulator. The variable resistor shown on the schematic 
is used to illustrate the concept of current regulation. You should know from your study of voltage 
regulators that a variable resistor does not respond quickly enough to compensate for the changes. Notice 
that an ammeter has been included in this circuit to indicate that the circuit shown is that of a current 
regulator. When the circuit functions properly, the current reading of the ammeter remains constant. In 
this case the variable resistor (RV) compensates for changes in the load or dc input voltage. Adequate 
current regulation results in the loss of voltage regulation. Studying the schematic shown, you should 
recall that any increase in load resistance causes a drop in current. To maintain a constant current flow, 
the resistance of RV must be reduced whenever the load resistance increases. This causes the total 
resistance to remain constant. An increase in the input voltage must be compensated for by an increase in 
the resistance of RV, thereby maintaining a constant current flow. The operation of a current regulator is 
similar to that of a voltage regulator. The basic difference is that one regulates current and the other 
regulates voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since use of a variable resistor is not a practical way to control current fluctuation or variation, a 
transistor and a Zener diode, together with necessary resistors, are used. Recall that the Zener diode 
provides a constant reference voltage. The schematic shown in figure 4-41 is that of a current regulator 
circuit. Except for the addition of R1, the circuit shown in the figure is similar to that of a series voltage 
regulator. The resistor is connected in series with the load and senses any current changes in the load.

bias for Q1. However, since the regulated voltage across CR1 has an opposite polarity, the actual bias of 
the transistor is the difference between the two voltages. You should see that the purpose of R2 is to 
function as a current-limiting resistor for the Zener diode. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The purpose of a current regulator is to provide a constant current regardless of changes in the input 
voltage or load current. The schematic shown in figure 4-42 is that of a circuit designed to provide a 
constant current of 400 milliamperes. Voltmeters are shown in the schematic to emphasize the voltage 
drops across specific components. These voltages will help you understand how the current regulator 
operates. The voltage drop across the base-emitter junction of Q1 is 0.6 volt. This voltage is the difference 
between the Zener voltage and the voltage drop across R1. The 0.6-volt forward bias of Q1 permits 
proper operation of the transistor. The output voltage across RL is 6 volts as shown by the voltmeter. With 
a regulated current output of 400 milliamperes, the transistor resistance (RQ1) is 9 ohms. This can be 
proved by using Ohm's law and the values shown on the schematic. In this case, current (I) is equal to the 
voltage drop (E) divided by the resistance (R). Therefore: 12 volts divided by 30 ohms equals 0.4 ampere, 
or 400 milliamperes.

</p><p class="paragraph">Since you are familiar with the basic current regulating circuitry, let's examine in detail how the 
various components work to maintain the constant 400-milliampere output. Refer to the schematic shown 
in figure 4-43. Remember a decrease in load resistance causes a corresponding increase in current flow. In 
the example shown, the load resistance R L has dropped from 15 ohms to 10 ohms. This results in a larger 
voltage drop across R1 because of the increased current flow. The voltage drop has increased from 2.4 
volts to 2.5 volts. Of course, the voltage drop across CR1 remains constant at 9 volts due to its regulating 
ability. Because of the increased voltage drop across R1, the forward bias on Q1 is now 0.5 volt. Since the 
forward bias of Q1 has decreased, the resistance of the transistor increases from 9 ohms to 14 ohms. 
Notice that the 5 ohm increase in resistance across the transistor corresponds to the 5 ohm decrease in the 
load resistance. Thus, the total resistance around the outside loop of the circuit remains constant. Since 
the circuit is a current regulator, you know that output voltages will vary as the regulator maintains a 
constant current output. In the figure, the voltage output is reduced to 4 volts, which is computed by 
multiplying current (I) times resistance (R) (400 mA × 10 ohms = 4 volts).

</h2><p class="paragraph">You may already know how a transformer functions to increase or decrease voltages. You may also 
have learned that a transformer secondary may provide one or several ac voltage outputs which may be 
greater or less than the input voltage. When voltages are stepped up, current is decreased; when voltages 
are stepped down, current is increased. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Another method for increasing voltages is known as voltage multiplication. VOLTAGE 
MULTIPLIERS are used primarily to develop high voltages where low current is required. The most 
common application of the high voltage outputs of voltage multipliers is the anode of cathode-ray tubes 
(CRT), which are used for radar scope presentations, oscilloscope presentations, or TV picture tubes. The 
dc output of the voltage multiplier ranges from 1000 volts to 30,000 volts. The actual voltage depends 
upon the size of the CRT and its equipment application. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Voltage multipliers may also be used as primary power supplies where a 177 volt-ac input is 
rectified to pulsating dc. This dc output voltage may be increased (through use of a voltage multiplier) to 
as much as 1000 volts dc. This voltage is generally used as the plate or screen grid voltage for electron 
tubes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you have studied transformers, you may have learned that when voltage is stepped up, the output 
current decreases. This is also true of voltage multipliers. Although the measured output voltage of a 
voltage multiplier may be several times greater than the input voltage, once a load is connected the value 
of the output voltage decreases. Also any small fluctuation of load impedance causes a large fluctuation in 
the output voltage of the multiplier. For this reason, voltage multipliers are used only in special 
applications where the load is constant and has a high impedance or where input voltage stability is not 
critical. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Voltage multipliers may be classified as voltage doublers, triplers, or quadruplers. The classification 
depends on the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage. For example, a voltage multiplier that 
increases the peak input voltage twice is called a voltage doubler. Voltage multipliers increase voltages 
through the use of series-aiding voltage sources. This can be compared to the connection of dry cells 
(batteries) in series. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The figures used in the explanation of voltage multipliers show a transformer input, even though for 
some applications a transformer is not necessary. The input could be directly from the power source or 
line voltage. This, of course, does not isolate the equipment from the line and creates a potentially 
hazardous condition. Most military equipments use transformers to minimize this hazard. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 4-44 shows the schematic for a half-wave voltage doubler. Notice the similarities between 
this schematic and those of half-wave voltage rectifiers. In fact, the doubler shown is made up of two 
half-wave voltage rectifiers. C1 and CR1 make up one half-wave rectifier, and C2 and CR2 make up the 
other. The schematic of the first half-wave rectifier is indicated by the dark lines in view A of figure 4-45.

input cycle (view A), the polarity across the secondary winding of the transformer is as shown. Note that 
the top of the secondary is negative. At this time CR1 is forward biased (cathode negative in respect to the 
anode). This forward bias causes CR1 to function like a closed switch and allows current to follow the 
path indicated by the arrows. At this time, C1 charges to the peak value of the input voltage, or 200 volts,

dc voltage of 400 volts, as shown by the waveform. The effect of series aiding is comparable to the 
connection of two 200-volt batteries in series. As shown in figure 4-46, C2 charges to the sum of these

output ripple amplitude and an increase in the ripple frequency. The circuit is, in fact, two half-wave 
rectifiers. These rectifiers function as series-aiding devices except in a slightly different way. During the 
alternation when the secondary of the transformer is positive at the top, C1 charges to 200 volts through 
CR1. Then, when the transformer secondary is negative at the top, C2 charges to 200 volts through CR2. 
R1 and R2 are equal value, balancing resistors that stabilize the charges of the two capacitors. Resistive 
load RL is connected across C1 and C2 so that R L receives the total charge of both capacitors. The output 
voltage is +400 volts when measured at the top of R L, or point "A" with respect to point "B." If the output 
is measured at the bottom of RL, it is −400 volts. Either way, the output is twice the peak value of the ac

short develops in the load, a large amount of current will flow in the regulator circuit. The pass transistor 
can be damaged by this excessive current flow. You could place a fuse in the circuit, but in many cases, 
the transistor will be damaged before the fuse blows. The best way to protect this circuit is to limit the 
current automatically to a safe value. A series regulator with a current-limiting circuit is shown in figure 
4-50. You should recall that in order for a silicon NPN transistor to conduct, the base must be between 0.6 
volt to 0.7 volt more positive than the emitter. Resistor R4 will develop a voltage drop of 0.6 volt when 
the load current reaches 600 milliamperes. This is illustrated using Ohm's law:

above 600 to 700 milliamperes.

importance to remember. In the front of all electronic technical manuals, you will always find a section on 
safety precautions. Also posted on each piece of equipment should be a sign listing the specific 
precautions for that equipment. One area that is sometimes overlooked, and is a hazard especially on 
board ship, is the method in which equipment is grounded. By grounding the return side of the power 
transformer to the metal chassis, the load being supplied by the power supply can be wired directly to the 
metal chassis. Thereby the necessity of wiring directly to the return side of the transformer is eliminated. 
This method saves wire and reduces the cost of building the equipment, and while it solves one of the 
problems of the manufacturer, it creates a problem for you, the technician. Unless the chassis is physically 
grounded to the ship's ground (the hull), the chassis can be charged (or can float) several hundred volts 
above ship's ground. If you come in contact with the metal chassis at the same time you are in contact 
with the ship's hull, the current from the chassis can use your body as a low resistance path back to the

</p><p class="paragraph">c. LOOSE, BROKEN, OR CORRODED CONNECTION—Any connection that is not in good 
condition is a trouble spot. If it is not causing trouble now, it will probably cause problems in 
the future. Fix it. 
</p><p class="paragraph">d. DAMAGED RESISTORS OR CAPACITORS—A resistor that is discolored or charred has 
been subjected to an overload. An electrolytic capacitor will show a whitish deposit at the 
seal around the terminals. Check for a short whenever you notice a damaged resistor or a 
damaged capacitor. If there is no short, the trouble may be that the power supply has been 
overloaded in some way. Make a note to replace the part after signal tracing. There is no 
sense in risking a new part until the trouble has been located. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. ENERGIZE THE EQUIPMENT AND LOOK FOR: 
</p><p class="paragraph">a. SMOKING PARTS—If any part smokes or if you hear any boiling or sputtering sounds, 
remove the power immediately. There is a short circuit somewhere that you have missed in 
your first inspection. Use any ohmmeter to check the part once again. Start in the 
neighborhood of the smoking part. 
</p><p class="paragraph">b. SPARKING—Tap or shake the chassis. If you see or hear sparking, you have located a loose 
connection or a short. Check and repair. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you locate and repair any of the defects listed under the visual check, make a note of what you find 
and what you do to correct it. It is quite probable you have found the trouble. However, a good technician </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">takes nothing for granted. You must prove to yourself that the equipment is operating properly and that no 
other troubles exist. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If you find none of the defects listed under the visual check, go ahead with the signal tracing 
procedure. The trouble is probably of such a nature that it cannot be seen directly-it may only be seen 
using an oscilloscope. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Tracing the ac signal through the equipment is the most rapid and accurate method of locating a 
trouble that cannot be found by a visual check, and it also serves as check on any repairs you may have 
made. The idea is to trace the ac voltage from the transformer, to see it change to pulsating dc at the 
rectifier output, and then see the pulsations smoothed out by the filter. The point where the signal stops or 
becomes distorted is the place look for the trouble. If you have no dc output voltage, you should look for 
an open or a short in your signal tracing. If you have a low dc voltage, you should look for a defective 
part and keep your eyes open for the place where the signal becomes distorted. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Signal tracing is one method used to localize trouble in a circuit. This is done by observing the 
waveform at the input and output of each part of a circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's review what each part of a good power supply does to a signal, as shown in figure 4-51. The ac 
voltage is brought in from the power line by means of the line cord. This voltage is connected to the 
primary of the transformer through the ON-OFF switch (S1). At the secondary winding of the transformer 
(points 1 and 2), the scope shows you a picture of the stepped-up voltage developed across each half of 
the secondary winding-the picture is that of a complete sine wave. Each of the two stepped-up voltages is 
connected between ground and one of the two anodes of the rectifier diodes. At the two rectifier anodes 
(points 4 and 5), there is still no change in the shape of the stepped-up voltage-the scope picture still 
shows a complete sine wave. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">However, when you look at the scope pattern for point 6 (the voltage at the rectifier cathodes), you 
see the waveshape for pulsating direct current. This pulsating dc is fed through the first choke (L1) and 
filter capacitor (C1) which remove a large part of the ripple, or "hum," as shown by the waveform for 
point 7. Finally the dc voltage is fed through the second choke (L2) and filter capacitor (C2), which </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">remove nearly all of the remaining ripple. (See the waveform for point 8, which shows almost no visible 
ripple.) You now have almost pure dc. 
</p><p class="paragraph">No matter what power supplies you use in the future, they all do the same thing—they change ac 
voltage into dc voltage. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Component Problems 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The following paragraphs will give you an indication of troubles that occur with many different 
electronic circuit components. 
</p><p class="paragraph">TRANSFORMER AND CHOKE TROUBLES.—As you should know by now, the transformer 
and the choke are quite similar in construction. Likewise, the basic troubles that they may develop are 
comparable. 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. A winding can open. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Two or more turns of one winding can short together. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. A winding can short to the casing, which is usually grounded. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Two windings (primary and secondary) can short together. This trouble is possible, of course, 
only in transformers. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">When you have decided which of these four possible troubles could be causing the symptoms, you 
have definite steps to take. If you surmise that there is an open winding, or windings shorted together or 
to ground, an ohmmeter continuity check will locate the trouble. If the turns of a winding are shorted 
together, you may not be able to detect a difference in winding resistance. Therefore, you need to connect 
a good transformer in the place of the old one and see if the symptoms are eliminated. Keep in mind that 
transformers are difficult to replace. Make absolutely sure that the trouble is not elsewhere in the circuit 
before you change the transformer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Occasionally, the shorts will only appear when the operating voltages are applied to the transformer. 
In this case you might find the trouble with a megger-an instrument which applies a high voltage as it 
reads resistance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">CAPACITOR AND RESISTOR TROUBLES.—Just two things can happen to a capacitor: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. It may open up, removing the capacitor completely from the circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. It may develop an internal short circuit. This means that it begins to pass current as though it were 
a resistor or a direct short. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">You may check a capacitor suspected of being open by disconnecting it from the circuit and 
checking it with a capacitor analyzer. You can check a capacitor suspected of being leaky with an 
ohmmeter; if it reads less than 500 kilohms, it is more than likely bad. However, capacitor troubles are 
difficult to find since they may appear intermittently or only under operating voltages. Therefore, the best 
check for a faulty capacitor is to replace it with one known to be good. If this restores proper operation, 
the fault was in the capacitor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Resistor troubles are the simplest. However, like the others, they must be considered. 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. A resistor can open. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. A resistor can increase in value. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. A resistor can decrease in value. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">You already know how to check possible resistor troubles. Just use an ohmmeter after making sure 
no parallel circuit is connected across the resistor you wish to measure. When you know a parallel circuit 
is connected across the resistor or when you are in doubt disconnect one end of the resistor before 
measuring it. The ohmmeter check will usually be adequate. However, never forget that occasionally 
intermittent troubles may develop in resistors as well as in any other electronic parts.

</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY 
</h1><p class="paragraph">This chapter has presented you with a basic description of the theory and operation of a basic power 
supply and its components. The following summary is provided to enhance your understanding of power 
supplies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">POWER SUPPLIES are electronic circuits designed to convert ac to dc at any desired level. Almost 
all power supplies are composed of four sections: transformer, rectifier, filter, and regulator. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The POWER TRANSFORMER is the input transformer for the power supply. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The RECTIFIER is the section of the power supply that contains the secondary windings of the 
power transformer and the rectifier circuit. The rectifier uses the ability of a diode to conduct during one 
half cycle of ac to convert ac to dc. 
</p><p class="paragraph">HALF-WAVE RECTIFIERS give an output on only one half cycle of the input ac. For this reason, 
the pulses of dc are separated by a period of one half cycle of zero potential voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">FULL-WAVE RECTIFIERS conduct on both halves of the input ac cycles. As a result, the dc 
pulses are not separated from each other. A characteristic of full-wave rectifiers is the use of a </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">center-tapped, high-voltage secondary. Because of the center tap, the output of the rectifier is limited to 
one-half of the input voltage of the high-voltage secondary. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">BRIDGE RECTIFIERS are full-wave rectifiers that do not use a center-tapped, high-voltage 
secondary. Because of this, their dc output voltage is equal to the input voltage from the high-voltage 
secondary of the power transformer. Bridge rectifiers use four diodes connected in a bridge network. 
Diodes conduct in diagonal pairs to give a full-wave pulsating dc output. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">FILTER CIRCUITS are designed to smooth, or filter, the ripple voltage present on the pulsating dc 
output of the rectifier. This is done by an electrical device that has the ability to store energy and to 
release the stored energy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">CAPACITANCE FILTERS are nothing more than large capacitors placed across the output of the 
rectifier section. Because of the large size of the capacitors, fast charge paths, and slow discharge paths, 
the capacitor will charge to average value, which will keep the pulsating dc output from reaching zero 
volts. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">INDUCTOR FILTERS use an inductor called a choke to filter the pulsating dc input. Because of 
the impedance offered to circuit current, the output of the filter is at a lower amplitude than the input. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">PI-TYPE FILTERS use both capacitive and inductive filters connected in a pi-type configuration. 
By combining filtering devices, the ability of the pi filter to remove ripple voltage is superior to that of 
either the capacitance or inductance filter. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">VOLTAGE REGULATORS are circuits designed to maintain the output of power supplies at a 
constant amplitude despite variations of the ac source voltage or changes of the resistance of the load. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">This is done by creating a voltage divider of a resistive element in the regulator and the resistance of the 
load. Regulation is achieved by varying the resistance of the resistive element in the regulator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A SERIES REGULATOR uses a variable resistance in series with the load. Regulation is achieved 
by varying this resistance either to increase or to decrease the voltage drop across the resistive element of 
the regulator. Characteristically, the resistance of the variable resistance moves in the same direction as 
the load. When the resistance of the load increases, the variable resistance of the regulator increases; 
when load resistance decreases, the variable resistance of the regulator decreases. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">SHUNT REGULATORS use a variable resistance placed in parallel with the load. Regulation is 
achieved by keeping the resistance of the load constant. Characteristically the resistance of the shunt 
moves in the opposite direction of the resistance of the load. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The CURRENT LIMITER is a short-circuit protection device that automatically limits the current 
to a safe value. This is done when the current-limiting transistor senses an increase in load current. At this 
time the current-limiting transistor decreases the voltage on the base of the pass transistor in the regulator, 
causing a decrease in its conduction. Therefore, current cannot rise above a safe value. 
</p><p class="paragraph">TROUBLESHOOTING is a method of detecting and repairing problems in electronic equipment. 
Two methods commonly used are the VISUAL CHECK and SIGNAL TRACING. The visual check 
allows the technician to make a quick check of component problems, such as shorts, discolored or leaky 
transformers, loose or broken connections, damaged resistors or capacitors, smoking parts, or sparking. 
The signal tracing method is used when the technician cannot readily see the problem and needs to use 
test equipment. Component failure is also important in troubleshooting. In transformers and chokes, a 
winding can open, or two or more windings can short, either to themselves or to the case that is usually 
grounded. In a capacitor only two things can occur: either it can short and act as a resistor, or it can open, 
removing it from the circuit. A resistor can open, increase in value, or decrease in value. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
