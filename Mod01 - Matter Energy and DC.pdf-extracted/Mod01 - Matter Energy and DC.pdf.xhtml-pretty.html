SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current

</h2><p class="paragraph">The origin of the modern technical and electronic Navy stretches back to the beginning of naval
history, when the first navies were no more than small fleets of wooden ships, using wind-filled sails and
manned oars. The need for technicians then was restricted to a navigator and semiskilled seamen who
could handle the sails.
</p><p class="paragraph">As time passed, larger ships that carried more sail were built. These ships, encouraging exploration
and commerce, helped to establish world trade routes. Soon strong navies were needed to guard these sea
lanes. Countries established their own navies to protect their citizens, commercial ships, and shipping
lanes against pirates and warring nations. With the addition of mounted armament, gunners joined the
ship’s company of skilled or semiskilled technicians.
</p><p class="paragraph">The advent of the steam engine signaled the rise of an energy source more practical than either wind
and sails or manpower. With this technological advancement, the need for competent operators and
technicians increased.
</p><p class="paragraph">However, the big call for operators and technicians in the U.S. Navy came in the early part of the
20th century, when power sources, means of communication, modes of detection, and armaments moved
with amazing rapidity toward involved technical development. Electric motors and generators by then had
become the most widely used sources of power. Telephone systems were well established on board ship,
and radio was being used more and more to relay messages from ship to ship and from ship to shore.
Listening devices were employed to detect submarines. Complex optical systems were used to aim large
naval rifles. Mines and torpedoes became highly developed, effective weapons, and airplanes joined the
Navy team.
</p><p class="paragraph">During the years after World War I, the Navy became more electricity and electronic minded. It was
recognized that a better system of communications was needed aboard each ship, and between the ships,
planes, submarines, and shore installations; and that weaponry advances were needed to keep pace with
worldwide developments in that field. This growing technology carried with it the awareness that an
equally skilled force of technicians was needed for maintenance and service duties.
</p><p class="paragraph">World War II proved that all of the expense of providing equipment for the fleet and of training
personnel to handle that equipment paid great dividends. The U. S. Navy had the modern equipment and
highly trained personnel needed to defeat the powerful fleets of the enemy.
</p><p class="paragraph">Today there is scarcely anyone on board a Navy ship who does not use electrical or electronic
equipment. This equipment is needed in systems of electric lighting and power, intercommunications,
radio, radar, sonar, loran, remote metering, weapon aiming, and certain types of mines and torpedoes. The
Navy needs trained operators and technicians in this challenging field of electronics and electricity. It is to
achieve this end that this module, and others like it, are published.

</h3><p class="paragraph">If there are roots to western science, they no doubt lie under the rubble that was once ancient Greece.
With the exception of the Greeks, ancient people had little interest in the structure of materials. They
accepted a solid as being just that a continuous, uninterrupted substance. One Greek school of thought
believed that if a piece of matter, such as copper, were subdivided, it could be done indefinitely and still
only that material would be found. Others reasoned that there must be a limit to the number of
subdivisions that could be made and have the material still retain its original characteristics. They held
fast to the idea that there must be a basic particle upon which all substances are built. Recent experiments
have revealed that there are, indeed, several basic particles, or building blocks within all substances.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The following paragraphs explain how substances are classified as elements and compounds, and are
made up of molecules and atoms. This, then, will be a learning experience about protons, electrons,
valence, energy levels, and the physics of electricity.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MATTER-1-3-">MATTER
</h2><p class="paragraph">Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and has weight; that is, the weight and dimensions
of matter can be measured. Examples of matter are air, water, automobiles, clothing, and even our own
bodies. Thus, we can say that matter may be found in any one of three states: SOLID, LIQUID, and
GASEOUS.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELEMENTS-AND-COMPOUNDS-1-3-">ELEMENTS AND COMPOUNDS
</h2><p class="paragraph">An ELEMENT is a substance which cannot be reduced to a simpler substance by chemical means.
Examples of elements with which you are in everyday contact are iron, gold, silver, copper, and oxygen.
There are now over 100 known elements. All the different substances we know about are composed of
one or more of these elements.
</p><p class="paragraph">When two or more elements are chemically combined, the resulting substance is called a
COMPOUND. A compound is a chemical combination of elements which can be separated by chemical
but not by physical means. Examples of common compounds are water which consists of hydrogen and
oxygen, and table salt, which consists of sodium and chlorine. A MIXTURE, on the other hand, is a
combination of elements and compounds, not chemically combined, that can be separated by physical
means. Examples of mixtures are air, which is made up of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and small
amounts of several rare gases, and sea water, which consists chiefly of salt and water.
</p><p class="question"> Q1. What is matter, and in what three states is it found?
 Q2. What is an element?
 Q3. What is a compound?
 Q4. What is the difference between a compound and a mixture?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-MOLECULES-1-3-">MOLECULES
</h2><p class="paragraph">A MOLECULE is a chemical combination of two or more atoms, (atoms are described in the next
paragraph). In a compound the molecule is the smallest particle that has all the characteristics of the
compound.
</p><p class="paragraph">Consider water, for example. Water is matter, since it occupies space and has weight. Depending on
the temperature, it may exist as a liquid (water), a solid (ice), or a gas (steam). Regardless of the
temperature, it will still have the same composition. If we start with a quantity of water, divide this and
pour out one half, and continue this process a sufficient number of times, we will eventually end up with a
quantity of water which cannot be further divided without ceasing to be water. This quantity is called a
molecule of water. If this molecule of water divided, instead of two parts of water, there will be one part
of oxygen and two parts of hydrogen (H
</p><p class="paragraph"> 2O).
ATOMS

element that retains the characteristics of that element. The atoms of one element, however, differ from</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

different atoms, or a different atom for each element. Just as thousands of words can be made by
combining the proper letters of the alphabet, so thousands of different materials can be made by
chemically combining the proper atoms.
</p><p class="paragraph">Any particle that is a chemical combination of two or more atoms is called a molecule. The oxygen
molecule consists of two atoms of oxygen, and the hydrogen molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen.
Sugar, on the other hand, is a compound composed of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These
atoms are combined into sugar molecules. Since the sugar molecules can be broken down by chemical
means into smaller and simpler units, we cannot have sugar atoms.
</p><p class="paragraph">The atoms of each element are made up of electrons, protons, and, in most cases, neutrons, which are
collectively called subatomic particles. Furthermore, the electrons, protons, and neutrons of one element
are identical to those of any other element. The reason that there are different kinds of elements is that the
number and the arrangement of electrons and protons within the atom are different for the different
elements
</p><p class="paragraph">The electron is considered to be a small negative charge of electricity. The proton has a positive
charge of electricity equal and opposite to the charge of the electron. Scientists have measured the mass
and size of the electron and proton, and they know how much charge each possesses. The electron and
proton each have the same quantity of charge, although the mass of the proton is approximately 1837
times that of the electron. In some atoms there exists a neutral particle called a neutron. The neutron has a
mass approximately equal to that of a proton, but it has no electrical charge. According to a popular
theory, the electrons, protons, and neutrons of the atoms are thought to be arranged in a manner similar to
a miniature solar system. The protons and neutrons form a heavy nucleus with a positive charge, around
which the very light electrons revolve.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 1-1 shows one hydrogen and one helium atom. Each has a relatively simple structure. The
hydrogen atom has only one proton in the nucleus with one electron rotating about it. The helium atom is
a little more complex. It has a nucleus made up of two protons and two neutrons, with two electrons
rotating about the nucleus. Elements are classified numerically according to the complexity of their
atoms. The atomic number of an atom is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus.
</p><p class="paragraph">In a neutral state, an atom contains an equal number of protons and electrons. Therefore, an atom of
hydrogen—which contains one proton and one electron—has an atomic number of 1; and helium, with</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

with the number of protons and electrons.
</p><p class="question"> Q5. What is a molecule?
 Q6. What are the three types of subatomic particles, and what are their charges?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Energy Levels
</h3><p class="paragraph">Since an electron in an atom has both mass and motion, it contains two types of energy. By virtue of
its motion the electron contains KINETIC ENERGY. Due to its position it also contains POTENTIAL
ENERGY. The total energy contained by an electron (kinetic plus potential) is the factor which
determines the radius of the electron orbit. In order for an electron to remain in this orbit, it must neither
GAIN nor LOSE energy.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is well known that light is a form of energy, but the physical form in which this energy exists is not
known.
</p><p class="paragraph">One accepted theory proposes the existence of light as tiny packets of energy called PHOTONS.
Photons can contain various quantities of energy. The amount depends upon the color of the light
involved. Should a photon of sufficient energy collide with an orbital electron, the electron will absorb the
photon’s energy, as shown in figure 1-2. The electron, which now has a greater than normal amount of
energy, will jump to a new orbit farther from the nucleus. The first new orbit to which the electron can
jump has a radius four times as large as the radius of the original orbit. Had the electron received a greater
amount of energy, the next possible orbit to which it could jump would have a radius nine times the
original. Thus, each orbit may be considered to represent one of a large number of energy levels that the
electron may attain. It must be emphasized that the electron cannot jump to just any orbit. The electron
will remain in its lowest orbit until a sufficient amount of energy is available, at which time the electron
will accept the energy and jump to one of a series of permissible orbits. An electron cannot exist in the
space between energy levels. This indicates that the electron will not accept a photon of energy unless it
contains enough energy to elevate itself to one of the higher energy levels. Heat energy and collisions
with other particles can also cause the electron to jump orbits.

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-6
</p><p class="paragraph">Once the electron has been elevated to an energy level higher than the lowest possible energy level,
the atom is said to be in an excited state. The electron will not remain in this excited condition for more
than a fraction of a second before it will radiate the excess energy and return to a lower energy orbit. To
illustrate this principle, assume that a normal electron has just received a photon of energy sufficient to
raise it from the first to the third energy level. In a short period of time the electron may jump back to the
first level emitting a new photon identical to the one it received.
</p><p class="paragraph">A second alternative would be for the electron to return to the lower level in two jumps; from the
third to the second, and then from the second to the first. In this case the electron would emit two photons,
one for each jump. Each of these photons would have less energy than the original photon which excited
the electron.
</p><p class="paragraph">This principle is used in the fluorescent light where ultraviolet light photons, which are not visible to
the human eye, bombard a phosphor coating on the inside of a glass tube. The phosphor electrons, in
returning to their normal orbits, emit photons of light that are visible. By using the proper chemicals for
the phosphor coating, any color of light may be obtained, including white. This same principle is also
used in lighting up the screen of a television picture tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">The basic principles just developed apply equally well to the atoms of more complex elements. In
atoms containing two or more electrons, the electrons interact with each other and the exact path of any
one electron is very difficult to predict. However, each electron lies in a specific energy band and the
orbits will be considered as an average of the electron’s position.
</p><p class="question"> Q7. What is energy of motion called?
 Q8. How is invisible light changed to visible light in a fluorescent light?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Shells and Subshells
</h3><p class="paragraph">The difference between the atoms, insofar as their chemical activity and stability are concerned, is
dependent upon the number and position of the electrons included within the atom. How are these
electrons positioned within the atom? In general, the electrons reside in groups of orbits called shells.
These shells are elliptically shaped and are assumed to be located at fixed intervals. Thus, the shells are
arranged in steps that correspond to fixed energy levels. The shells, and the number of electrons required
to fill them, may be predicted by the employment of Pauli’s exclusion principle. Simply stated, this
principle specifies that each shell will contain a maximum of 2n2electrons, where n corresponds to the
shell number starting with the one closest to the nucleus. By this principle, the second shell, for example,
would contain 2(2) 2 or 8 electrons when full.
</p><p class="paragraph">In addition to being numbered, the shells are also given letter designations, as pictured in figure 1-3.
Starting with the shell closest to the nucleus and progressing outward, the shells are labeled K, L, M, N,
O, P, and Q, respectively. The shells are considered to be full, or complete, when they contain the
following quantities of electrons: two in the K shell, eight in the L shell, 18 in the M shell, and so on, in
accordance with the exclusion principle. Each of these shells is a major shell and can be divided into
subshells, of which there are four, labeled s, p, d, and f. Like the major shells, the subshells are also
limited as to the number of electrons which they can contain. Thus, the "s" subshell is complete when it
contains two electrons, the "p" subshell when it contains 10, and the "f" subshell when it contains 14
electrons.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Inasmuch as the K shell can contain no more than two electrons, it must have only one subshell, the s
subshell. The M shell is composed of three subshells: s, p, and d. If the electrons in the s, p, and d
subshells are added, their total is found to be 18, the exact number required to fill the M shell. Notice the
electron configuration for copper illustrated in figure 1-4. The copper atom contains 29 electrons, which
completely fill the first three shells and subshells, leaving one electron in the "s" subshell of the N shell.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Valence
</h3><p class="paragraph">The number of electrons in the outermost shell determines the valence of an atom. For this reason,
the outer shell of an atom is called the VALENCE SHELL; and the electrons contained in this shell are
called VALENCE ELECTRONS. The valence of an atom determines its ability to gain or lose an
electron, which in turn determines the chemical and electrical properties of the atom. An atom that is</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">lacking only one or two electrons from its outer shell will easily gain electrons to complete its shell, but a
large amount of energy is required to free any of its electrons. An atom having a relatively small number
of electrons in its outer shell in comparison to the number of electrons required to fill the shell will easily
lose these valence electrons. The valence shell always refers to the outermost shell.
</p><p class="question"> Q9. What determines the valence of an atom?
Ionization
</p><p class="paragraph">When the atom loses electrons or gains electrons in this process of electron exchange, it is said to be
IONIZED. For ionization to take place, there must be a transfer of energy which results in a change in the
internal energy of the atom. An atom having more than its normal amount of electrons acquires a negative
charge, and is called a NEGATIVE ION. The atom that gives up some of its normal electrons is left with
less negative charges than positive charges and is called a POSITIVE ION. Thus, ionization is the process
by which an atom loses or gains electrons.
</p><p class="question"> Q10. What is an ion?
</p><h3 class="subsection">CONDUCTORS, SEMICONDUCTORS, AND INSULATORS
</h3><p class="paragraph">In this study of electricity and electronics, the association of matter and electricity is important. Since
every electronic device is constructed of parts made from ordinary matter, the effects of electricity on
matter must be well understood. As a means of accomplishing this, all elements of which matter is made
may be placed into one of three categories: CONDUCTORS, SEMICONDUCTORS, and
INSULATORS, depending on their ability to conduct an electric current. CONDUCTORS are elements
which conduct electricity very readily, INSULATORS have an extremely high resistance to the flow of
electricity. All matter between these two extremes may be called SEMICONDUCTORS.
</p><p class="paragraph">The electron theory states that all matter is composed of atoms and the atoms are composed of
smaller particles called protons, electrons, and neutrons. The electrons orbit the nucleus which contains
the protons and neutrons. It is the valence electrons that we are most concerned with in electricity. These
are the electrons which are easiest to break loose from their parent atom. Normally, conductors have three
or less valence electrons; insulators have five or more valence electrons; and semiconductors  usually
have four valence electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">The electrical conductivity of matter is dependent upon the atomic structure of the material from
which the conductor is made. In any solid material, such as copper, the atoms which make up the
molecular structure are bound firmly together. At room temperature, copper will contain a considerable
amount of heat energy. Since heat energy is one method of removing electrons from their orbits, copper
will contain many free electrons that can move from atom to atom. When not under the influence of an
external force, these electrons move in a haphazard manner within the conductor. This movement is equal
in all directions so that electrons are not lost or gained by any part of the conductor. When controlled by
an external force, the electrons move generally in the same direction. The effect of this movement is felt
almost instantly from one end of the conductor to the other. This electron movement is called an
ELECTRIC CURRENT.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some metals are better conductors of electricity than others. Silver, copper, gold, and aluminum are
materials with many free electrons and make good conductors. Silver is the best conductor, followed by
copper, gold, and aluminum. Copper is used more often than silver because of cost. Aluminum is used
where weight is a major consideration, such as in high-tension power lines, with long spans between
supports. Gold is used where oxidation or corrosion is a consideration and a good conductivity is</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">required. The ability of a conductor to handle current also depends upon its physical dimensions.
Conductors are usually found in the form of wire, but may be in the form of bars, tubes, or sheets.
</p><p class="paragraph">Nonconductors have few free electrons. These materials are called INSULATORS. Some examples
of these materials are rubber, plastic, enamel, glass, dry wood, and mica. Just as there is no perfect
conductor, neither is there a perfect insulator.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some materials are neither good conductors nor good insulators, since their electrical characteristics
fall between those of conductors and insulators. These in-between materials are classified as
SEMICONDUCTORS. Germanium and silicon are two common semiconductors used in solid-state
devices.
</p><p class="question"> Q11. What determines whether a substance is a conductor or an insulator?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTROSTATICS-1-9-">ELECTROSTATICS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Electrostatics (electricity at rest) is a subject with which most persons entering the field of electricity
and electronics are somewhat familiar. For example, the way a person’s hair stands on end after a
vigorous rubbing is an effect of electrostatics. While pursuing the study of electrostatics, you will gain a
better understanding of this common occurrence. Of even greater significance, the study of electrostatics
will provide you with the opportunity to gain important background knowledge and to develop concepts
which are essential to the understanding of electricity and electronics.
</p><p class="paragraph">Interest in the subject of static electricity can be traced back to the Greeks. Thales of Miletus, a
Greek philosopher and mathematician, discovered that when an amber rod is rubbed with fur, the rod has
the amazing characteristic of attracting some very light objects such as bits of paper and shavings of
wood.
</p><p class="paragraph">About 1600, William Gilbert, an English scientist, made a study of other substances which had been
found to possess qualities of attraction similar to amber. Among these were glass, when rubbed with silk,
and ebonite, when rubbed with fur. Gilbert classified all the substances which possessed properties similar
to those of amber as electrics, a word of Greek origin meaning amber.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of Gilbert’s work with electrics, a substance such as amber or glass when given a vigorous
rubbing was recognized as being ELECTRIFIED, or CHARGED with electricity.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the year 1733, Charles Dufay, a French scientist, made an important discovery about
electrification. He found that when a glass was rubbed with fur, both the glass rod and the fur became
electrified. This realization came when he systematically placed the glass rod and the fur near other
electrified substances and found that certain substances which were attracted to the glass rod were
repelled by the fur, and vice versa. From experiments such as this, he concluded that there must be two
exactly opposite kinds of electricity.
</p><p class="paragraph">Benjamin Franklin, American statesman, inventor, and philosopher, is credited with first using the
terms POSITIVE and NEGATIVE to describe the two opposite kinds of electricity. The charge produced
on a glass rod when it is rubbed with silk, Franklin labeled positive. He attached the term negative to the
charge produced on the silk. Those bodies which were not electrified or charged, he called NEUTRAL.

the neutrally charged body should it come in contact with other neutral bodies. If, however, any number
of electrons are removed from the atoms of a body of matter, there will remain more protons than
electrons and the whole body of matter will become ELECTRICALLY POSITIVE. Should the positively
charged body come in contact with another body having a normal charge, or having a NEGATIVE (too
many electrons) charge, an electric current will flow between them. Electrons will leave the more
negative body and enter the positive body. This electron flow will continue until both bodies have equal
charges. When two bodies of matter have unequal charges and are near one another, an electric force is
exerted between them because of their unequal charges. However, since they are not in contact, their
charges cannot equalize. The existence of such an electric force, where current cannot flow, is referred to
as static electricity. ("Static" in this instance means "not moving.") It is also referred to as an electrostatic
force.
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the easiest ways to create a static charge is by friction. When two pieces of matter are rubbed
together, electrons can be "wiped off" one material onto the other. If the materials used are good
conductors, it is quite difficult to obtain a detectable charge on either, since equalizing currents can flow
easily between the conducting materials. These currents equalize the charges almost as fast as they are
created. A static charge is more easily created between nonconducting materials. When a hard rubber rod
is rubbed with fur, the rod will accumulate electrons given up by the fur, as shown in figure 1-5. Since
both materials are poor conductors, very little equalizing current can flow, and an electrostatic charge
builds up. When the charge becomes great enough, current will flow regardless of the poor conductivity
of the materials. These currents will cause visible sparks and produce a crackling sound.

</p><p class="paragraph">An atom becomes a positive ion whenever it loses an electron, and has an overall positive charge.
Conversely, whenever an atom acquires an extra electron, it becomes a negative ion and has a negative
charge.
</p><p class="paragraph">Due to normal molecular activity, there are always ions present in any material. If the number of
positive ions and negative ions is equal, the material is electrically neutral. When the number of positive
ions exceeds the number of negative ions, the material is positively charged. The material is negatively
charged whenever the negative ions outnumber the positive ions.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since ions are actually atoms without their normal number of electrons, it is the excess or the lack of
electrons in a substance that determines its charge. In most solids, the transfer of charges is by movement
of electrons rather than ions. The transfer of charges by ions will become more significant when we
consider electrical activity in liquids and gases. At this time, we will discuss electrical behavior in terms
of electron movement.
</p><p class="question"> Q14. What is the electrical charge of an atom which contains 8 protons and 11 electrons?
Charged Bodies
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the fundamental laws of electricity is that LIKE CHARGES REPEL EACH OTHER and
UNLIKE CHARGES ATTRACT EACH OTHER. A positive charge and negative charge, being unlike,
tend to move toward each other. In the atom, the negative electrons are drawn toward the positive protons
in the nucleus. This attractive force is balanced by the electron’s centrifugal force caused by its rotation
about the nucleus. As a result, the electrons remain in orbit and are not drawn into the nucleus. Electrons
repel each other because of their like negative charges, and protons repel each other because of their like
positive charges.
</p><p class="paragraph">The law of charged bodies may be demonstrated by a simple experiment. Two pith (paper pulp) balls
are suspended near one another by threads, as shown in figure 1-6.

</p><p class="paragraph">If a hard rubber rod is rubbed with fur to give it a negative charge and is then held against the right-
hand ball in part (A), the rod will give off a negative charge to the ball. The right-hand ball will have a
negative charge with respect to the left-hand ball. When released, the two balls will be drawn together, as
shown in figure 1-6(A). They will touch and remain in contact until the left-hand ball gains a portion of
the negative charge of the right-hand ball, at which time they will swing apart as shown in figure 1-6(C).
If a positive or a negative charge is placed on both balls (fig. 1-6(B)), the balls will repel each other.
Coulomb’s Law of Charges
</p><p class="paragraph">The relationship between attracting or repelling charged bodies was first discovered and written
about by a French scientist named Charles A. Coulomb. Coulomb’s Law states that CHARGED BODIES
ATTRACT OR REPEL EACH OTHER WITH A FORCE THAT IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO
THE PRODUCT OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL CHARGES, AND IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO
THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM.
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of attracting or repelling force which acts between two electrically charged bodies in
free space depends on two things—(1) their charges and (2) the distance between them.
Electric Fields
</p><p class="paragraph">The space between and around charged bodies in which their influence is felt is called an
ELECTRIC FIELD OF FORCE. It can exist in air, glass, paper, or a vacuum. ELECTROSTATIC
FIELDS and DIELECTRIC FIELDS are other names used to refer to this region of force.

ELECTROSTATIC LINES OF FORCE. These lines are imaginary and are used merely to represent the
direction and strength of the field. To avoid confusion, the lines of force exerted by a positive charge are
always shown leaving the charge, and for a negative charge they are shown entering. Figure 1-7 illustrates
the use of lines to represent the field about charged bodies.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

MAGNETIC MATERIALS
</p><p class="paragraph">Magnetism is generally defined as that property of a material which enables it to attract pieces of
iron. A material possessing this property is known as a MAGNET. The word originated with the ancient
Greeks, who found stones possessing this characteristic. Materials that are attracted by a magnet, such as
iron, steel, nickel, and cobalt, have the ability to become magnetized. These are called magnetic materials.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="question"> Q19. What are magnetic materials?
Ferromagnetic Materials
</p><p class="paragraph">The most important group of materials connected with electricity and electronics are the
ferromagnetic materials. Ferromagnetic materials are those which are relatively easy to magnetize, such
as iron, steel, cobalt, and the alloys Alnico and Permalloy. (An alloy is made from combining two or
more elements, one of which must be a metal). These new alloys can be very strongly magnetized, and
are capable of obtaining a magnetic strength great enough to lift 500 times their own weight.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Natural Magnets
</h3><p class="paragraph">Magnetic stones such as those found by the ancient Greeks are considered to be NATURAL
MAGNETS. These stones had the ability to attract small pieces of iron in a manner similar to the magnets
which are common today. However, the magnetic properties attributed to the stones were products of
nature and not the result of the efforts of man. The Greeks called these substances magnetite.
</p><p class="paragraph">The Chinese are said to have been aware of some of the effects of magnetism as early as 2600 B.C.
They observed that stones similar to magnetite, when freely suspended, had a tendency to assume a nearly
north and south direction. Because of the directional quality of these stones, they were later referred to as
lodestones or leading stones.
</p><p class="paragraph">Natural magnets, which presently can be found in the United States, Norway, and Sweden, no longer
have any practical use, for it is now possible to easily produce more powerful magnets.
</p><p class="question"> Q20. What characteristics do all ferromagnetic materials have in common?
Artificial Magnets
</p><p class="paragraph">Magnets produced from magnetic materials are called ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS. They can be made
in a variety of shapes and sizes and are used extensively in electrical apparatus. Artificial magnets are
generally made from special iron or steel alloys which are usually magnetized electrically. The material to
be magnetized is inserted into a coil of insulated wire and a heavy flow of electrons is passed through the
wire. Magnets can also be produced by stroking a magnetic material with magnetite or with another
artificial magnet. The forces causing magnetization are represented by magnetic lines of force, very
similar in nature to electrostatic lines of force.
</p><p class="paragraph">Artificial magnets are usually classified as PERMANENT or TEMPORARY, depending on their
ability to retain their magnetic properties after the magnetizing force has been removed. Magnets made
from substances, such as hardened steel and certain alloys which retain a great deal of their magnetism,
are called PERMANENT MAGNETS. These materials are relatively difficult to magnetize because of the
opposition offered to the magnetic lines of force as the lines of force try to distribute themselves
throughout the material. The opposition that a material offers to the magnetic lines of force is called
RELUCTANCE. All permanent magnets are produced from materials having a high reluctance.
</p><p class="paragraph">A material with a low reluctance, such as soft iron or annealed silicon steel, is relatively easy to
magnetize but will retain only a small part of its magnetism once the magnetizing force is removed.
Materials of this type that easily lose most of their magnetic strength are called TEMPORARY
MAGNETS. The amount of magnetism which remains in a temporary magnet is referred to as its</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">The magnetic force surrounding a magnet is not uniform. There exists a great concentration of force
at each end of the magnet and a very weak force at the center. Proof of this fact can be obtained by
dipping a magnet into iron filings (fig. 1-8). It is found that many filings will cling to the ends of the
magnet while very few adhere to the center. The two ends, which are the regions of concentrated lines of
force, are called the POLES of the magnet. Magnets have two magnetic poles and both poles have equal
magnetic strength.

simply the NORTH POLE. The other pole of the magnet is the south-seeking pole or the SOUTH POLE.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

magnet have opposite magnetic polarity.
</p><p class="paragraph">The law previously stated regarding the attraction and repulsion of charged bodies may also be
applied to magnetism if the pole is considered as a charge. The north pole of a magnet will always be
attracted to the south pole of another magnet and will show a repulsion to a north pole. The law for
magnetic poles is:
</p><p class="paragraph">Like poles repel, unlike poles attract.
</p><p class="question"> Q23. How does the law of magnetic poles relate to the law of electric charges?
The Earth’s Magnetic Poles
</p><p class="paragraph">The fact that a compass needle always aligns itself in a particular direction, regardless of its location
on earth, indicates that the earth is a huge natural magnet. The distribution of the magnetic force about the
earth is the same as that which might be produced by a giant bar magnet running through the center of the
earth (fig. 1-10). The magnetic axis of the earth is located about 15º��IURP�LWV�JHRJUDSKLFDO�D[LV�WKHUHE\
locating the magnetic poles some distance from the geographical poles. The ability of the north pole of
the compass needle to point toward the north geographical pole is due to the presence of the magnetic
pole nearby. This magnetic pole is named the magnetic North Pole. However, in actuality, it must have
the polarity of a south magnetic pole since it attracts the north pole of a compass needle. The reason for
this conflict in terminology can be traced to the early users of the compass. Knowing little about magnetic
effects, they called the end of the compass needle that pointed towards the north geographical pole, the
north pole of a compass. With our present knowledge of magnetism, we know the north pole of a compass
needle (a small bar magnet) can be attracted only by an unlike magnetic pole, that is, a pole of south
magnetic polarity.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

THEORIES OF MAGNETISM
</p><h3 class="subsection">Weber’s Theory
</h3><p class="paragraph">A popular theory of magnetism considers the molecular alignment of the material. This is known as
Weber’s theory. This theory assumes that all magnetic substances are composed of tiny molecular
magnets. Any unmagnetized material has the magnetic forces of its molecular magnets neutralized by
adjacent molecular magnets, thereby eliminating any magnetic effect. A magnetized material will have
most of its molecular magnets lined up so that the north pole of each molecule points in one direction, and
the south pole faces the opposite direction. A material with its molecules thus aligned will then have one
effective north pole, and one effective south pole. An illustration of Weber’s Theory is shown in figure 1-
11, where a steel bar is magnetized by stroking. When a steel bar is stroked several times in the same
direction by a magnet, the magnetic force from the north pole of the magnet causes the molecules to align
themselves.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">A more modern theory of magnetism is based on the electron spin principle. From the study of
atomic structure it is known that all matter is composed of vast quantities of atoms, each atom containing
one or more orbital electrons. The electrons are considered to orbit in various shells and subshells
depending upon their distance from the nucleus. The structure of the atom has previously been compared
to the solar system, wherein the electrons orbiting the nucleus correspond to the planets orbiting the sun.
Along with its orbital motion about the sun, each planet also revolves on its axis. It is believed that the
electron also revolves on its axis as it orbits the nucleus of an atom.
</p><p class="paragraph">It has been experimentally proven that an electron has a magnetic field about it along with an electric
field. The effectiveness of the magnetic field of an atom is determined by the number of electrons
spinning in each direction. If an atom has equal numbers of electrons spinning in opposite directions, the
magnetic fields surrounding the electrons cancel one another, and the atom is unmagnetized. However, if
more electrons spin in one direction than another, the atom is magnetized. An atom with an atomic
number of 26, such as iron, has 26 protons in the nucleus and 26 revolving electrons orbiting its nucleus.
If 13 electrons are spinning in a clockwise direction and 13 electrons are spinning in a counterclockwise
direction, the opposing magnetic fields will be neutralized. When more than 13 electrons spin in either
direction, the atom is magnetized. An example of a magnetized atom of iron is shown in figure 1-12.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

piece of glass is placed over a bar magnet and the iron filings are then sprinkled on the surface of the
glass. The magnetizing force of the magnet will be felt through the glass and each iron filing becomes a
temporary magnet. If the glass is now tapped gently, the iron particles will align themselves with the
magnetic field surrounding the magnet just as the compass needle did previously. The filings form a
definite pattern, which is a visible representation of the forces comprising the magnetic field. Examination
of the arrangements of iron filings in figure 1-13 will indicate that the magnetic field is very strong at the
poles and weakens as the distance from the poles increases. It is also apparent that the magnetic field
extends from one pole to the other, constituting a loop about the magnet.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

in the area surrounding a magnet (refer to fig. 1-14). These lines, called MAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE,
do not actually exist but are imaginary lines used to illustrate and describe the pattern of the magnetic
field. The magnetic lines of force are assumed to emanate from the north pole of a magnet, pass through
surrounding space, and enter the south pole. The lines of force then travel inside the magnet from the
south pole to the north pole, thus completing a closed loop.

</p><p class="paragraph">Although magnetic lines of force are imaginary, a simplified version of many magnetic phenomena
can be explained by assuming the magnetic lines to have certain real properties. The lines of force can be
compared to rubber bands which stretch outward when a force is exerted upon them and contract when
the force is removed. The characteristics of magnetic lines of force can be described as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Magnetic lines of force are continuous and will always form closed loops.
2. Magnetic lines of force will never cross one another.
3. Parallel magnetic lines of force traveling in the same direction repel one another. Parallel

</h2><p class="paragraph">MAGNETIC FLUX. The total number of magnetic lines of force leaving or entering the pole of a
magnet is called MAGNETIC FLUX. The number of flux lines per unit area is known as FLUX
DENSITY.
</p><p class="paragraph">FIELD INTENSITY. The intensity of a magnetic field is directly related to the magnetic force
exerted by the field.
</p><p class="paragraph">ATTRACTION/REPULSION. The intensity of attraction or repulsion between magnetic poles may
be described by a law almost identical to Coulomb’s Law of Charged Bodies. The force between two
poles is directly proportional to the product of the pole strengths and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between the poles.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Magnetic Induction
</h3><p class="paragraph">It has been previously stated that all substances that are attracted by a magnet are capable of
becoming magnetized. The fact that a material is attracted by a magnet indicates the material must itself
be a magnet at the time of attraction.
</p><p class="paragraph">With the knowledge of magnetic fields and magnetic lines of force developed up to this point, it is
simple to understand the manner in which a material becomes magnetized when brought near a magnet.
As an iron nail is brought close to a bar magnet (fig. 1-16), some flux lines emanating from the north pole
of the magnet pass through the iron nail in completing their magnetic path. Since magnetic lines of force
travel inside a magnet from the south pole to the north pole, the nail will be magnetized in such a polarity
that its south pole will be adjacent to the north pole of the bar magnet. There is now an attraction between
the two magnets.
</p><p class="paragraph">If another nail is brought in contact with the end of the first nail, it would be magnetized by
induction. This process could be repeated until the strength of the magnetic flux weakens as distance from</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">the bar magnet increases. However, as soon as the first iron nail is pulled away from the bar magnet, all
the nails will fall. The reason being that each nail becomes a temporary magnet, and as soon as the
magnetizing force is removed, their domains once again assume a random distribution.
</p><p class="paragraph">Magnetic induction will always produce a pole polarity on the material being magnetized opposite
that of the adjacent pole of the magnetizing force. It is sometimes possible to bring a weak north pole of a
magnet near a strong magnet north pole and note attraction between the poles. The weak magnet, when
placed within the magnetic field of the strong magnet, has its magnetic polarity reversed by the field of
the stronger magnet. Therefore, it is attracted to the opposite pole. For this reason, you must keep a very
weak magnet, such as a compass needle, away from a strong magnet.
</p><p class="paragraph">Magnetism can be induced in a magnetic material by several means. The magnetic material may be
placed in the magnetic field, brought into contact with a magnet, or stroked by a magnet. Stroking and
contact both indicate actual contact with the material but are considered in magnetic studies as
magnetizing by INDUCTION.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Magnetic Shielding
</h3><p class="paragraph">There is no known INSULATOR for magnetic flux. If a nonmagnetic material is placed in a
magnetic field, there is no appreciable change in flux—that is, the flux penetrates the nonmagnetic
material. For example, a glass plate placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet will have no
appreciable effect on the field although glass itself is a good insulator in an electric circuit. If a magnetic
material (for example, soft iron) is placed in a magnetic field, the flux may be redirected to take
advantage of the greater permeability of the magnetic material, as shown in figure 1-17. Permeability, as
discussed earlier, is the quality of a substance which determines the ease with which it can be magnetized.
</p><p class="paragraph">The sensitive mechanisms of electric instruments and meters can be influenced by stray magnetic
fields which will cause errors in their readings. Because instrument mechanisms cannot be insulated
against magnetic flux, it is necessary to employ some means of directing the flux around the instrument.
This is accomplished by placing a soft-iron case, called a MAGNETIC SCREEN or SHIELD, about the
instrument. Because the flux is established more readily through the iron (even though the path is longer)
than through the air inside the case, the instrument is effectively shielded, as shown by the watch and soft-
iron shield in figure 1-18.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Because of the many uses of magnets, they are found in various shapes and sizes. However, magnets
usually come under one of three general classifications: bar magnets, horseshoe magnets, or ring magnets.
</p><p class="paragraph">The bar magnet is most often used in schools and laboratories for studying the properties and effects
of magnetism. In the preceding material, the bar magnet proved very helpful in demonstrating magnetic
effects.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another type of magnet is the ring magnet, which is used for computer memory cores. A common
application for a temporary ring magnet would be the shielding of electrical instruments.
</p><p class="paragraph">The shape of the magnet most frequently used in electrical and electronic equipment is called the
horseshoe magnet. A horseshoe magnet is similar to a bar magnet but is bent in the shape of a horseshoe.
The horseshoe magnet provides much more magnetic strength than a bar magnet of the same size and
material because of the closeness of the magnetic poles. The magnetic strength from one pole to the other
is greatly increased due to the concentration of the magnetic field in a smaller area. Electrical measuring
devices quite frequently use horseshoe-type magnets.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A piece of steel that has been magnetized can lose much of its magnetism by improper handling. If it

magnetism. Had this piece of steel formed the horseshoe magnet of a meter, the meter would no longer be</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

containing magnets. Severe jarring or subjecting the instrument to high temperatures will damage the
device.
</p><p class="paragraph">A magnet may also become weakened from loss of flux. Thus when storing magnets, one should
always try to avoid excess leakage of magnetic flux. A horseshoe magnet should always be stored with a
keeper, a soft iron bar used to join the magnetic poles. By using the keeper while the magnet is being
stored, the magnetic flux will continuously circulate through the magnet and not leak off into space.
</p><p class="paragraph">When bar magnets are stored, the same principle must be remembered. Therefore, bar magnets
should always be stored in pairs with a north pole and a south pole placed together. This provides a
complete path for the magnetic flux without any flux leakage.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRICAL-ENERGY-1-25-">ELECTRICAL ENERGY
</h2><p class="paragraph">In the field of physical science, work must be defined as the PRODUCT OF FORCE AND
DISPLACEMENT. That is, the force applied to move an object and the distance the object is moved are
the factors of work performed.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is important to notice that no work is accomplished unless the force applied causes a change in the
position of a stationary object, or a change in the velocity of a moving object. A worker may tire by
pushing against a heavy wooden crate, but unless the crate moves, no work will be accomplished.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ENERGY-1-25-">ENERGY
</h2><p class="paragraph">In our study of energy and work, we must define energy as THE ABILITY TO DO WORK. In order
to perform any kind of work, energy must be expended (converted from one form to another). Energy
supplies the required force, or power, whenever any work is accomplished.
</p><p class="paragraph">One form of energy is that which is contained by an object in motion. When a hammer is set in
motion in the direction of a nail, it possesses energy of motion. As the hammer strikes the nail, the energy
of motion is converted into work as the nail is driven into the wood. The distance the nail is driven into
the wood depends on the velocity of the hammer at the time it strikes the nail. Energy contained by an
object due to its motion is called KINETIC ENERGY. Assume that the hammer is suspended by a string
in a position one meter above a nail. As a result of gravitational attraction, the hammer will experience a
force pulling it downward. If the string is suddenly cut, the force of gravity will pull the hammer
downward against the nail, driving it into the wood. While the hammer is suspended above the nail it has
ability to do work because of its elevated position in the earth’s gravitational field. Since energy is the
ability to do work, the hammer contains energy.
</p><p class="paragraph">Energy contained by an object due to its position is called POTENTIAL ENERGY. The amount of
potential energy available is equal to the product of the force required to elevate the hammer and the
height to which it is elevated.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another example of potential energy is that contained in a tightly coiled spring. The amount of
energy released when the spring unwinds depends on the amount of force required to wind the spring
initially.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Electrical Charges
</h3><p class="paragraph">From the previous study of electrostatics, you learned that a field of force exists in the space
surrounding any electrical charge. The strength of the field is directly dependent on the force of the
charge.
</p><p class="paragraph">The charge of one electron might be used as a unit of electrical charge, since charges are created by
displacement of electrons; but the charge of one electron is so small that it is impractical to use. The
practical unit adopted for measuring charges is the COULOMB, named after the scientist Charles
Coulomb. One coulomb is equal to the charge of 6,280,000,000,000,000,000 (six quintillion two hundred
and eighty quadrillion) or (6.28 x 1018 ) electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a charge of one coulomb exists between two bodies, one unit of electrical potential energy
exists, which is called the difference of potential between the two bodies. This is referred to as
ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE, or VOLTAGE, and the unit of measure is the VOLT.
</p><p class="paragraph">Electrical charges are created by the displacement of electrons, so that there exists an excess of
electrons at one point, and a deficiency at another point. Consequently, a charge must always have either
a negative or positive polarity. A body with an excess of electrons is considered to be negative, whereas a
body with a deficiency of electrons is positive.
</p><p class="paragraph">A difference of potential can exist between two points, or bodies, only if they have different charges.
In other words, there is no difference in potential between two bodies if both have a deficiency of
electrons to the same degree. If, however, one body is deficient of 6 coulombs (representing 6 volts), and
the other is deficient by 12 coulombs (representing 12 volts), there is a difference of potential of 6 volts.
The body with the greater deficiency is positive with respect to the other.
</p><p class="paragraph">In most electrical circuits only the difference of potential between two points is of importance and
the absolute potentials of the points are of little concern. Very often it is convenient to use one standard
reference for all of the various potentials throughout a piece of equipment. For this reason, the potentials
at various points in a circuit are generally measured with respect to the metal chassis on which all parts of
the circuit are mounted. The chassis is considered to be at zero potential and all other potentials are either
positive or negative with respect to the chassis. When used as the reference point, the chassis is said to be
at GROUND POTENTIAL.
</p><p class="paragraph">Occasionally, rather large values of voltage may be encountered, in which case the volt becomes too
small a unit for convenience. In a situation of this nature, the kilovolt (kV), meaning 1,000 volts, is
frequently used. As an example, 20,000 volts would be written as 20 kV. In other cases, the volt may be
too large a unit, as when dealing with very small voltages. For this purpose the millivolt (mV), meaning
one-thousandth of a volt, and the microvolt (µV), meaning one-millionth of a volt, are used. For example,
0.001 volt would be written as 1 mV, and 0.000025 volt would be written as 25 µV. See Appendix II for
exponential symbology.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a difference in potential exists between two charged bodies that are connected by a conductor,
electrons will flow along the conductor. This flow is from the negatively charged body to the positively
charged body, until the two charges are equalized and the potential difference no longer exists.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

1-19. At first the valve is closed and all the water is in tank A. Thus, the water pressure across the valve is
at maximum. When the valve is opened, the water flows through the pipe from A to B until the water level
becomes the same in both tanks. The water then stops flowing in the pipe, because there is no longer a
difference in water pressure between the two tanks.
</p><p class="paragraph">Electron movement through an electric circuit is directly proportional to the difference in potential or
electromotive force (emf), across the circuit, just as the flow of water through the pipe in figure 1-19 is
directly proportional to the difference in water level in the two tanks.

decreased, the flow is decreased.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-HOW-VOLTAGE-IS-PRODUCED-1-27-">HOW VOLTAGE IS PRODUCED
</h2><p class="paragraph">It has been demonstrated that a charge can be produced by rubbing a rubber rod with fur. Because of
the friction involved, the rod acquires electrons from the fur, making it negative; the fur becomes positive
due to the loss of electrons. These quantities of charge constitute a difference of potential between the rod
and the fur. The electrons which make up this difference of potential are capable of doing work if a
discharge is allowed to occur.
</p><p class="paragraph">To be a practical source of voltage, the potential difference must not be allowed to dissipate, but
must be maintained continuously. As one electron leaves the concentration of negative charge, another
must be immediately provided to take its place or the charge will eventually diminish to the point where
no further work can be accomplished. A VOLTAGE SOURCE, therefore, is a device which is capable of
supplying and maintaining voltage while some type of electrical apparatus is connected to its terminals.
The internal action of the source is such that electrons are continuously removed from one terminal,
keeping it positive, and simultaneously supplied to the second terminal which maintains a negative
charge.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Presently, there are six known methods for producing a voltage or electromotive force (emf). Some
of these methods are more widely used than others, and some are used mostly for specific applications.
Following is a list of the six known methods of producing a voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">1. FRICTION—Voltage produced by rubbing certain materials together.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. PRESSURE (piezoelectricity)—Voltage produced by squeezing crystals of certain substances.
3. HEAT (thermoelectricity)—Voltage produced by heating the joint (junction) where two unlike
</p><p class="paragraph">metals are joined.
4. LIGHT (photoelectricity)—Voltage produced by light striking photosensitive (light sensitive)
</p><p class="paragraph">substances.
</p><p class="paragraph">5. CHEMICAL ACTION—Voltage produced by chemical reaction in a battery cell.
</p><p class="paragraph">6. MAGNETISM—Voltage produced in a conductor when the conductor moves through a
magnetic field, or a magnetic field moves through the conductor in such a manner as to cut the
magnetic lines of force of the field.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Voltage Produced by Friction
</h3><p class="paragraph">The first method discovered for creating a voltage was that of generation by friction. The
development of charges by rubbing a rod with fur is a prime example of the way in which a voltage is
generated by friction. Because of the nature of the materials with which this voltage is generated, it
cannot be conveniently used or maintained. For this reason, very little practical use has been found for
voltages generated by this method.
</p><p class="paragraph">In the search for methods to produce a voltage of a larger amplitude and of a more practical nature,
machines were developed in which charges were transferred from one terminal to another by means of
rotating glass discs or moving belts. The most notable of these machines is the Van de Graaff generator. It
is used today to produce potentials in the order of millions of volts for nuclear research. As these
machines have little value outside the field of research, their theory of operation will not be described
here.
</p><p class="question"> Q39. A device which supplies a voltage is commonly referred to by what name?
Voltage Produced by Pressure
</p><p class="paragraph">One specialized method of generating an emf utilizes the characteristics of certain ionic crystals such
as quartz, Rochelle salts, and tourmaline. These crystals have the remarkable ability to generate a voltage
whenever stresses are applied to their surfaces. Thus, if a crystal of quartz is squeezed, charges of
opposite polarity will appear on two opposite surfaces of the crystal. If the force is reversed and the
crystal is stretched, charges will again appear, but will be of the opposite polarity from those produced by
squeezing. If a crystal of this type is given a vibratory motion, it will produce a voltage of reversing
polarity between two of its sides. Quartz or similar crystals can thus be used to convert mechanical energy
into electrical energy. This phenomenon, called the PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT, is shown in figure 1-20.
Some of the common devices that make use of piezoelectric crystals are microphones, phonograph
cartridges, and oscillators used in radio transmitters, radio receivers, and sonar equipment. This method of
generating an emf is not suitable for applications having large voltage or power requirements, but is
widely used in sound and communications systems where small signal voltages can be effectively used.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Crystals of this type also possess another interesting property, the "converse piezoelectric effect."
That is, they have the ability to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. A voltage impressed
across the proper surfaces of the crystal will cause it to expand or contract its surfaces in response to the
voltage applied.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Voltage Produced by Heat
</h3><p class="paragraph">When a length of metal, such as copper, is heated at one end, electrons tend to move away from the
hot end toward the cooler end. This is true of most metals. However, in some metals, such as iron, the
opposite takes place and electrons tend to move TOWARD the hot end. These characteristics are
illustrated in figure 1-21. The negative charges (electrons) are moving through the copper away from the
heat and through the iron toward the heat. They cross from the iron to the copper through the current
meter to the iron at the cold junction. This device is generally referred to as a THERMOCOUPLE.

</p><p class="paragraph">Thermocouples have somewhat greater power capacities than crystals, but their capacity is still very
small if compared to some other sources. The thermoelectric voltage in a thermocouple depends mainly
on the difference in temperature between the hot and cold junctions. Consequently, they are widely used
to measure temperature, and as heat-sensing devices in automatic temperature control equipment.
Thermocouples generally can be subjected to much greater temperatures than ordinary thermometers,
such as the mercury or alcohol types.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Voltage Produced by Light
</h3><p class="paragraph">When light strikes the surface of a substance, it may dislodge electrons from their orbits around the
surface atoms of the substance. This occurs because light has energy, the same as any moving force.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some substances, mostly metallic ones, are far more sensitive to light than others. That is, more
electrons will be dislodged and emitted from the surface of a highly sensitive metal, with a given amount
of light, than will be emitted from a less sensitive substance. Upon losing electrons, the photosensitive
(light-sensitive) metal becomes positively charged, and an electric force is created. Voltage produced in
this manner is referred to as a PHOTOELECTRIC VOLTAGE.
</p><p class="paragraph">The photosensitive materials most commonly used to produce a photoelectric voltage are various
compounds of silver oxide or copper oxide. A complete device which operates on the photoelectric
principle is referred to as a "photoelectric cell." There are many different sizes and types of photoelectric
cells in use, and each serves the special purpose for which it is designed. Nearly all, however, have some
of the basic features of the photoelectric cells shown in figure 1-22.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The cell (fig. 1-22 view A) has a curved light-sensitive surface focused on the central anode. When
light from the direction shown strikes the sensitive surface, it emits electrons toward the anode. The more
intense the light, the greater the number of electrons emitted. When a wire is connected between the
filament and the back, or dark side of the cell, the accumulated electrons will flow to the dark side. These
electrons will eventually pass through the metal of the reflector and replace the electrons leaving the light-
sensitive surface. Thus, light energy is converted to a flow of electrons, and a usable current is developed.
</p><p class="paragraph">The cell (fig. 1-22 view B) is constructed in layers. A base plate of pure copper is coated with light-
sensitive copper oxide. An extremely thin semitransparent layer of metal is placed over the copper oxide.

</h3><p class="paragraph">Voltage may be produced chemically when certain substances are exposed to chemical action.
</p><p class="paragraph">If two dissimilar substances (usually metals or metallic materials) are immersed in a solution that
produces a greater chemical action on one substance than on the other, a difference of potential will exist
between the two. If a conductor is then connected between them, electrons will flow through the
conductor to equalize the charge. This arrangement is called a primary cell. The two metallic pieces are
called electrodes and the solution is called the electrolyte. The voltaic cell illustrated in figure 1-23 is a
simple example of a primary cell. The difference of potential results from the fact that material from one
or both of the electrodes goes into solution in the electrolyte, and in the process, ions form in the vicinity
of the electrodes. Due to the electric field associated with the charged ions, the electrodes acquire charges.
</p><p class="paragraph">The amount of difference in potential between the electrodes depends principally on the metals used.
The type of electrolyte and the size of the cell have little or no effect on the potential difference produced.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two types of primary cells, the wet cell and the dry cell. In a wet cell the electrolyte is a
liquid. A cell with a liquid electrolyte must remain in an upright position and is not readily transportable.
An automotive battery is an example of this type of cell. The dry cell, much more commonly used than
the wet cell, is not actually dry, but contains an electrolyte mixed with other materials to form a paste.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Voltage Produced by Magnetism
</h3><p class="paragraph">Magnets or magnetic devices are used for thousands of different jobs. One of the most useful and
widely employed applications of magnets is in the production of vast quantities of electric power from
mechanical sources. The mechanical power may be provided by a number of different sources, such as
gasoline or diesel engines, and water or steam turbines. However, the final conversion of these source
energies to electricity is done by generators employing the principle of electromagnetic induction. These
generators, of many types and sizes, are discussed in other modules in this series. The important subject to
be discussed here is the fundamental operating principle of ALL such electromagnetic-induction
generators.
</p><p class="paragraph">To begin with, there are three fundamental conditions which must exist before a voltage can be
produced by magnetism.
</p><p class="paragraph">1. There must be a CONDUCTOR in which the voltage will be produced.
2. There must be a MAGNETIC FIELD in the conductor’s vicinity.
3. There must be relative motion between the field and conductor. The conductor must be moved so
</p><p class="paragraph">as to cut across the magnetic lines of force, or the field must be moved so that the lines of force
are cut by the conductor.
</p><p class="paragraph">In accordance with these conditions, when a conductor or conductors MOVE ACROSS a magnetic
field so as to cut the lines of force, electrons WITHIN THE CONDUCTOR are propelled in one direction
or another. Thus, an electric force, or voltage, is created.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 1-24, note the presence of the three conditions needed for creating an induced voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">1. A magnetic field exists between the poles of the C-shaped magnet.
2. There is a conductor (copper wire).
3. There is a relative motion. The wire is moved back and forth ACROSS the magnetic field.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 1-24 view A, the conductor is moving TOWARD the front of the page and the electrons
move from left to right. The movement of the electrons occurs because of the magnetically induced emf
acting on the electrons in the copper. The right-hand end becomes negative, and the left-hand end
positive. The conductor is stopped at view B, motion is eliminated (one of the three required conditions),
and there is no longer an induced emf. Consequently, there is no longer any difference in potential
between the two ends of the wire. The conductor at view C is moving away from the front of the page. An
induced emf is again created. However, note carefully that the REVERSAL OF MOTION has caused a
REVERSAL OF DIRECTION in the induced emf.
</p><p class="paragraph">If a path for electron flow is provided between the ends of the conductor, electrons will leave the
negative end and flow to the positive end. This condition is shown in part view D. Electron flow will
continue as long as the emf exists. In studying figure 1-24, it should be noted that the induced emf could
also have been created by holding the conductor stationary and moving the magnetic field back and forth.

</h2><p class="paragraph">It has been proven that electrons (negative charges) move through a conductor in response to an
electric field. ELECTRON CURRENT FLOW will be used throughout this explanation. Electron current
is defined as the directed flow of electrons. The direction of electron movement is from a region of
negative potential to a region of positive potential. Therefore electric current can be said to flow from
negative to positive. The direction of current flow in a material is determined by the polarity of the
applied voltage. NOTE: In some electrical/electronic communities, the direction of current flow is
recognized as being from positive to negative.
</p><p class="question"> Q45. According to electron theory, an electric current flows from what potential to what potential?
Random Drift
</p><p class="paragraph">All materials are composed of atoms, each of which is capable of being ionized. If some form of
energy, such as heat, is applied to a material, some electrons acquire sufficient energy to move to a higher
energy level. As a result, some electrons are freed from their parent atom’s which then becomes ions.
Other forms of energy, particularly light or an electric field, will cause ionization to occur.
</p><p class="paragraph">The number of free electrons resulting from ionization is dependent upon the quantity of energy
applied to a material, as well as the atomic structure of the material. At room temperature some materials,
classified as conductors, have an abundance of free electrons. Under a similar condition, materials
classified as insulators have relatively few free electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">In a study of electric current, conductors are of major concern. Conductors are made up of atoms that
contain loosely bound electrons in their outer orbits. Due to the effects of increased energy, these
outermost electrons frequently break away from their atoms and freely drift throughout the material. The</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-35
</p><p class="paragraph">free electrons, also called mobile electrons, take a path that is not predictable and drift about the material
in a haphazard manner. Consequently such a movement is termed RANDOM DRIFT.
</p><p class="paragraph">It is important to emphasize that the random drift of electrons occurs in all materials. The degree of
random drift is greater in a conductor than in an insulator.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Directed Drift
</h3><p class="paragraph">Associated with every charged body there is an electrostatic field. Bodies that are charged alike repel
one another and bodies with unlike charges attract each other. An electron will be affected by an
electrostatic field in exactly the same manner as any negatively charged body. It is repelled by a negative
charge and attracted by a positive charge. If a conductor has a difference in potential impressed across it,
as shown in figure 1-25, a direction is imparted to the random drift. This causes the mobile electrons to be
repelled away from the negative terminal and attracted toward the positive terminal. This constitutes a
general migration of electrons from one end of the conductor to the other. The directed migration of
mobile electrons due to the potential difference is called DIRECTED DRIFT.
</p><p class="paragraph">The directed movement of the electrons occurs at a relatively low VELOCITY (rate of motion in a
particular direction). The effect of this directed movement, however, is felt almost instantaneously, as
explained by the use of figure 1-26. As a difference in potential is impressed across the conductor, the
positive terminal of the battery attracts electrons from point A. Point A now has a deficiency of electrons.
As a result, electrons are attracted from point B to point A. Point B has now developed an electron
deficiency, therefore, it will attract electrons. This same effect occurs throughout the conductor and
repeats itself from points D to C. At the same instant the positive battery terminal attracted electrons from
point A, the negative terminal repelled electrons toward point D. These electrons are attracted to point D
as it gives up electrons to point C. This process is continuous for as long as a difference of potential exists
across the conductor. Though an individual electron moves quite slowly through the conductor, the effect
of a directed drift occurs almost instantaneously. As an electron moves into the conductor at point D, an
electron is leaving at point A. This action takes place at approximately the speed a light (186,000 miles
Per Second).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="question"> Q46. The effects of directed drift take place at what rate of speed?
Magnitude of Current Flow
</p><p class="paragraph">Electric current has been defined as the directed movement of electrons. Directed drift, therefore, is
current and the terms can be used interchangeably. The expression directed drift is particularly helpful in
differentiating between the random and directed motion of electrons. However, CURRENT FLOW is the
terminology most commonly used in indicating a directed movement of electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnitude of current flow is directly related to the amount of energy that passes through a
conductor as a result of the drift action. An increase in the number of energy carriers (the mobile
electrons) or an increase in the energy of the existing mobile electrons would provide an increase in
current flow. When an electric potential is impressed across a conductor, there is an increase in the
velocity of the mobile electrons causing an increase in the energy of the carriers. There is also the
generation of an increased number of electrons providing added carriers of energy. The additional number
of free electrons is relatively small, hence the magnitude of current flow is primarily dependent on the
velocity of the existing mobile electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnitude of current flow is affected by the difference of potential in the following manner.
Initially, mobile electrons are given additional energy because of the repelling and attracting electrostatic
field. If the potential difference is increased, the electric field will be stronger, the amount of energy
imparted to a mobile electron will be greater, and the current will be increased. If the potential difference
is decreased, the strength of the field is reduced, the energy supplied to the electron is diminished, and the
current is decreased.
</p><p class="question"> Q47. What is the relationship of current to voltage in a circuit?
Measurement of Current
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnitude of current is measured in AMPERES. A current of one ampere is said to flow when
one coulomb of charge passes a point in one second. Remember, one coulomb is equal to the charge of
6.28 x 1018  electrons.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

MILLIAMPERE (mA), one-thousandth of an ampere, or the MICROAMPERE ( $���RQH�PLOOLRQWK�RI�DQ
ampere, is used. The device used to measure current is called an AMMETER and will be discussed in
detail in a later module.
</p><p class="question"> Q48. Convert 350 mA to amperes.
ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE
</p><p class="paragraph">It is known that the directed movement of electrons constitutes a current flow. It is also known that
the electrons do not move freely through a conductor’s crystalline structure. Some materials offer little
opposition to current flow, while others greatly oppose current flow. This opposition to current flow is
known as RESISTANCE (R), and the unit of measure is the OHM. The standard of measure for one ohm
is the resistance provided at zero degrees Celsius by a column of mercury having a cross-sectional area of
one square millimeter and a length of 106.3 centimeters. A conductor has one ohm of resistance when an
applied potential of one volt produces a current of one ampere. The symbol used to represent the ohm is
WKH�*UHHN�OHWWHU�RPHJD�� ��
</p><p class="paragraph">Resistance, although an electrical property, is determined by the physical structure of a material. The
resistance of a material is governed by many of the same factors that control current flow. Therefore, in a
subsequent discussion, the factors that affect current flow will be used to assist in the explanation of the
factors affecting resistance.
</p><p class="question"> Q49. What is the symbol for ohm?
Factors That Affect Resistance
</p><p class="paragraph">The magnitude of resistance is determined in part by the "number of free electrons" available within
the material. Since a decrease in the number of free electrons will decrease the current flow, it can be said
that the opposition to current flow (resistance) is greater in a material with fewer free electrons. Thus, the
resistance of a material is determined by the number of free electrons available in a material.
</p><p class="paragraph">A knowledge of the conditions that limit current flow and, therefore, affect resistance can now be
used to consider how the type of material, physical dimensions, and temperature will affect the resistance
of a conductor.
</p><p class="paragraph">TYPE OF MATERIAL.—Depending upon their atomic structure, different materials will have
different quantities of free electrons. Therefore, the various conductors used in electrical applications
have different values of resistance.
</p><p class="paragraph">Consider a simple metallic substance. Most metals are crystalline in structure and consist of atoms
that are tightly bound in the lattice network. The atoms of such elements are so close together that the
electrons in the outer shell of the atom are associated with one atom as much as with its neighbor. (See
fig. 1-27 view A). As a result, the force of attachment of an outer electron with an individual atom is
practically zero. Depending on the metal, at least one electron, sometimes two, and in a few cases, three
electrons per atom exist in this state. In such a case, a relatively small amount of additional electron
energy would free the outer electrons from the attraction of the nucleus. At normal room temperature
materials of this type have many free electrons and are good conductors. Good conductors will have a low
resistance.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">If the atoms of a material are farther apart, as illustrated in figure 1-27 view B, the electrons in the
outer shells will not be equally attached to several atoms as they orbit the nucleus. They will be attracted
by the nucleus of the parent atom only. Therefore, a greater amount of energy is required to free any of
these electrons. Materials of this type are poor conductors and therefore have a high resistance.
</p><p class="paragraph">Silver, gold, and aluminum are good conductors. Therefore, materials composed of their atoms
would have a low resistance.
</p><p class="paragraph">The element copper is the conductor most widely used throughout electrical applications. Silver has
a lower resistance than copper but its cost limits usage to circuits where a high conductivity is demanded.
</p><p class="paragraph">Aluminum, which is considerably lighter than copper, is used as a conductor when weight is a major
factor.
</p><p class="question"> Q50. When would silver be used as a conductor in preference to copper?
EFFECT OF CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA.—Cross-sectional area greatly affects the magnitude
</p><p class="paragraph">of resistance. If the cross-sectional area of a conductor is increased, a greater quantity of electrons are
available for movement through the conductor. Therefore, a larger current will flow for a given amount of
applied voltage. An increase in current indicates that when the cross-sectional area of a conductor is
increased, the resistance must have decreased. If the cross-sectional area of a conductor is decreased, the
number of available electrons decreases and, for a given applied voltage, the current through the
conductor decreases. A decrease in current flow indicates that when the cross-sectional area of a
conductor is decreased, the resistance must have increased. Thus, the RESISTANCE OF A
CONDUCTOR IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA.
</p><p class="paragraph">The diameter of conductors used in electronics is often only a fraction of an inch, therefore, the
diameter is expressed in mils (thousandths of an inch). It is also standard practice to assign the unit
circular mil to the cross-sectional area of the conductor. The circular mil is found by squaring the
diameter when the diameter is expressed in mils. Thus, if the diameter is 35 mils (0.035 inch), the circular</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

illustrated in figure 1-28.
</p><p class="paragraph">EFFECT OF CONDUCTOR LENGTH.—The length of a conductor is also a factor which
determines the resistance of a conductor. If the length of a conductor is increased, the amount of energy
given up increases. As free electrons move from atom to atom some energy is given off as heat. The
longer a conductor is, the more energy is lost to heat. The additional energy loss subtracts from the energy
being transferred through the conductor, resulting in a decrease in current flow for a given applied
voltage. A decrease in current flow indicates an increase in resistance, since voltage was held constant.
Therefore, if the length of a conductor is increased, the resistance increases. THE RESISTANCE OF A
CONDUCTOR IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS LENGTH.

different ways. In some materials an increase in temperature causes an increase in resistance, whereas in
others, an increase in temperature causes a decrease in resistance. The amount of change of resistance per
unit change in temperature is known as the TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT. If for an increase in
temperature the resistance of a material increases, it is said to have a POSITIVE TEMPERATURE
COEFFICIENT. A material whose resistance decreases with an increase in temperature has a
NEGATIVE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT. Most conductors used in electronic applications have a
positive temperature coefficient. However, carbon, a frequently used material, is a substance having a
negative temperature coefficient. Several materials, such as the alloys constantan and manganin, are
considered to have a ZERO TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT because their resistance remains relatively
constant for changes in temperature.

Composition of Resistors
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the most common types of resistors is the molded composition, usually referred to as the
carbon resistor. These resistors are manufactured in a variety of sizes and shapes. The chemical
composition of the resistor determines its ohmic value and is accurately controlled by the manufacturer in
the development process. They are made in ohmic values that range from one ohm to millions of ohms.
The physical size of the resistor is related to its wattage rating, which is the ability of resistor to dissipate
heat caused by the resistance.
</p><p class="paragraph">Carbon resistors, as you might suspect, have as their principal ingredient the element carbon. In the
manufacturer of carbon resistors, fillers or binders are added to the carbon to obtain various resistor
values. Examples of these fillers are clay, bakelite, rubber, and talc. These fillers are doping agents and
cause the overall conduction characteristics to change.
</p><p class="paragraph">Carbon resistors are the most common resistors found because they are easy to manufacturer,
inexpensive, and have a tolerance that is adequate for most electrical and electronic applications. Their
prime disadvantage is that they have a tendency to change value as they age. One other disadvantage of
carbon resistors is their limited power handling capacity.
</p><p class="paragraph">The disadvantage of carbon resistors can be overcome by the use of WIREWOUND resistors (fig.

elements present in the wire determine the resistivity of the wire. (The resistivity of the wire is the
measure or ability of the wire to resist current. Usually the percent of nickel in the wire determines the
resistivity.) One disadvantage of the wirewound resistor is that it takes a large amount of wire to
manufacture a resistor of high ohmic value, thereby increasing the cost. A variation of the wirewound
resistor provides an exposed surface to the resistance wire on one side. An adjustable tap is attached to
this side. Such resistors, sometimes with two or more adjustable taps, are used as voltage dividers in
power supplies and other applications where a specific voltage is desired to be "tapped" off.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Fixed and Variable Resistors
</h3><p class="paragraph">There are two kinds of resistors, FIXED and VARIABLE. The fixed resistor will have one value and
will never change (other than through temperature, age, etc.). The resistors shown in A and B of figure 1-
29 are classed as fixed resistors. The tapped resistor illustrated in B has several fixed taps and makes
more than one resistance value available. The sliding contact resistor shown in C has an adjustable collar
that can be moved to tap off any resistance within the ohmic value range of the resistor.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two types of variable resistors, one called a POTENTIOMETER and the other a
RHEOSTAT (see views D and E of fig. 1-29.) An example of the potentiometer is the volume control on
your radio, and an example of the rheostat is the dimmer control for the dash lights in an automobile.
There is a slight difference between them. Rheostats usually have two connections, one fixed and the
other moveable. Any variable resistor can properly be called a rheostat. The potentiometer always has
three connections, two fixed and one moveable. Generally, the rheostat has a limited range of values and a
high current-handling capability. The potentiometer has a wide range of values, but it usually has a
limited current-handling capability. Potentiometers are always connected as voltage dividers. (Voltage
dividers are discussed in Chapter 3.)

 Q61. Which type of variable resistor should you select for controlling a large amount of current?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Wattage Rating
</h3><p class="paragraph">When a current is passed through a resistor, heat is developed within the resistor. The resistor must
be capable of dissipating this heat into the surrounding air; otherwise, the temperature of the resistor rises
causing a change in resistance, or possibly causing the resistor to burn out.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ability of the resistor to dissipate heat depends upon the design of the resistor itself. This ability
to dissipate heat depends on the amount of surface area which is exposed to the air. A resistor designed to
dissipate a large amount of heat must therefore have a large physical size. The heat dissipating capability
of a resistor is measured in WATTS (this unit will be explained later in chapter 3). Some of the more
common wattage ratings of carbon resistors are: one-eighth watt, one-fourth watt, one-half watt, one watt,
and two watts. In some of the newer state-of-the-art circuits of today, much smaller wattage resistors are
used. Generally, the type that you will be able to physically work with are of the values given. The higher
the wattage rating of the resistor the larger is the physical size. Resistors that dissipate very large amounts
of power (watts) are usually wirewound resistors. Wirewound resistors with wattage ratings up to 50</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">the actual value of the resistor may fall somewhere within 10 percent above and 10 percent below the
value indicated by the color code. This resistor has an indicated value of 27,000 ohms. Its tolerance is 10
percent x 27,000 ohms, or 2,700 ohms. Therefore, the resistor’s actual value is somewhere between
24,300 ohms and 29,700 ohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">When measuring resistors, you will find situations in which the quantities to be measured may be
extremely large, and the resulting number using the basic unit, the ohm, may prove too cumbersome.
Therefore, a metric system prefix is usually attached to the basic unit of measurement to provide a more
manageable unit. Two of the most commonly used prefixes are kilo and mega. Kilo is the prefix used to
represent thousand and is abbreviated k. Mega is the prefix used to represent million and is abbreviated
M.

</p><p class="paragraph">serious. If you make a miscue on the third band, you are in trouble, because the value is going to be at
least 10 times too high or too low. Some important points to remember about the third band are:
</p><p class="paragraph">When the third band is . . . .
</p><p class="paragraph">Black, the resistor’s value is less than 100 ohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">Brown, the resistor’s value is in hundreds of ohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">Red, the resistor’s value is in thousands of ohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">Orange, the resistor’s value is in tens of thousands of ohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">Yellow, the resistor’s value is in hundreds of thousands of ohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">Green, the resistor’s value is in megohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">Blue, the resistor’s value is in tens of megohms or more.
</p><p class="paragraph">Although you may find any of the above colors in the third band, red, orange, and yellow are the
most common. In some cases, the third band will be silver or gold. You multiply the first two bands by
0.01 if it is silver, and 0.1 if it is gold.
</p><p class="paragraph">The fourth band, which is the tolerance band, usually does not present too much of a problem. If
there is no fourth band, the resistor has a 20-percent tolerance; a silver fourth band indicates a 10-percent
tolerance; and a gold fourth band indicates a 5-percent tolerance. Resistors that conform to military
specifications have a fifth band. The fifth band indicates the reliability level per 1,000 hours of operation
as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">Fifth band color Level
Brown 1.0%
Red 0.1%
Orange 0.01%
Yellow 0.001%
</p><p class="paragraph">For a resistor whose the fifth band is color coded brown, the resistor’s chance of failure will not
exceed 1 percent for every 1,000 hours of operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">In equipment such as the Navy’s complex computers, the reliability level is very significant. For
example, in a piece of equipment containing 10,000 orange fifth-band resistors, no more than one resistor
will fail during 1,000 hours of operation. This is very good reliability. More information on resistors is
contained in NEETS Module 19.

</h1><p class="paragraph">With the completion of this chapter, you now have gained the necessary information which is the
foundation for the further study of electricity. The following is a summary of the important parts in the
chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">In describing the composition of matter, the following terms are important for you to remember:
</p><p class="paragraph">MATTER is defined as anything that occupies space and has weight.
</p><p class="paragraph">AN ELEMENT is a substance which cannot be reduced to a simpler substance by chemical means.
</p><p class="paragraph">A COMPOUND is a chemical combination of elements which can be separated by chemical means,
but not by physical means. It is created by chemically combining two or more elements.
</p><p class="paragraph">A MIXTURE is a combination of elements or compounds that can be separated by physical means.
</p><p class="paragraph">A MOLECULE is the chemical combination of two or more atoms. In a compound, the molecule is
the smallest particle that has all the characteristics of the compound.
</p><p class="paragraph">AN ATOM is the smallest particle of an element that retains the characteristics of that element. An
atom is made up of electrons, protons, and neutrons. The number and arrangement of these subatomic
particles determine the kind of element.
</p><p class="paragraph">AN ELECTRON is considered to be a negative charge of electricity.
</p><p class="paragraph">A PROTON is considered to be a positive charge of electricity.
</p><p class="paragraph">A NEUTRON is a neutral particle in that it has no electrical charge.
</p><p class="paragraph">ENERGY in an electron is of two types—kinetic (energy of motion) and potential (energy of
position).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">ENERGY LEVELS of the electron exist because the electron has mass and motion. The motion
gives it kinetic energy and its position gives it potential energy. Energy balance keeps the electron in orbit
and should it gain energy it will assume an orbit further from the center of the atom. It will remain at that
level for only a fraction of a second before it radiates the excess energy and goes back to a lower orbit.
</p><p class="paragraph">SHELLS AND SUBSHELLS of electrons are the orbits of the electrons in the atom. Each shell
contains a maximum of 2 times its number squared electrons. Shells are lettered K through Q, starting
with K, which is the closest to the nucleus. The shell can be split into 4 subshells labeled s, p, d, and f,
which can contain 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons, respectively.
</p><p class="paragraph">VALENCE OF AN ATOM is determined by the number of electrons in the outermost shell. The
shell is referred to as the valence shell, and the electrons within it are valence electrons. An atom with few
valence electrons requires little energy to free the valence electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">IONIZATION refers to the electrons contained in an atom. An atom with a positive charge has lost
some of its electrons, and is called a positive ion. A negatively charged atom is a negative ion.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

number of valence electrons in their atoms. The conductor normally has 3 or less valence electrons and
offers little opposition to the flow of electrons (electric current). The insulator contains 5 or more valence
electrons and offers high opposition to electron flow. The semiconductor usually has four valence
electrons of conductivity and is in the midrange. The best conductors in order of conductance are silver,
copper, gold, and aluminum.
</p><p class="paragraph">CHARGED BODIES affect each other as follows: When two bodies having unequal charges are
brought close to each other, they will tend to attract each other in an attempt to equalize their respective
charges. When two bodies, both having either positive or negative charges, are brought close together,
they tend to repel each other as no equalization can occur. When the charge on one body is high enough
with respect to the charge on an adjacent body, an equalizing current will flow between the bodies
regardless of the conductivity of the material containing the bodies.
</p><p class="paragraph">A NEUTRAL BODY may be attracted to either a positively or negatively charged body due to the
relative difference in their respective charges.
</p><p class="paragraph">CHARGED BODIES will attract or repel each other with a force that is directly proportional to the
product of their individual charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the
bodies.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In addition, the care, maintenance, and operation of batteries, as well as some of the safety 
precautions that should be followed while working with and around batteries are discussed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Batteries are widely used as sources of direct-current electrical energy in automobiles, boats, aircraft, 
ships, portable electric/electronic equipment, and lighting equipment. In some instances, they are used as 
the only source of power; while in others, they are used as a secondary or standby power source. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A battery consists of a number of cells assembled in a common container and connected together to 
function as a source of electrical power. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-CELL-2-2-">THE CELL 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A cell is a device that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy. The simplest cell, known as 
either a galvanic or voltaic cell, is shown in figure 2-1. It consists of a piece of carbon (C) and a piece of 
zinc (Zn) suspended in a jar that contains a solution of water (H20) and sulfuric acid (H2S0 4) called the 
electrolyte. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The cell is the fundamental unit of the battery. A simple cell consists of two electrodes placed in a 
container that holds the electrolyte. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In some cells the container acts as one of the electrodes and, in this case, is acted upon by the 
electrolyte. This will be covered in more detail later. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRODES-2-2-">ELECTRODES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The electrodes are the conductors by which the current leaves or returns to the electrolyte. In the 
simple cell, they are carbon and zinc strips that are placed in the electrolyte; while in the dry cell (fig. 
2-2), they are the carbon rod in the center and zinc container in which the cell is assembled. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

for electron flow, may be a salt, an acid, or an alkaline solution. In the simple galvanic cell, the electrolyte 
is in a liquid form. In the dry cell, the electrolyte is a paste. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CONTAINER-2-3-">CONTAINER 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The container which may be constructed of one of many different materials provides a means of 
holding (containing) the electrolyte. The container is also used to mount the electrodes. In the voltaic cell 
the container must be constructed of a material that will not be acted upon by the electrolyte.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PRIMARY-CELL-2-3-">PRIMARY CELL 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A primary cell is one in which the chemical action eats away one of the electrodes, usually the 
negative electrode. When this happens, the electrode must be replaced or the cell must be discarded. In 
the galvanic-type cell, the zinc electrode and the liquid electrolyte are usually replaced when this happens. 
In the case of the dry cell, it is usually cheaper to buy a new cell. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SECONDARY-CELL-2-3-">SECONDARY CELL 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A secondary cell is one in which the electrodes and the electrolyte are altered by the chemical action 
that takes place when the cell delivers current. These cells may be restored to their original condition by 
forcing an electric current through them in the direction opposite to that of discharge. The automobile 
storage battery is a common example of the secondary cell. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTROCHEMICAL-ACTION-2-4-">ELECTROCHEMICAL ACTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">If a load (a device that consumes electrical power) is connected externally to the electrodes of a cell, 
electrons will flow under the influence of a difference in potential across the electrodes from the 
CATHODE (negative electrode), through the external conductor to the ANODE (positive electrode). 
</p><p class="paragraph">A cell is a device in which chemical energy is converted to electrical energy. This process is called 
ELECTROCHEMICAL action. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltage across the electrodes depends upon the materials from which the electrodes are made 
and the composition of the electrolyte. The current that a cell delivers depends upon the resistance of the 
entire circuit, including that of the cell itself. The internal resistance of the cell depends upon the size of 
the electrodes, the distance between them in the electrolyte, and the resistance of the electrolyte. The 
larger the electrodes and the closer together they are in the electrolyte (without touching), the lower the 
internal resistance of the cell and the more current the cell is capable of supplying to the load. 
</p><p class="question">Q6. What is electrochemical action? 
</p><p class="question">Q7. What is another name for the (a) positive electrode, and the (b) negative electrode? 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PRIMARY-CELL-CHEMISTRY-2-4-">PRIMARY CELL CHEMISTRY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">When a current flows through a primary cell having carbon and zinc electrodes and a diluted solution 
of sulfuric acid and water (combined to form the electrolyte), the following chemical reaction takes place. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The current flow through the load is the movement of electrons from the negative electrode of the 
cell (zinc) and to the positive electrode (carbon). This causes fewer electrons in the zinc and an excess of 
electrons in the carbon. Figure 2-1 shows the hydrogen ions (H2) from the sulfuric acid being attracted to 
the carbon electrode. Since the hydrogen ions are positively charged, they are attracted to the negative 
charge on the carbon electrode. This negative charge is caused by the excess of electrons. The zinc 
electrode has a positive charge because it has lost electrons to the carbon electrode. This positive charge 
attracts the negative ions (S04) from the sulfuric acid. The negative ions combine with the zinc to form 
zinc sulfate. This action causes the zinc electrode to be eaten away. Zinc sulfate is a grayish-white 
substance that is sometimes seen on the battery post of an automobile battery. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The process of the zinc being eaten away and the sulfuric acid changing to hydrogen and zinc sulfate 
is the cause of the cell discharging. When the zinc is used up, the voltage of the cell is reduced to zero. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 2-1 you will notice that the zinc electrode is labeled negative and the carbon electrode is 
labeled positive. This represents the current flow outside the cell from negative to positive. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The zinc combines with the sulfuric acid to form zinc sulfate and hydrogen. The zinc sulfate 
dissolves in the electrolyte (sulfuric acid and water) and the hydrogen appears as gas bubbles around the 
carbon electrode. As current continues to flow, the zinc gradually dissolves and the solution changes to 
zinc sulfate and water. The carbon electrode does not enter into the chemical changes taking place, but 
simply provides a return path for the current. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">As stated before, the differences between primary and secondary cells are, the secondary cell can be 
recharged and the electrodes are made of different materials. The secondary cell shown in figure 2-3 uses 
sponge lead as the cathode and lead peroxide as the anode. This is the lead-acid type cell and will be used 
to explain the general chemistry of the secondary cell. Later in the chapter when other types of secondary 
cells are discussed, you will see that the materials which make up the parts of a cell are different, but that 
the chemical action is essentially the same.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-3 view A shows a lead-acid secondary cell that is fully charged. The cathode is pure sponge 
lead, the anode is pure lead peroxide, and the electrolyte is a mixture of sulfuric acid and water. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-3 view B shows the secondary cell discharging. A load is connected between the cathode 
and anode; current flows negative to positive as shown. This current flow creates the same process as was 
explained for the primary cell with the following exceptions. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the primary cell the zinc cathode was eaten away by the sulfuric acid. In the secondary cell the 
sponge-like construction of the cathode retains the lead sulfate formed by the chemical action of the 
sulfuric acid and the lead. In the primary cell the carbon anode was not chemically acted upon by the 
sulfuric acid. In the secondary cell the lead peroxide anode is chemically changed to lead sulfate by the 
sulfuric acid. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the cell is fully discharged it will be as shown in figure 2-3 view C. The anode and cathode 
retain some lead peroxide and sponge lead but the amounts of lead sulfate in each is maximum. The 
electrolyte has a minimum amount of sulfuric acid. With this condition no further chemical action can 
take place within the cell. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As you know, the secondary cell can be recharged. Recharging is the process of reversing the 
chemical action that occurs as the cell discharges. To recharge the cell, a voltage source, such as a 
generator, is connected as shown in figure 2-3 view D. The negative terminal of the voltage source is 
connected to the cathode of the cell and the positive terminal of the voltage source is connected to the 
anode of the cell. With this arrangement the lead sulfate is chemically changed back to sponge lead in the 
cathode, lead peroxide in the anode, and sulfuric acid in the electrolyte. After all the lead sulfate is 
chemically changed, the cell is fully charged as shown in figure 2-3 view A. Once the cell has been 
charged, the discharge-charge cycle may be repeated. 
</p><p class="question">Q11. Refer to figure 2-3(B). Why is the sulfuric acid decreasing? 
</p><p class="question">Q12. Refer to figure 2-3(D). How is it possible for the sulfuric acid to be increasing? 
</p><p class="question">Q13. Refer to figure 2-3(D). When all the lead sulfate has been converted, what is the condition of the 
cell? 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-POLARIZATION-OF-THE-CELL-2-6-">POLARIZATION OF THE CELL 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The chemical action that occurs in the cell while the current is flowing causes hydrogen bubbles to 
form on the surface of the anode. This action is called POLARIZATION. Some hydrogen bubbles rise to 
the surface of the electrolyte and escape into the air, some remain on the surface of the anode. If enough 
bubbles remain around the anode, the bubbles form a barrier that increases internal resistance. When the 
internal resistance of the cell increases, the output current is decreased and the voltage of the cell also 
decreases. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A cell that is heavily polarized has no useful output. There are several methods to prevent 
polarization or to depolarize the cell. 
</p><p class="paragraph">One method uses a vent on the cell to permit the hydrogen to escape into the air. A disadvantage of 
this method is that hydrogen is not available to reform into the electrolyte during recharging. This 
problem is solved by adding water to the electrolyte, such as in an automobile battery. A second method 
is to use material that is rich in oxygen, such as manganese dioxide, which supplies free oxygen to 
combine with the hydrogen and form water. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

cell is practically free from polarization. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LOCAL-ACTION-2-7-">LOCAL ACTION 
</h2><p class="paragraph">When the external circuit is removed, the current ceases to flow, and, theoretically, all chemical 
action within the cell stops. However, commercial zinc contains many impurities, such as iron, carbon, 
lead, and arsenic. These impurities form many small electrical cells within the zinc electrode in which 
current flows between the zinc and its impurities. Thus, the chemical action continues even though the 
cell itself is not connected to a load. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Local action may be prevented by using pure zinc (which is not practical), by coating the zinc with 
mercury, or by adding a small percentage of mercury to the zinc during the manufacturing process. The 
treatment of the zinc with mercury is called amalgamating (mixing) the zinc. Since mercury is many 
times heavier than an equal volume of water, small particles of impurities weighing less than mercury will 
float to the surface of the mercury. The removal of these impurities from the zinc prevents local action. 
The mercury is not readily acted upon by the acid. When the cell is delivering current to a load, the 
mercury continues to act on the impurities in the zinc. This causes the impurities to leave the surface of 
the zinc electrode and float to the surface of the mercury. This process greatly increases the storage life of 
the cell.

virtually impossible to have a complete knowledge of all the various types. A few recent developments 
are the silver-zinc, nickel-zinc, nickel-cadmium, silver-cadmium, organic and inorganic lithium, and 
mercury cells. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-PRIMARY-DRY-CELL-2-7-">PRIMARY DRY CELL 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The dry cell is the most popular type of primary cell. It is ideal for simple applications where an 
inexpensive and noncritical source of electricity is all that is needed. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The dry cell is not actually dry. The electrolyte is not in a liquid state, but is a moist paste. If it 
should become totally dry, it would no longer be able to transform chemical energy to electrical energy. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Construction of a Dry Cell 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The construction of a common type of dry cell is shown in figure 2-4. These dry cells are also 
referred to as Leclanche' cells. The internal parts of the cell are located in a cylindrical zinc container. 
This zinc container serves as the negative electrode (cathode) of the cell. The container is lined with a 
nonconducting material, such as blotting paper, to separate the zinc from the paste. A carbon electrode is 
located in the center, and it serves as the positive terminal (anode) of the cell. The paste is a mixture of 
several substances such as ammonium chloride, powdered coke, ground carbon, manganese dioxide, zinc 
chloride, graphite, and water. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">This paste, which is packed in the space between the anode and the blotting paper, also serves to 
hold the anode rigid in the center of the cell. When the paste is packed in the cell, a small space is left at 
the top for expansion of the electrolytic paste caused by the depolarization action. The cell is then sealed 
with a cardboard or plastic seal. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the zinc container is the cathode, it must be protected with some insulating material to be 
electrically isolated. Therefore, it is common practice for the manufacturer to enclose the cells in 
cardboard and metal containers. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The dry cell (fig. 2-4) is basically the same as the simple voltaic cell (wet cell) described earlier, as 
far as its internal chemical action is concerned. The action of the water and the ammonium chloride in the 
paste, together with the zinc and carbon electrodes, produces the voltage of the cell. Manganese dioxide is 
added to reduce polarization when current flows and zinc chloride reduces local action when the cell is 
not being used. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A cell that is not being used (sitting on the shelf) will gradually deteriorate because of slow internal 
chemical changes (local action). This deterioration is usually very slow if cells are properly stored. If 
unused cells are stored in a cool place, their shelf life will be greatly preserved. Therefore, to minimize 
deterioration, they should be stored in refrigerated spaces. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The blotting paper (paste-coated pulpboard separator) serves two purposes—(1) it keeps the paste 
from making actual contact with the zinc container and (2) it permits the electrolyte from the paste to 
filter through to the zinc slowly. The cell is sealed at the top to keep air from entering and drying the 
electrolyte. Care should be taken to prevent breaking this seal.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Mercuric-Oxide Zinc Cell 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The mercuric-oxide zinc cell (mercury cell) is a primary cell that was developed during World War 
II. Two important assets of the mercury cell are its ability to produce current for a long period of time and 
a long shelf life when compared to the dry cell shown in figure 2-4. The mercury cell also has a very 
stable output voltage and is a power source that can be made in a small physical size. 
</p><p class="paragraph">With the birth of the space program and the development of small transceivers and miniaturized 
equipment, a power source of small size was needed. Such equipment requires a small cell which is 
capable of delivering maximum electrical energy at a constant discharge voltage. The mercury cell, which 
is one of the smallest cells, meets these requirements. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Present mercury cells are manufactured in three basic types as shown in figure 2-5. The wound-
anode type, shown in figure 2-5 view A, has an anode composed of a corrugated zinc strip with a paper 
absorbent. The zinc is mixed with mercury, and the paper is soaked in the electrolyte which causes it to 
swell and press against the zinc and make positive contact. This process ensures that the electrolyte makes 
contact with the anode. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the pressed-powder cells, shown in figure 2-5 views B and C, the zinc powder for the anode is 
mixed prior to being pressed into shape. The absorbent shown in the figure is paper soaked in the 
electrolyte. The space between the inner and outer containers provides passage for any gas generated by 
an improper chemical balance or impurities present within the cell. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the anode and cathode of a cell are connected together without a load, a SHORT CIRCUIT 
condition exists. Short circuits (shorts) can be very dangerous. They cause excessive heat, pressure, and 
current flow which may cause serious damage to the cell or be a safety hazard to personnel. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">There are many different types of primary cells. Because of such factors as cost, size, ease of 
replacement, and voltage or current needs, many types of primary cells have been developed. The 
following is a brief description of some of the primary cells in use today. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Manganese Dioxide-Alkaline-Zinc Cell is similar to the zinc-carbon cell except for the 
electrolyte used. This type of cell offers better voltage stability and longer life than the zinc-carbon type. 
It also has a longer shelf life and can operate over a wide temperature range. The manganese dioxide-
alkaline-zinc cell has a voltage of 1.5 volts and is available in a wide range of sizes. This cell is 
commonly referred to as the alkaline cell. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Magnesium-Manganese Dioxide Cell uses magnesium as the anode material. This allows a 
higher output capacity over an extended period of time compared to the zinc-carbon cell. This cell 
produces a voltage of approximately 2 volts. The disadvantage of this type of cell is the production of 
hydrogen during its operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The Lithium-Organic Cell and the Lithium-Inorganic Cell are recent developments of a new line of 
high-energy cells. The main advantages of these types of cells are very high power, operation over a wide 
temperature range, they are lighter than most cells, and have a remarkably long shelf life of up to 20 
years.

</p><h3 class="subsection">Nickel-Cadmium Cell 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The nickel-cadmium cell (NICAD) is far superior to the lead-acid cell. In comparison to lead-acid 
cells, these cells generally require less maintenance throughout their service life in regard to the adding of 
electrolyte or water. The major difference between the nickel-cadmium cell and the lead-acid cell is the 
material used in the cathode, anode, and electrolyte. In the nickel-cadmium cell the cathode is cadmium 
hydroxide, the anode is nickel hydroxide, and the electrolyte is potassium hydroxide and water. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The nickel-cadmium and lead-acid cells have capacities that are comparable at normal discharge 
rates, but at high discharge rates the nickel-cadmium cell can deliver a larger amount of power. In 
addition the nickel-cadmium cell can: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Be charged in a shorter time, 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Stay idle longer in any state of charge and keep a full charge when stored for a longer period of 
time, and 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Be charged and discharged any number of times without any appreciable damage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Due to their superior capabilities, nickel-cadmium cells are being used extensively in many military 
applications that require a cell with a high discharge rate. A good example is in the aircraft storage 
battery. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Silver-Zinc Cells 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The silver-zinc cell is used extensively to power emergency equipment. This type of cell is relatively 
expensive and can be charged and discharged fewer times than other types of cells. When compared to the 
lead-acid or nickel-cadmium cells, these disadvantages are overweighed by the light weight, small size, 
and good electrical capacity of the silver-zinc cell. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The silver-zinc cell uses the same electrolyte as the nickel-cadmium cell (potassium hydroxide and 
water), but the anode and cathode differ from the nickel-cadmium cell. The anode is composed of silver 
oxide and the cathode is made of zinc. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Silver-Cadmium Cell 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The silver-cadmium cell is a fairly recent development for use in storage batteries. The silver-
cadmium cell combines some of the better features of the nickel-cadmium and silver-zinc cells. It has 
more than twice the shelf life of the silver-zinc cell and can be recharged many more times. The 
disadvantages of the silver-cadmium cell are high cost and low voltage production. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The electrolyte of the silver-cadmium cell is potassium hydroxide and water as in the nickel-
cadmium and silver-zinc cells. The anode is silver oxide as in the silver-zinc cell and the cathode is 
cadmium hydroxide as in the nicad cell. You may notice that different combinations of materials are used 
to form the electrolyte, cathode, and anode of different cells. These combinations provide the cells with 
different qualities for many varied applications.

battery is applied to a single cell, such as the flashlight battery. In the case of a flashlight that uses a 
battery of 1.5 volts, the battery is a single cell. The flashlight that is operated by 6 volts uses four cells in 
a single case and this is a battery composed of more than one cell. There are three ways to combine cells 
to form a battery. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-COMBINING-CELLS-2-12-">COMBINING CELLS 
</h2><p class="paragraph">In many cases, a battery-powered device may require more electrical energy than one cell can 
provide. The device may require either a higher voltage or more current, and in some cases both. Under 
such conditions it is necessary to combine, or interconnect, a sufficient number of cells to meet the higher 
requirements. Cells connected in SERIES provide a higher voltage, while cells connected in PARALLEL 
provide a higher current capacity. To provide adequate power when both voltage and current 
requirements are greater than the capacity of one cell, a combination SERIES-PARALLEL network of 
cells must be used. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Series-Connected Cells 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Assume that a load requires a power supply of 6 volts and a current capacity of 1/8 ampere. Since a 
single cell normally supplies a voltage of only 1.5 volts, more than one cell is needed. To obtain the 
higher voltage, the cells are connected in series as shown in figure 2-6.

output terminal voltage is 1.5 × 4, or 6 volts. When connected to the load, 1/8 ampere flows through the 
load and each cell of the battery. This is within the capacity of each cell. Therefore, only four 
series-connected cells are needed to supply this particular load.

across the battery and would not only quickly discharge the cells but could cause 
some types of cells to explode. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Parallel-Connected Cells 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In this case, assume an electrical load requires only 1.5 volts, but will require 1/2 ampere of current. 
(Assume that a single cell will supply only 1/8 ampere.) To meet this requirement, the cells are connected 
in parallel, as shown in figure 2-7 view A and schematically represented in 2-7 view B. In a parallel 
connection, all positive cell electrodes are connected to one line, and all negative electrodes are connected 
to the other. No more than one cell is connected between the lines at any one point; so the voltage 
between the lines is the same as that of one cell, or 1.5 volts. However, each cell may contribute its 
maximum allowable current of 1/8 ampere to the line. There are four cells, so the total line current is 
1/8 × 4, or 1/2 ampere. In this case four cells in parallel have enough capacity to supply a load requiring 
1/2 ampere at 1.5 volts.

</p><p class="paragraph">The active ingredient in electrolyte (sulfuric acid, potassium hydroxide, etc.) is heavier than water. 
Therefore, the electrolyte has a specific gravity greater than 1.0. The acceptable range of specific gravity 
for a given battery is provided by the battery's manufacturer. To measure a battery's specific gravity, use 
an instrument called a HYDROMETER. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Hydrometer 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A hydrometer, shown in figure 2-12, is a glass syringe with a float inside it. The float is a hollow 
glass tube sealed at both ends and weighted at the bottom end, with a scale calibrated in specific gravity 
marked on its side. To test an electrolyte, draw it into the hydrometer using the suction bulb. Draw 
enough electrolyte into the hydrometer to make the float rise. Do not draw in so much electrolyte that the 
float rises into the suction bulb. The float will rise to a point determined by the specific gravity of the 
electrolyte. If the electrolyte contains a large amount of active ingredient, its specific gravity will be 
relatively high. The float will rise higher than it would if the electrolyte contained only a small amount of 
active ingredient. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">To read the hydrometer, hold it in a vertical position and read the scale at the point that surface of the 
electrolyte touches the float. Refer to the manufacturer's technical manual to determine whether or not the 
battery's specific gravity is within specifications. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Note: Hydrometers should be flushed with fresh water after each use to prevent inaccurate readings. 
Storage battery hydrometers must not be used for any other purpose.

specific gravity 1.125? 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Other Maintenance 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The routine maintenance of a battery is very simple. Terminals should be checked periodically for 
cleanliness and good electrical connection. The battery case should be inspected for cleanliness and 
evidence of damage. The level of electrolyte should be checked and if the electrolyte is low, distilled 
water should be added to bring the electrolyte to the proper level. Maintenance procedures for batteries 
are normally determined by higher authority and each command will have detailed procedures for battery 
care and maintenance. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Safety Precautions With Batteries 
</h3><p class="paragraph">All types of batteries should be handled with care: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. NEVER SHORT THE TERMINALS OF A BATTERY. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. CARRYING STRAPS SHOULD BE USED WHEN TRANSPORTING BATTERIES. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. PROTECTIVE CLOTHING, SUCH AS RUBBER APRON, RUBBER GLOVES, AND A 
FACE SHIELD SHOULD BE WORN WHEN WORKING WITH BATTERIES. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. NO SMOKING, ELECTRIC SPARKS, OR OPEN FLAMES SHOULD BE PERMITTED 
NEAR CHARGING BATTERIES. 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO PREVENT SPILLING OF THE ELECTROLYTE. 
</p><p class="paragraph">In the event electrolyte is splashed or spilled on a surface, such as the floor or table, it should be 
diluted with large quantities of water and cleaned up immediately. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If the electrolyte is spilled or splashed on the skin or eyes, IMMEDIATELY flush the skin or eyes 
with large quantities of fresh water for a minimum of 15 minutes. If the electrolyte is in the eyes, be sure 
the upper and lower eyelids are pulled out sufficiently to allow the fresh water to flush under the eyelids. 
The medical department should be notified as soon as possible and informed of the type of electrolyte and 
the location of the accident. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CAPACITY-AND-RATING-OF-BATTERIES-2-18-">CAPACITY AND RATING OF BATTERIES 
</h2><p class="paragraph">The CAPACITY of a battery is measured in ampere-hours. The ampere-hour capacity is equal to the 
product of the current in amperes and the time in hours during which the battery will supply this current. 
The ampere-hour capacity varies inversely with the discharge current. For example, a 400 ampere-hour 
battery will deliver 400 amperes for 1 hour or 100 amperes for 4 hours. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Storage batteries are RATED according to their rate of discharge and ampere-hour capacity. Most 
batteries are rated according to a 20-hour rate of discharge. That is, if a fully charged battery is 
completely discharged during a 20-hour period, it is discharged at the 20-hour rate. Thus, if a battery can 
deliver 20 amperes continuously for 20 hours, the battery has a rating of 20 amperes × 20 hours, or 400 
ampere-hours. Therefore, the 20-hour rating is equal to the average current that a battery is capable of 
supplying without interruption for an interval of 20 hours. (Note: Aircraft batteries are rated according to 
a 1-hour rate of discharge.) </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">All standard batteries deliver 100 percent of their available capacity if discharged in 20 hours or 
more, but they will deliver less than their available capacity if discharged at a faster rate. The faster they 
discharge, the less ampere-hour capacity they have. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The low-voltage limit, as specified by the manufacturer, is the limit beyond which very little useful 
energy can be obtained from a battery. This low-voltage limit is normally a test used in battery shops to 
determine the condition of a battery.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-BATTERY-CHARGING-2-19-">BATTERY CHARGING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">It should be remembered that adding the active ingredient to the electrolyte of a discharged battery 
does not recharge the battery. Adding the active ingredient only increases the specific gravity of the 
electrolyte and does not convert the plates back to active material, and so does not bring the battery back 
to a charged condition. A charging current must be passed through the battery to recharge it. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Batteries are usually charged in battery shops. Each shop will have specific charging procedures for 
the types of batteries to be charged. The following discussion will introduce you to the types of battery 
charges. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The following types of charges may be given to a storage battery, depending upon the condition of 
the battery: 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Initial charge 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Normal charge 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Equalizing charge 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Floating charge 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. Fast charge 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Initial Charge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When a new battery is shipped dry, the plates are in an uncharged condition. After the electrolyte has 
been added, it is necessary to charge the battery. This is accomplished by giving the battery a long low-
rate initial charge. The charge is given in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, which are 
shipped with each battery. If the manufacturer's instructions are not available, reference should be made 
to the detailed instructions for charging batteries found in current Navy directives. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Normal Charge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A normal charge is a routine charge that is given in accordance with the nameplate data during the 
ordinary cycle of operation to restore the battery to its charged condition. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Equalizing Charge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">An equalizing charge is a special extended normal charge that is given periodically to batteries as 
part of a maintenance routine. It ensures that all the sulfate is driven from the plates and that all the cells </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">are restored to a maximum specific gravity. The equalizing charge is continued until the specific gravity 
of all cells, corrected for temperature, shows no change for a 4-hour period. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Floating Charge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">In a floating charge, the charging rate is determined by the battery voltage rather than by a definite 
current value. The floating charge is used to keep a battery at full charge while the battery is idle or in 
light duty. It is sometimes referred to as a trickle charge and is accomplished with low current. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Fast Charge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">A fast charge is used when a battery must be recharged in the shortest possible time. The charge 
starts at a much higher rate than is normally used for charging. It should be used only in an emergency, as 
this type charge may be harmful to the battery. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Charging Rate 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Normally, the charging rate of Navy storage batteries is given on the battery nameplate. If the 
available charging equipment does not have the desired charging rates, the nearest available rates should 
be used. However, the rate should never be so high that violent gassing (explained later in this text) 
occurs. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Charging Time 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The charge must be continued until the battery is fully charged. Frequent readings of specific gravity 
should be taken during the charge and compared with the reading taken before the battery was placed on 
charge. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Gassing 
</h3><p class="paragraph">When a battery is being charged, a portion of the energy breaks down the water in the electrolyte. 
Hydrogen is released at the negative plates and oxygen at the positive plates. These gases bubble up 
through the electrolyte and collect in the air space at the top of the cell. If violent gassing occurs when the 
battery is first placed on charge, the charging rate is too high. If the rate is not too high, steady gassing 
develops as the charging proceeds, indicating that the battery is nearing a fully charged condition. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-WARNING-2-20-">WARNING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">A mixture of hydrogen and air can be dangerously explosive. No smoking, 
electric sparks, or open flames should be permitted near charging batteries.

batteries. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A CELL is a device that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy. The cell has three parts; 
the electrodes, the electrolyte, and the container. There are two basic cells: primary and secondary. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">THE ELECTRODES are the current conductors of the cell. 
</p><p class="paragraph">THE ELECTROLYTE is the solution that acts upon the electrodes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">THE CONTAINER holds the electrolyte and provides a means of mounting the electrodes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">THE PRIMARY CELL is a cell in which the chemical action finally destroys one of the electrodes, 
usually the negative. The primary cell cannot be recharged. 
</p><p class="paragraph">THE SECONDARY CELL is a cell in which the chemical action alters the electrodes and 
electrolyte. The electrodes and electrolyte can be restored to their original condition by recharging the 
cell. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">THE ANODE is the positive electrode of a cell. 
</p><p class="paragraph">THE CATHODE is the negative electrode of a cell. 
</p><p class="paragraph">PRIMARY CELL CHEMISTRY is the process in which electrons leaving the cathode to the load 
cause a positive charge which attracts negative ions from the electrolyte. The negative ions combine with 
the material of the cathode and form a substance such as lead-sulfate. Electrons from the load to the anode 
create a negative charge which attracts positive ions (hydrogen) from the electrolyte. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">SECONDARY CELL CHEMISTRY is the process in which the electrolyte acts upon and 
chemically changes both electrodes. This process also depletes the amount of active material in the 
electrolyte. A charging current applied to the cell reverses the process and restores the cell to its original 
condition. 
</p><p class="paragraph">POLARIZATION is the effect of hydrogen surrounding the anode of a cell which increases the 
internal resistance of the cell. Polarization can be prevented by venting the cell, adding a material rich in 
oxygen, or adding a material that will absorb hydrogen. 
</p><p class="paragraph">LOCAL ACTION is the continuation of current flow within the cell when there is no external load. 
It is caused by impurities in the electrode and can be prevented by the use of mercury amalgamated with 
the material of the electrode. 
</p><p class="paragraph">DRY CELL is the type commonly referred to as the "flashlight battery." Since the electrolyte is not 
in liquid form, but is a paste, the term dry cell is used. In most dry cells the case is the cathode.

electricity by electrochemical action. The anode is lead peroxide, the cathode is sponge lead, and the 
electrolyte is sulfuric acid and water.

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">THE NICKEL-CADMIUM CELL, commonly called the NICAD, has the following advantages

</h2><p class="paragraph">The material covered in this chapter contains many new terms that are explained as you progress
through the material. The basic dc circuit is the easiest to understand, so the chapter begins with the basic
circuit and from there works into the basic schematic diagram of that circuit. The schematic diagram is
used in all your future work in electricity and electronics. It is very important that you become familiar
with the symbols that are used.
</p><p class="paragraph">This chapter also explains how to determine the total resistance, current, voltage, and power in a
series, parallel, or combination circuit through the use of Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws. The voltage divider
network, series, parallel, and series-parallel practice problem circuits will be used for practical examples
of what you have learned.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-BASIC-ELECTRIC-CIRCUIT-3-2-">THE BASIC ELECTRIC CIRCUIT
</h2><p class="paragraph">The flashlight is an example of a basic electric circuit. It contains a source of electrical energy (the
dry cells in the flashlight), a load (the bulb) which changes the electrical energy into a more useful form
of energy (light), and a switch to control the energy delivered to the load.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before you study a schematic representation of the flashlight, it is necessary to define certain terms.
The LOAD is any device through which an electrical current flows and which changes this electrical
energy into a more useful form. Some common examples of loads are a lightbulb, which changes
electrical energy to light energy; an electric motor, which changes electrical energy into mechanical
energy; and the speaker in a radio, which changes electrical energy into sound. The SOURCE is the
device which furnishes the electrical energy used by the load. It may consist of a simple dry cell (as in a
flashlight), a storage battery (as in an automobile), or a power supply (such as a battery charger). The
SWITCH, which permits control of the electrical device, interrupts the current delivered to the load.

DIAGRAM. The schematic diagram is a "picture" of the circuit that uses symbols to represent the various
circuit components; physically large or complex circuits can be shown on a relatively small diagram.
Before studying the basic schematic, look at figure 3-1. This figure shows the symbols that are used in
this chapter. These, and others like them, are referred to and used throughout the study of electricity and

</p><h3 class="subsection">OHM’S LAW
</h3><p class="paragraph">In the early part of the 19th century, George Simon Ohm proved by experiment that a precise
relationship exists between current, voltage, and resistance. This relationship is called Ohm’s law and is
stated as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">The current in a circuit is DIRECTLY proportional to the applied voltage and INVERSELY
proportional to the circuit resistance. Ohm’s law may be expressed as an equation:
</p><p class="paragraph">As stated in Ohm’s law, current is inversely proportional to resistance. This means, as the resistance
in a circuit increases, the current decreases proportionately.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h3><p class="paragraph">if any two quantities are known, the third one can be determined. Refer to figure 3-2(B), the
schematic of the flashlight. If the battery (BAT) supplies a voltage of 1.5 volts and the lamp (DS1) has a
resistance of 5 ohms, then the current in the circuit can be determined. Using this equation and
substituting values:
</p><p class="paragraph">If the flashlight were a two-cell flashlight, we would have twice the voltage, or 3.0 volts, applied to
the circuit. Using this voltage in the equation:
</p><p class="paragraph">You can see that the current has doubled as the voltage has doubled.  This demonstrates that the
current is directly proportional  to the applied voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">If the value of resistance of the lamp is doubled, the equation will be:
</p><p class="paragraph">The current has been reduced to one half of the value of the previous equation, or .3 ampere. This
demonstrates that the current  is inversely proportional to the resistance. Doubling the value of the
resistance of the load reduces circuit current value to one half of its former value.
</p><h3 class="subsection">APPLICATION OF OHM’S LAW
</h3><p class="paragraph">By using Ohm’s law, you are able to find the resistance of a circuit, knowing only the voltage and the
current in the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">In any equation, if all the variables (parameters) are known except one, that unknown can be found.

GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BASIC CIRCUIT
</p><p class="paragraph">One of the most valuable methods of analyzing a circuit is by constructing a graph. No other method
provides a more convenient or more rapid way to observe the characteristics of an electrical device.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">3-9
</p><p class="paragraph">The first step in constructing a graph is to obtain a table of data. The information in the table can be
obtained by taking measurements on the circuit under examination, or can be obtained theoretically
through a series of Ohm’s law computations. The latter method is used here.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since there are three variables (E, I, and R) to be analyzed, there are three distinct graphs that may
be constructed.
</p><p class="paragraph">To construct any graph of electrical quantities, it is standard practice to vary one quantity in a
specified way and note the changes which occur in a second quantity. The quantity which is intentionally
varied is called the independent variable and is plotted on the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis is
known as the X-AXIS. The second quantity, which varies as a result of changes in the first quantity, is
called the dependent variable and is plotted on the vertical, or Y-AXIS. Any other quantities involved are
held constant.
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, in the circuit shown in figure 3-6, if the resistance was held at 10 ohms and the voltage
was varied, the resulting changes in current could then be graphed. The resistance is the constant, the
voltage is the independent variable, and the current is the dependent variable.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-7 shows the graph and a table of values. This table shows R held constant at 10 ohms as E
is varied from 0 to 20 volts in 5-volt steps. Through the use of Ohm’s law, you can calculate the value of
current for each value of voltage shown in the table. When the table is complete, the information it
contains can be used to construct the graph shown in figure 3-7. For example, when the voltage applied to
the 10-ohm resistor is 10 volts, the current is 1 ampere. These values of current and voltage determine a
point on the graph. When all five points have been plotted, a smooth curve is drawn through the points.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Through the use of this curve, the value of current through the resistor can be quickly determined for
any value of voltage between 0 and 20 volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the curve is a straight line, it shows that equal changes of voltage across the resistor produce
equal changes in current through the resistor. This fact illustrates an important characteristic of the basic
law—the current varies directly with the applied voltage when the resistance is held constant.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the voltage across a load is held constant, the current depends solely upon the resistance of the
load. For example, figure 3-8 shows a graph with the voltage held constant at 12 volts. The independent
variable is the resistance which is varied from 2 ohms to 12 ohms. The current is the dependent variable.
Values for current can be calculated as:

</p><p class="paragraph">This process can be continued for any value of resistance. You can see that as the resistance is
halved, the current is doubled; when the resistance is doubled, the current is halved.
</p><p class="paragraph">This illustrates another important characteristic of Ohm's law—current varies inversely with
resistance when the applied voltage is held constant.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-POWER-3-11-">POWER
</h2><p class="paragraph">Power, whether electrical or mechanical, pertains to the rate at which work is being done. Work is
done whenever a force causes motion. When a mechanical force is used to lift or move a weight, work is
done. However, force exerted WITHOUT causing motion, such as the force of a compressed spring acting
between two fixed objects, does not constitute work.
</p><p class="paragraph">Previously, it was shown that voltage is an electrical force, and that voltage forces current to flow in
a closed circuit. However, when voltage exists but current does not flow because the circuit is open, no
work is done. This is similar to the spring under tension that produced no motion. When voltage causes
electrons to move, work is done. The instantaneous RATE at which this work is done is called the electric
power rate, and is measured in WATTS.
</p><p class="paragraph">A total amount of work may be done in different lengths of time. For example, a given number of
electrons may be moved from one point to another in 1 second or in 1 hour, depending on the RATE at
which they are moved. In both cases, total work done is the same. However, when the work is done in a</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

work is done over a longer period of time.
</p><p class="paragraph">As stated, the basic unit of power is the watt. Power in watts is equal to the voltage across a circuit
multiplied by current through the circuit. This represents the rate at any given instant at which work is
being done. The symbol P indicates electrical power. Thus, the basic power formula is P = E x I, where E
is voltage and I is current in the circuit. The amount of power changes when either voltage or current, or
both voltage and current, are caused to change.
</p><p class="paragraph">In practice, the ONLY factors that can be changed are voltage and resistance. In explaining the
different forms that formulas may take, current is sometimes presented as a quantity that is changed.
Remember, if current is changed, it is because either voltage or resistance has been changed.

graph that indicates the relationship between voltage and power.
</p><p class="paragraph">The resistance of this circuit is 2 ohms; this value does not change. Voltage (E) is increased (by
increasing the voltage source), in steps of 1 volt, from 0 volts to 8 volts. By applying Ohm’s law, the
current (I) is determined for each step of voltage. For instance, when E is 1 volt, the current is:

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-POWER-RATING-3-17-">POWER RATING
</h2><p class="paragraph">Electrical components are often given a power rating. The power rating, in watts, indicates the rate at
which the device converts electrical energy into another form of energy, such as light, heat, or motion. An
example of such a rating is noted when comparing a 150-watt lamp to a 100-watt lamp. The higher
wattage rating of the 150-watt lamp indicates it is capable of converting more electrical energy into light
energy than the lamp of the lower rating. Other common examples of devices with power ratings are
soldering irons and small electric motors.
</p><p class="paragraph">In some electrical devices the wattage rating indicates the maximum power the device is designed to
use rather than the normal operating power. A 150-watt lamp, for example, uses 150 watts when operated
at the specified voltage printed on the bulb. In contrast, a device such as a resistor is not normally given a
voltage or a current rating. A resistor is given a power rating in watts and can be operated at any
combination of voltage and current as long as the power rating is not exceeded. In most circuits, the actual
power used by a resistor is considerably less than the power rating of the resistor because a 50% safety
factor is used. For example, if a resistor normally used 2 watts of power, a resistor with a power rating of
3 watts would be used.
</p><p class="paragraph">Resistors of the same resistance value are available in different wattage values. Carbon resistors, for
example, are commonly made in wattage ratings of 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, and 2 watts. The larger the physical
size of a carbon resistor the higher the wattage rating. This is true because a larger surface area of material
radiates a greater amount of heat more easily.
</p><p class="paragraph">When resistors with wattage ratings greater than 5 watts are needed, wirewound resistors are used.
Wirewound resistors are made in values between 5 and 200 watts. Special types of wirewound resistors
are used for power in excess of 200 watts.
</p><p class="paragraph">As with other electrical quantities, prefixes may be attached to the word watt when expressing very
large or very small amounts of power. Some of the more common of these are the kilowatt (1,000 watts),
the megawatt (1,000,000 watts), and the milliwatt (1/1,000 of a watt).

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-POWER-CONVERSION-AND-EFFICIENCY-3-18-">POWER CONVERSION AND EFFICIENCY
</h2><p class="paragraph">The term power consumption is common in the electrical field. It is applied to the use of power in
the same sense that gasoline consumption is applied to the use of fuel in an automobile.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another common term is power conversion. Power is used by electrical devices and is converted
from one form of energy to another. An electrical motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy.
An electric light bulb converts electrical energy into light energy and an electric range converts electrical
energy into heat energy. Power used by electrical devices is measured in energy. This practical unit of
electrical energy is equal to 1 watt of power used continuously for 1 hour. The term kilowatt hour (kWh)
is used more extensively on a daily basis and is equal to 1,000 watt-hours.
</p><p class="paragraph">The EFFICIENCY of an electrical device is the ratio of power converted to useful energy divided by
the power consumed by the device. This number will always be less than one (1.00) because of the losses
in any electrical device. If a device has an efficiency rating of .95, it effectively transforms 95 watts into
useful energy for every 100 watts of input power. The other 5 watts are lost to heat, or other losses which
cannot be used.
</p><p class="paragraph">Calculating the amount of power converted by an electrical device is a simple matter. You need to
know the length of time the device is operated and the input power or horsepower rating. Horsepower, a
unit of work, is often found as a rating on electrical motors. One horsepower is equal to 746 watts.

source is the total voltage across the circuit and is equal to the applied voltage. The total voltage across a
series circuit that consists of more than one resistor is also equal to the applied voltage, but consists of the
sum of the individual resistor voltage drops. In any series circuit, the SUM of the resistor voltage drops
must equal the source voltage. This statement can be proven by an examination of the circuit shown in
figure 3-17. In this circuit a source potential (ET) of 20 volts is dropped across a series circuit consisting
of two 5-ohm resistors. The total resistance of the circuit (RT) is equal to the sum of the two individual
resistances, or 10 ohms. Using Ohm’s law the circuit current may be calculated as follows:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

the voltages contained in a series circuit loop. Kirchhoff’s voltage law states:

</p><p class="paragraph">To state Kirchhoff’s law another way, the voltage drops and voltage sources in a circuit are equal at
any given moment in time. If the voltage sources are assumed to have one sign (positive or negative) at
that instant and the voltage drops are assumed to have the opposite sign, the result of adding the voltage
sources and voltage drops will be zero.
</p><p class="paragraph">NOTE: The terms electromotive force and emf are used when explaining Kirchhoff’s law because
Kirchhoff’s law is used in alternating current circuits (covered in Module 2). In applying Kirchhoff’s law
to direct current circuits, the terms electromotive force and emf apply to voltage sources such as batteries
or power supplies.
</p><p class="paragraph">Through the use of Kirchhoff’s law, circuit problems can be solved which would be difficult, and
often impossible, with knowledge of Ohm’s law alone. When Kirchhoff’s law is properly applied, an
equation can be set up for a closed loop and the unknown circuit values can be calculated.

</p><p class="paragraph">In the circuit shown in figure 3-22, the current is shown flowing in a counterclockwise direction.
Notice that the end of resistor R1, into which the current flows, is marked NEGATIVE (í���7KH�HQG�RI�51

end of R1 into which the current flows is at a higher negative potential than the end of the resistor at
which the current leaves. Point A is more negative than point B.
</p><p class="paragraph">Point C, which is at the same potential as point B, is labeled negative. This is to indicate that point C
is more negative than point D. To say a point is positive (or negative) without stating what the polarity is
based upon has no meaning. In working with Kirchhoff’s law, positive and negative polarities are
assigned in the direction of current flow.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">where Ea, Eb, etc., are the voltage drops or emf’s around any closed circuit loop. To set up the equation for
an actual circuit, the following procedure is used.
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Assume a direction of current through the circuit. (The correct direction is desirable but not
necessary.)
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Using the assumed direction of current, assign polarities to all resistors through which the
current flows.

</p><p class="paragraph">4. Starting at any point in the circuit, trace around the circuit, writing down the amount and polarity
of the voltage across each component in succession. The polarity used is the sign AFTER the
assumed current has passed through the component. Stop when the point at which the trace was
started is reached.
</p><p class="paragraph">5. Place these voltages, with their polarities, into the equation and solve for the desired quantity.

current is assumed (as shown). Using this current, the polarity markings are placed at each end of each

</h2><p class="paragraph">A short circuit is an accidental path of low resistance which passes an abnormally high amount of
current. A short circuit exists whenever the resistance of a circuit or the resistance of a part of a circuit
drops in value to almost zero ohms. A short often occurs as a result of improper wiring or broken
insulation.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-33, a short is caused by improper wiring. Note the effect on current flow. Since the
resistor has in effect been replaced with a piece of wire, practically all the current flows through the short
and very little current flows through the resistor. Electrons flow through the short (a path of almost zero
resistance) and the remainder of the circuit by passing through the 10-ohm resistor and the battery. The
amount of current flow increases greatly because its resistive path has decreased from 10,010 ohms to 10
ohms. Due to the excessive current flow the 10-ohm resistor becomes heated. As it attempts to dissipate
this heat, the resistor will probably be destroyed. Figure 3-34 shows a pictorial wiring diagram, rather

</h2><p class="paragraph">A meter connected across the terminals of a good 1.5-volt battery reads about 1.5 volts. When the
same battery is inserted into a complete circuit, the meter reading decreases to something less than 1.5
volts. This difference in terminal voltage is caused by the INTERNAL RESISTANCE of the battery (the
opposition to current offered by the electrolyte in the battery). All sources of electromotive force have
some form of internal resistance which causes a drop in terminal voltage as current flows through the
source.
</p><p class="paragraph">This principle is illustrated in figure 3-35, where the internal resistance of a battery is shown as Ri. In
the schematic, the internal resistance is indicated by an additional resistor in series with the battery. The
battery, with its internal resistance, is enclosed within the dotted lines of the schematic diagram. With the
switch open, the voltage across the battery terminals reads 15 volts. When the switch is closed, current
flow causes voltage drops around the circuit. The circuit current of 2 amperes causes a voltage drop of 2
volts across Ri. The 1-ohm internal battery resistance thereby drops the battery terminal voltage to 13
volts. Internal resistance cannot be measured directly with a meter. An attempt to do this would damage
the meter.
</p><p class="paragraph">The effect of the source resistance on the power output of a dc source may be shown by an analysis
of the circuit in figure 3-36. When the variable load resistor (RL) is set at the zero-ohm position

drawn from the source would decrease. Consequently, the voltage drop across the internal resistance

approach a maximum as the current approaches zero amps.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-POWER-TRANSFER-AND-EFFICIENCY-3-48-">POWER TRANSFER AND EFFICIENCY
</h2><p class="paragraph">Maximum power is transferred from the source to the load when the resistance of the load is equal to
the internal resistance of the source. This theory is illustrated in the table and the graph of figure 3-36.
When the load resistance is 5 ohms, matching the source resistance, the maximum power of 500 watts is
developed in the load.
</p><p class="paragraph">The efficiency of power transfer (ratio of output power to input power) from the source to the load
increases as the load resistance is increased. The efficiency approaches 100 percent as the load resistance
approaches a relatively large value compared with that of the source, since less power is lost in the source.
The efficiency of power transfer is only 50 percent at the maximum power transfer point (when the load
resistance equals the internal resistance of the source). The efficiency of power transfer approaches zero
efficiency when the load resistance is relatively small compared with the internal resistance of the source.
This is also shown on the chart of figure 3-36.
</p><p class="paragraph">The problem of a desire for both high efficiency and maximum power transfer is resolved by a
compromise between maximum power transfer and high efficiency. Where the amounts of power
involved are large and the efficiency is important, the load resistance is made large relative to the source
resistance so that the losses are kept small. In this case, the efficiency is high. Where the problem of
matching a source to a load is important, as in communications circuits, a strong signal may be more
important than a high percentage of efficiency. In such cases, the efficiency of power transfer should be
only about 50 percent; however, the power transfer would be the maximum which the source is capable of
supplying.

connected in series. An example of a basic parallel circuit is shown in figure 3-37.
</p><p class="paragraph">Start at the voltage source (Es) and trace counterclockwise around the circuit. Two complete and
separate paths can be identified in which current can flow. One path is traced from the source, through
resistance R1, and back to the source. The other path is from the source, through resistance R2, and back to
the source.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Voltage in a Parallel Circuit
</h3><p class="paragraph">You have seen that the source voltage in a series circuit divides proportionately across each resistor
in the circuit. IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT, THE SAME VOLTAGE IS PRESENT IN EACH BRANCH.
(A branch is a section of a circuit that has a complete path for current.) In figure 3-37 this voltage is equal
to the applied voltage (Es). This can be expressed in equation form as:
</p><h3 class="subsection">ES = ER1 = ER2

currents flow through their respective resistors and rejoin at junction b. The total current then flows from
junction b back to the positive terminal of the source. The source supplies a total current of 10 amperes

</p><p class="paragraph">Having computed all the currents and voltages of figure 3-54, a complete description of the
operation of the circuit can be made. The total current of 3 amps leaves the negative terminal of the
battery and flows through the 8-ohm resistor (R1). In so doing, a voltage drop of 24 volts occurs across
resistor R1. At point A, this 3-ampere current divides into two currents. Of the total current, 1.8 amps
flows through the 20-ohm resistor. The remaining current of 1.2 amps flows from point A, down through
the 30-ohm resistor to point B. This current produces a voltage drop of 36 volts across the 30-ohm
resistor. (Notice that the voltage drops across the 20- and 30-ohm resistors are the same.) The two branch
currents of 1.8 and 1.2 amps combine at junction B and the total current of 3 amps flows back to the
source. The action of the circuit has been completely described with the exception of power consumed,

EFFECTS OF OPEN AND SHORT CIRCUITS

deals with the effects on a circuit when an open or a short occurs.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The major difference between an open in a parallel circuit and an open in a series circuit is that in the
parallel circuit the open would not necessarily disable the circuit. If the open condition occurs in a series
portion of the circuit, there will be no current because there is no complete path for current flow. If, on the
other hand, the open occurs in a parallel path, some current will still flow in the circuit. The parallel
branch where the open occurs will be effectively disabled, total resistance of the circuit will INCREASE,
and total current will DECREASE.
</p><p class="paragraph">To clarify these points, figure 3-61 illustrates a series parallel circuit. First the effect of an open in
the series portion of this circuit will be examined. Figure 3-61(A) shows the normal circuit, RT = 40 ohms
and IT = 3 amps. In figure 3-61(B) an open is shown in the series portion of the circuit, there is no
complete path for current and the resistance of the circuit is considered to be infinite.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-61(C) an open is shown in the parallel branch of  R 3. There is no path for current through
R3.  In the circuit, current flows through R1  and R2 only. Since there is only one path for current flow, R1
and R2 are effectively in series.
</p><p class="paragraph">Under these conditions RT� ���� �DQG�,T = 1 amp. As you can see, when an open occurs in a parallel
branch, total circuit resistance increases and total circuit current decreases.

developed. In figure 3-62 (A) the normal circuit is shown. RT = 40 ohms and IT  = 3 amps.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-62 (B), R1 has shorted. R1 now has zero ohms of resistance. The total of the resistance of
the circuit is now equal to the resistance of the parallel network of R2  and R 3, or 20 ohms. Circuit current
has increased to 6 amps. All of this current goes through the parallel network (R2,  R 3) and this increase in
current would most likely damage the components.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-62 (C),  R 3 has shorted. With  R 3 shorted there is a short circuit in parallel with R2. The
short circuit routes the current around R2, effectively removing R2 from the circuit. Total circuit resistance
is now equal to the resistance of R1, or 20 ohms.
</p><p class="paragraph">As you know, R2  and R 3 form a parallel network. Resistance of the network can be calculated as
follows:

most likely damage R1. Notice that even though only one portion of the parallel network was shorted, the
entire paralleled network was disabled.
</p><p class="paragraph">Opens and shorts alike, if occurring in a circuit, result in an overall change in the equivalent
resistance. This can cause undesirable effects in other parts of the circuit due to the corresponding change
in the total current flow. A short usually causes components to fail in a circuit which is not properly fused
or otherwise protected. The failure may take the form of a burned-out resistor, damaged source, or a fire
in the circuit components and wiring.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fuses and other circuit protection devices are installed in equipment circuits to prevent damage
caused by increases in current. These circuit protection devices are designed to open if current increases
to a predetermined value. Circuit protection devices are connected in series with the circuit or portion of
the circuit that the device is protecting. When the circuit protection device opens, current flow ceases in
the circuit.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Most electrical and electronics equipment use voltages of various levels throughout their circuitry.
</p><p class="paragraph">One circuit may require a 90-volt supply, another a 150-volt supply, and still another a 180-volt
supply. These voltage requirements could be supplied by three individual power sources. This method is
expensive and requires a considerable amount of room. The most common method of supplying these
voltages is to use a single voltage source and a VOLTAGE DIVIDER. Before voltage dividers are
explained, a review of what was discussed earlier concerning voltage references may be of help.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">3-93
</p><p class="paragraph">As you know, some circuits are designed to supply both positive and negative voltages. Perhaps now
you wonder if a negative voltage has any less potential than a positive voltage. The answer is that 100
volts is 100 volts. Whether it is negative or positive does not affect the feeling you get when you are
shocked.
</p><p class="paragraph">Voltage polarities are considered as being positive or negative in respect to a reference point, usually
ground. Figure 3-63 will help to illustrate this point.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-63(A) shows a series circuit with a voltage source of 100 volts and four 50-ohm resistors
connected in series.  The ground, or reference point, is connected to one end of resistor R
</p><p class="paragraph"> 1. The current in
this circuit determined by Ohm’s law is .5 amp. Each resistor develops (drops) 25 volts. The five tap-off
points indicated in the schematic are points at which the voltage can be measured. As indicated on the
schematic, the voltage measured at each of the points from point A to point E starts at zero volts and
becomes more positive in 25 volt steps to a value of positive 100 volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">In figure 3-63(B), the ground, or reference point has been moved to point B. The current in the
circuit is still .5 amp and each resistor still develops 25 volts. The total voltage developed in the circuit
remains at 100 volts, but because the reference point has been changed, the voltage at point A is negative
25 volts. Point E, which was at positive 100 volts in figure 3-63(A), now has a voltage of positive 75
volts. As you can see the voltage at any point in the circuit is dependent on three factors; the current
through the resistor, the ohmic value of the resistor, and the reference point in the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">A typical voltage divider consists of two or more resistors connected in series across a source
voltage (Es). The source voltage must be as high or higher than any voltage developed by the voltage
divider. As the source voltage is dropped in successive steps through the series resistors, any desired</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">portion of the source voltage may be "tapped off" to supply individual voltage requirements. The values
of the series resistors used in the voltage divider are determined by the voltage and current requirements
of the loads.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-64 is used to illustrate the development of a simple voltage divider. The requirement for
this voltage divider is to provide a voltage of 25 volts and a current of 910 milliamps to the load from a
source voltage of 100 volts. Figure 3-64(A) provides a circuit in which 25 volts is available at point B. If
the load was connected between point B and ground, you might think that the load would be supplied
with 25 volts. This is not true since the load connected between point B and ground forms a parallel
network of the load and resistor R1. (Remember that the value of resistance of a parallel network is
always less than the value of the smallest resistor in the network.)
</p><p class="paragraph">Since the resistance of the network would now be less than 25 ohms, the voltage at point B would be
less than 25 volts. This would not satisfy the requirement of the load.
</p><p class="paragraph">To determine the size of resistor used in the voltage divider, a rule-of-thumb is used. The current in
the divider resistor should equal approximately 10 percent of the load current. This current, which does
not flow through any of the load devices, is called bleeder current.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRICAL-SAFETY-3-108-">ELECTRICAL SAFETY
</h2><p class="paragraph">Safety precautions must always be observed by persons working around electric circuits and
equipment to avoid injury from electric shock. Detailed safety precautions are contained in NAVMAT
P-5l00, Safety Precautions for Shore Activities and OPNAVINST 5l00-19, Navy Safety Precautions for
Forces Afloat.
</p><p class="paragraph">The danger of shock from a 450-volt ac electrical service system is well recognized by operating
personnel. This is shown by the relatively low number of reports of serious shock received from this
voltage, despite its widespread use. On the other hand, a number of fatalities have been reported due to
contact with low-voltage circuits. Despite a fairly widespread, but totally unfounded, popular belief to the
contrary, low-voltage circuits (115 volts and below) are very dangerous and can cause death when the
resistance of the body is lowered. Fundamentally, current, rather than voltage, is the measure of shock
intensity. The passage of even a very small current through a vital part of the human body can cause
DEATH. The voltage necessary to produce the fatal current is dependent upon the resistance of the body,
contact conditions, the path through the body, etc. For example, when a 60-hertz alternating current, is
passed through a human body from hand to hand or from hand to foot, and the current is gradually
increased, it will cause the following effects: At about 1 milliampere (0.001 ampere), the shock can be
felt; at about 10 milliamperes (0.01 ampere), the shock is of sufficient intensity to prevent voluntary
control of the muscles; and at about 100 milliamperes (0.1 ampere) the shock is fatal if it lasts for 1
second or more. The above figures are the results of numerous investigations and are approximate
because individuals differ in their resistance to electrical shock. It is most important to recognize that the
resistance of the human body cannot be relied upon to prevent a fatal shock from 115 volts or less—
FATALITIES FROM VOLTAGES AS LOW AS 30 VOLTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED. Tests have
shown that body resistance under unfavorable conditions may be as low as 300 ohms, and possibly as low
as 100 ohms from temple to temple if the skin is broken.
</p><p class="paragraph">Conditions aboard ship add to the chance of receiving an electrical shock. Aboard ship the body is
likely to be in contact with the metal structure of the ship and the body resistance may be low because of
perspiration or damp clothing. Extra care and awareness of electrical hazards aboard ship are needed.
</p><p class="paragraph">Short circuits can be caused by accidentally placing or dropping a metal tool, rule, flashlight case, or
other conducting article across an energized line. The arc and fire which result, even on relatively low-
voltage circuits, may cause extensive damage to equipment and serious injury to personnel.
</p><p class="paragraph">Since ship service power distribution systems are designed to be ungrounded, many persons believe
it is safe to touch one conductor, since no electrical current would flow. This is not true, since the
distribution system is not totally isolated from the hull of the ship. If one conductor of an ungrounded
electrical system is touched while the body is in contact with the hull of the ship or other metal equipment
enclosure, a fatal electric current may pass through the body. ALL LIVE ELECTRIC CIRCUITS SHALL
BE TREATED AS POTENTIAL HAZARDS AT ALL TIMES.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-DANGER-SIGNALS-3-108-">DANGER SIGNALS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Personnel should constantly be on the alert for any signs which might indicate a malfunction of
electric equipment. Besides the more obvious visual signs, the reaction of other senses, such as hearing,
smell, and touch, should also make you aware of possible electrical malfunctions. Examples of signs
which you must be alert for are: fire, smoke, sparks, arcing, or an unusual sound from an electric motor.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

shocks felt when handling electrical equipment; unusually hot running electric motors and other electrical
equipment; an odor of burning or overheated insulation; electrical equipment which either fails to operate
or operates irregularly; and electrical equipment which produces excessive vibrations are also indications
of malfunctions. When any of the above signs are noted, they are to be reported immediately to a
qualified technician. DO NOT DELAY. Do not operate faulty equipment. Above all, do not attempt to
make any repairs yourself if you are not qualified to do so. Stand clear of any suspected hazard and
instruct others to do likewise.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Warning Signs—They have been placed for your protection. To disregard them is to invite
personal injury as well as possible damage to equipment. Switches and receptacles with a
temporary warning tag, indicating work is being performed, are not to be touched.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Working Near Electrical Equipment—When work must be performed in the immediate vicinity
of electrical equipment, check with the technician responsible for the maintenance of the
equipment so you can avoid any potential hazards of which you may not be immediately aware.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Authorized Personnel Only—Because of the danger of fire, damage to equipment, and injury to
personnel, all repair and maintenance work on electrical equipment shall be done only by
authorized persons. Keep your hands off of all equipment which you have not been specifically
authorized to handle. Particularly stay clear of electrical equipment opened for inspection,
testing, or servicing.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Circuit Breakers and Fuses—Covers for all fuse boxes, junction boxes, switch boxes, and wiring
accessories should be kept closed. Any cover which is not closed or is missing should be
reported to the technician responsible for its maintenance. Failure to do so may result in injury to
personnel or damage to equipment in the event accidental contact is made with exposed live
circuits.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRICAL-FIRES-3-109-">ELECTRICAL FIRES
</h2><p class="paragraph">Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used in fighting electrical fires. It is nonconductive and, therefore, the safest
to use in terms of electrical safety. It also offers the least likelihood of damaging equipment. However, if
the discharge horn of a CO2 extinguisher is allowed to accidentally touch an energized circuit, the horn
may transmit a shock to the person handling the extinguisher.
</p><p class="paragraph">The very qualities which cause CO2 to be a valuable extinguishing agent also make it dangerous to
life. When it replaces oxygen in the air to the extent that combustion cannot be sustained, respiration also
cannot be sustained. Exposure of a person to an atmosphere of high concentration of CO2 will cause
suffocation.

</h2><p class="paragraph">A person who has stopped breathing is not necessarily dead, but is in immediate danger. Life is
dependent upon oxygen, which is breathed into the lungs and then carried by the blood to every body cell.
Since body cells cannot store oxygen, and since the blood can hold only a limited amount (and that only
for a short time), death will surely result from continued lack of breathing.

</p><p class="paragraph">oxygen, the body cells will not die immediately. For a very few minutes, there is some chance that the
person’s life may be saved.
</p><p class="paragraph">The process by which a person who has stopped breathing can be saved is called ARTIFICIAL
VENTILATION (RESPIRATION).
</p><p class="paragraph">The purpose of artificial ventilation is to force air out of the lungs and into the lungs, in rhythmic
alternation, until natural breathing is reestablished. Artificial ventilation should be given only when
natural breathing has stopped; it should NOT be given to any person who is breathing naturally. You
should not assume that an individual who is unconscious due to electrical shock has stopped breathing. To
tell if someone suffering from an electrical shock is breathing, place your hands on the person’s sides, at
the level of the lowest ribs. If the victim is breathing, you will usually be able to feel the movement.
Remember: DO NOT GIVE ARTIFICIAL VENTILATION TO A PERSON WHO IS BREATHING
NATURALLY.
</p><p class="paragraph">Records show that seven out of ten victims of electric shock were revived when artificial respiration
was started in less than 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, the chances of revival decrease rapidly.
</p><p class="paragraph">Once it has been determined that breathing has stopped, the person nearest the victim should start the
artificial ventilation without delay and send others for assistance and medical aid. The only logical,
permissible delay is that required to free the victim from contact with the electricity in the quickest, safest
way. This step, while it must be taken quickly, must be done with great care; otherwise, there may be two
victims instead of one. In the case of portable electric tools, lights, appliances, equipment, or portable
outlet extensions, this should be done by turning off the supply switch or by removing the plug from its
receptacle. If the switch or receptacle cannot be quickly located, the suspected electrical device may be
pulled free of the victim. Other persons arriving on the scene must be clearly warned not to touch the
suspected equipment until it is deenergized. Aid should be enlisted to unplug the device as soon as
possible. The injured person should be pulled free of contact with stationary equipment (such as a bus
bar) if the equipment cannot be quickly deenergized, or if considerations of military operation or unit
survival prevent immediate shutdown of the circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">This can be done quickly and safely by carefully applying the following procedures:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Protect yourself with dry insulating material.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Use a dry board, belt, clothing, or other available nonconductive material to free the victim from
electrical contact. DO NOT TOUCH THE VICTIM UNTIL THE SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY
HAS BEEN REMOVED.
</p><p class="paragraph">Once the victim has been removed from the electrical source, it should be determined, if the person
is breathing. If the person is not breathing, a method of artificial ventilation is used.
</p><p class="paragraph">Sometimes victims of electrical shock suffer cardiac arrest (heart stoppage) as well as loss of
breathing. Artificial ventilation alone is not enough in cases where the heart has stopped. A technique
known as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) has been developed to provide aid to a person who has
stopped breathing and suffered a cardiac arrest. Because you most likely will be working in the field of
electricity, the risk of electrical shock is higher than most other Navy occupations. You should, at your
earliest opportunity, learn the technique of CPR.
</p><p class="paragraph">CPR is relatively easy to learn and is taught in courses available from the American Red Cross, some
Navy Medical Departments, and in the Standard First Aid Training Course (NAVEDTRA 12081).</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
