SERIES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) was developed for use by personnel in
many electrical- and electronic-related Navy ratings. Written by, and with the advice of, senior
technicians in these ratings, this series provides beginners with fundamental electrical and electronic
concepts through self-study. The presentation of this series is not oriented to any specific rating structure,
but is divided into modules containing related information organized into traditional paths of instruction.
</p><p class="paragraph">The series is designed to give small amounts of information that can be easily digested before advancing
further into the more complex material. For a student just becoming acquainted with electricity or
electronics, it is highly recommended that the modules be studied in their suggested sequence. While
there is a listing of NEETS by module title, the following brief descriptions give a quick overview of how
the individual modules flow together.
</p><p class="paragraph">Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, introduces the course with a short history
of electricity and electronics and proceeds into the characteristics of matter, energy, and direct current
(dc). It also describes some of the general safety precautions and first-aid procedures that should be

</h2><p class="paragraph">In previous study you have learned that current flows in the conductor of a completed circuit when a
voltage is present. You learned that current and voltage always obey certain laws. In electronics, the laws
still apply. You will use them continuously in working with electronic circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">One basic difference in electronic circuits that will at first seem to violate the basic laws is that
electrons flow across a gap, a break in the circuit in which there appears to be no conductor. A large part
of the field of electronics and the entire field of electron tubes are concerned with the flow and control of
these electrons "across the gap." The following paragraphs will explain this interesting phenomenon.

are not bound to atoms. These free electrons are in continuous motion. The higher the temperature of the
conductor, the more agitated are the free electrons, and the faster they move. A temperature can be</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

They "boil" from the conductor’s surface. The process is similar to steam leaving the surface of boiling
water.
</p><p class="paragraph">Heating a conductor to a temperature sufficiently high causing the conductor to give off electrons is
called THERMIONIC EMISSION. The idea of electrons leaving the surface is shown in figure 1-1.
</p><p class="paragraph">Thomas Edison discovered the principle of thermionic emission as he looked for ways to keep soot
from clouding his incandescent light bulb. Edison placed a metal plate inside his bulb along with the
normal filament. He left a gap, a space, between the filament and the plate. He then placed a battery in
series between the plate and the filament, with the positive side toward the plate and the negative side
toward the filament. This circuit is shown in figure 1-2.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">When Edison connected the filament battery and allowed the filament to heat until it glowed, he
discovered that the ammeter in the filament-plate circuit had deflected and remained deflected. He
reasoned that an electrical current must be flowing in the circuit—EVEN ACROSS THE GAP between
the filament and plate.
</p><p class="paragraph">Edison could not explain exactly what was happening. At that time, he probably knew less about
what makes up an electric circuit than you do now. Because it did not eliminate the soot problem, he did
little with this discovery. However, he did patent the incandescent light bulb and made it available to the
scientific community.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's analyze the circuit in figure 1-2. You probably already have a good idea of how the circuit
works. The heated filament causes electrons to boil from its surface. The battery in the filament-plate
circuit places a POSITIVE charge on the plate (because the plate is connected to the positive side of the
battery). The electrons (negative charge) that boil from the filament are attracted to the positively charged
plate. They continue through the ammeter, the battery, and back to the filament. You can see that electron
flow across the space between filament and plate is actually an application of a basic law you already
know—UNLIKE CHARGES ATTRACT.
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember, Edison's bulb had a vacuum so the filament would glow without burning. Also, the space
between the filament and plate was relatively small. The electrons emitted from the filament did not have
far to go to reach the plate. Thus, the positive charge on the plate was able to attract the negative
electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">The key to this explanation is that the electrons were floating free of the hot filament. It would have
taken hundreds of volts, probably, to move electrons across the space if they had to be forcibly pulled
from a cold filament. Such an action would destroy the filament and the flow would cease.
</p><p class="paragraph">The application of thermionic emission that Edison made in causing electrons to flow across the
space between the filament and the plate has become known as the EDISON EFFECT. It is fairly simple</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

effect. Be sure you have a good understanding of it before you go on.

 Q2. Why do electrons cross the gap in a vacuum tube?
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-DIODE-TUBE-1-4-">THE DIODE TUBE
</h2><p class="paragraph">The diode vacuum tube we are about to study is really Edison’s old incandescent bulb with the plate
in it. Diode means two elements or two electrodes, and refers to the two parts within the glass container
that make up the tube. We have called them filament and plate. More formally, they are called
CATHODE and PLATE, respectively. Sometimes the filament is called a HEATER, for obvious
reasons-more on this later.
</p><p class="paragraph">Within a few years after the discovery of the Edison effect, scientists had learned a great deal more
than Edison knew at the time of his discovery. By the early 1900s, J.J. Thomson in England had
discovered the electron. Marconi, in Italy and England, had demonstrated the wireless, which was to
become the radio. The theoretical knowledge of the nature of electricity and things electrical was
increasing at a rapid rate.
</p><p class="paragraph">J.A. Fleming, an English scientist, was trying to improve on Marconi’s relatively crude wireless
receiver when his mind went back to Edison’s earlier work. His subsequent experiments resulted in what
became known as the FLEMING VALVE (the diode), the first major step on the way to electronics.
OPERATION OF THE DIODE TUBE
</p><p class="paragraph">Before learning about Fleming’s valve, the forerunner of the modern diode, let’s look at Edison’s
original circuit. This time, however, we’ll draw it as a schematic diagram, using the symbol for a diode
instead of a cartoon-like picture. The schematic is shown in figure 1-3.
</p><p class="paragraph">Note that this is really two series circuits. The filament battery and the filament itself form a series
circuit. This circuit is known as the filament circuit.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The path of the second series circuit is from one side of the filament, across the space to the plate,
through the ammeter and battery, then back to the filament. This circuit is known as the plate circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">You will note that a part of the filament circuit is also common to the plate circuit. This part enables
the electrons boiled from the filament to return to the filament. No electron could flow anywhere if this
return path were not completed. The electron flow measured by the ammeter is known as plate current.
</p><p class="paragraph">The voltage applied between the filament and plate is known as plate voltage. You will become
familiar with these terms and with others that are commonly used with diodes and diode circuits as we
progress.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Diode Operation with a Positive Plate
</h3><p class="paragraph">Fleming started with a two-element tube (diode) similar to Edison’s and at first duplicated Edison’s
experiment. The results are worth repeating here. Look at figure 1-3 again.
</p><p class="paragraph">With the plate POSITIVE relative to the filament, the filament hot, and the circuit completed as
shown, the ammeter detected a current flowing in the plate circuit. Because current is the same in all parts
of a series circuit, we know that the same current must flow across the space between filament and plate.
We know now that the electrons boiled from the heated filament are NEGATIVE and are attracted to the
POSITIVE plate because UNLIKE CHARGES ATTRACT.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Diode Operation with a Negative Plate
</h3><p class="paragraph">Fleming’s next step was to use a similar circuit but to reverse the plate battery. The circuit is shown
in figure 1-4.
</p><p class="paragraph">With the plate NEGATIVE relative to the filament, the filament hot, and the circuit completed as
shown, the ammeter indicated that ZERO current was flowing in the plate circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">Fleming found that the NEGATIVE charge on the plate, relative to the filament, CUT OFF the flow
of plate current as effectively as if a VALVE were used to stop the flow of water in a pipe.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">You have all of the facts available that Fleming had. Can you give an explanation of why the diode
cuts off current when the plate is negative?
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s put the facts together. The filament is hot and electrons boil from its surface. Because the
filament is the only heated element in the diode, it is the ONLY source of electrons within the space
between filament and plate. However, because the plate is NEGATIVE and the electrons are
NEGATIVE, the electrons are repelled back to the filament. Remember that LIKE CHARGES REPEL.
If electrons cannot flow across the space, then no electrons can flow anywhere in the plate circuit. The
ammeter therefore indicates ZERO.
</p><p class="paragraph">It might seem to you that electrons flow from the negative plate to the positive filament under these
conditions. This is NOT the case. Remember that it takes a heated element to emit electrons and that the
filament is the only heated element in the diode. The plate is cold. Therefore, electrons cannot leave the
plate, and plate-to-filament current cannot exist.
</p><p class="paragraph">The following is a summary of diode operation as we have covered it to this point:
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume that all parts of the circuit are operable and connected.
</p><p class="paragraph">• PLATE CURRENT FLOWS WHEN THE PLATE IS POSITIVE.
</p><p class="paragraph">• PLATE CURRENT IS CUT OFF WHEN THE PLATE IS NEGATIVE.
</p><p class="paragraph">• PLATE CURRENT FLOWS ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION-FROM THE FILAMENT TO
THE PLATE.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Measuring Diode Voltages
</h3><p class="paragraph">As you know, it is impossible to have a voltage at one point, because voltage is defined as a
DIFFERENCE of POTENTIAL between two points. In our explanation above we referred to plate
voltage. To be exactly right, we should refer to plate voltage as the VOLTAGE BETWEEN PLATE
and FILAMENT. Plate voltages, and others that you will learn about soon, are often referred to as if they
appear at one point. This should not confuse you if you remember your definition of voltage and realize
that voltage is always measured between two points. M1 and M2 in figure 1-5 measure plate voltage and
filament voltage, respectively.

</p><p class="paragraph">The reference point in diode and other tube circuits is usually a common point between the
individual circuits within the tube. The reference point (common) in figure 1-5 is the conductor between
the bottom of the transformer secondary and the negative side of the filament battery. Note that one side
of each voltmeter is connected to this point.
</p><p class="question"> Q3. Name the two series circuits that exist in a diode circuit.
 Q4. Before a diode will conduct, the cathode must be what polarity relative to the plate?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Diode Operation with an Alternating Voltage on the Plate
</h3><p class="paragraph">After experimenting with a positive plate and a negative plate, Fleming replaced the direct voltage of
the battery with an alternating voltage. In our explanation, we’ll use a transformer as the source of
alternating voltage. The circuit is shown in figure 1-5.
</p><p class="paragraph">Note that the only real difference in this circuit from the previous ones is the transformer. The
transformer secondary is connected in series with the plate circuit—where the plate battery was
previously.
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember from your study of transformers that the secondary (output) of a transformer always
produces an alternating voltage. The secondary voltage is a sine wave as shown in the figure.
</p><p class="paragraph">You'll remember that the sine wave is a visual picture, a graph of the change in alternating voltage as
it builds from zero to a maximum value (positive) and then drops to zero again as it decreases to its
minimum value (negative) in the cycle.
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume that the polarity across the secondary during the first half-cycle of the input ac voltage is as
shown in the figure. During this entire first half-cycle period, the plate's polarity will be POSITIVE.
Under this condition, plate current flows, as shown by the ammeter.
</p><p class="paragraph">The plate current will rise and fall because the voltage on the plate is rising and falling. Remember
that current in a given circuit is directly proportional to voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">During the second half-cycle period, plate's polarity will be NEGATIVE. Under this condition, for
this entire period, the diode will not conduct. If our ammeter could respond rapidly, it would drop to zero.
The plate-current waveform (Ip) in figure 1-5 shows zero current during this period.
</p><p class="paragraph">Here is a summary of effects of applying alternating voltage to the plate of the diode:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Diode plate current flows during the positive half-cycle. It changes value as the plate voltage rises
and falls.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The diode cuts off plate current during the entire period of the negative half-cycle.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Diode plate current flows in PULSES because the diode cuts off half the time.
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Diode plate current can flow in only one direction. It is always a direct current. (In this case
PULSATING DC—one that flows in pulses.)
</p><p class="paragraph">5. In effect, the diode has caused an alternating voltage to produce a direct current.
</p><p class="paragraph">The ability to obtain direct current from an ac source is very important and one function of a diode
that you will see again and again wherever you work in electronics.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The circuits that we have discussed up to this point were chosen to show the general concepts
discovered by Edison and Fleming. They are not practical because they do no useful work. For now, only
the concepts are important. Practical circuitry will be presented later in this chapter as you learn specific
points about the construction, limitations, and other characteristics of modern diode tubes.
</p><p class="question"> Q5. An ac voltage is applied across a diode. The tube will conduct when what alternation of ac is
applied to the plate?
</p><p class="question"> Q6. What would be the output of the circuit described in question 5?
DIODE CONSTRUCTION
</p><p class="paragraph">Diode tubes in present use are descendants of Fleming’s valve. There is a family resemblance, but
many changes have been made from the original. Diodes are both smaller and larger, less powerful and
more powerful, and above all, more efficient and more reliable. The search for greater efficiency and
reliability has resulted in many physical changes, a few of which will be covered in the next paragraphs.
</p><p class="paragraph">Most of what is said here about construction and materials will be true of all electron tubes, not just
diodes.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Filaments
</h3><p class="paragraph">Modern filaments in ALL tubes last longer, emit greater amounts of electrons for a given size, and
many operate at a lower temperature than in the early days. Most improvements have resulted from the
use of new materials and from better quality control during manufacture.
</p><p class="paragraph">Three materials that are commonly used as filaments are tungsten, thoriated tungsten, and
oxide-coated metals.
</p><p class="paragraph">Tungsten has great durability but requires large amounts of power for efficient thermionic emission.
Thoriated-tungsten filaments are made of tungsten with a very thin coat of thorium, which makes a much
better emitter of electrons than just tungsten. Oxide-coated filaments are made of metal, such as nickel,
coated with a mixture of barium and strontium oxides. The oxide coat, in turn, is coated with a one-
molecule-thick layer of metal barium and strontium. Oxide coating produces great emission efficiency
and long life at relatively low heat.
</p><p class="paragraph">A major advance in electronics was the elimination of batteries as power sources for tubes. Except in
electronic devices designed to be operated away from the ac power source, alternating current is used to
heat filaments.
</p><p class="paragraph">Voltage may be supplied by a separate filament transformer or it may be taken from a filament
winding that is part of a power transformer. The actual voltage may vary from 1 volt up and depends on
the design of the tube. Common filament voltages are 5.0, 6.3, and 12.6 volts ac. Filaments may be
connected in series with other tube filaments or may be in parallel with each other. This is determined by
the equipment designer.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Cathodes
</h3><p class="paragraph">As was mentioned previously, a more formal name for the electron-emitting element in a tube is the
CATHODE.
</p><p class="paragraph">Cathodes in all tubes, not just diodes, are of two general types, either directly heated or indirectly
heated. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">DIRECTLY HEATED.—The filament that has been discussed so far is the directly heated cathode.
Directly heated cathodes are fairly efficient and are capable of emitting large amounts of electrons. Figure
1-6 shows this type and its schematic symbol.
</p><p class="paragraph">An added advantage of this type of filament is the rapidity with which it reaches electron-emitting
temperature. Because this is almost instantaneous, many pieces of electronic equipment that must be
turned on at infrequent intervals and be instantly usable have directly heated cathode tubes.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are disadvantages. Because of its construction, parts of the filament are closer to the plate than
other parts. This results in unequal emission and a loss of efficiency. Another disadvantage occurs when
dc is used to heat a filament. The filament represents a resistance. When current flows through this
resistance, a voltage drop occurs. The result is that one side of the resistance, or filament, is more negative
than the other side. The negative side of the filament will emit more electrons than the positive side;
which, again, is less efficient than if the filament has equal emission across its entire surface.
</p><p class="paragraph">When ac is the source of filament power, it causes a small increase and decrease of temperature as it
rises and falls. This causes a small increase and decrease of emitted electrons. This effect is not too
important in many diode circuits, but it is undesirable in other tube circuits.
</p><p class="paragraph">INDIRECTLY HEATED.—Figure 1-7 shows this type of cathode and its schematic symbol.
Indirectly heated cathodes are always composed of oxide-coated material. The cathode is a cylinder, a
kind of sleeve, that encloses the twisted wire filament. The only function of the filament is to heat the
cathode. The filament is often called a heater when used in this manner.

</p><p class="paragraph">Some schematics do not show heaters and heater connections. Heaters, of course, are still present in
the tubes, but their appearance in a schematic adds little to understanding the circuit. The heater is not
considered to be an active element. For example, a tube with an indirectly heated cathode and a plate is
still called a diode, even though it might seem that there are three elements in the tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because indirectly heated cathodes are relatively large, they take longer to heat to electron-emitting
temperature. Once up to temperature, however, they do not respond to the small variations in heater
temperature caused by ac fluctuations. Because of the inherent advantages, most tubes in use today have
indirectly heated cathodes.
</p><p class="question"> Q7. Besides tungsten, what other materials are used for cathodes in vacuum tubes?
 Q8. What is the advantage of directly heated cathodes?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Plates
</h3><p class="paragraph">Edison’s plate was just that-a plate, a flat piece of metal. Plates are no longer flat but are designed in
many different shapes. Figure 1-8 shows two diodes, one with a directly heated cathode, the other with an
indirectly heated cathode. Each plate is cut away to show the internal position of elements and the plate
shapes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Plates must be able to hold up under the stress of heat created by the flow of plate currents and the
closeness of hot cathodes. They need to be strong enough to withstand mechanical shocks produced by
vibration and handling.
</p><p class="paragraph">Some typical materials used for electron tube plates are tungsten, molybdenum, graphite, nickel,
tantalum, and copper.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Tube Bases
</h3><p class="paragraph">The base shown in figure 1-9 has two functions. First, it serves as the mounting for tube elements.
Second, it serves as the terminal points for the electrical connections to the tube elements. This is
accomplished by molding or otherwise bringing pins (or prongs) through the base. The internal ends of
these pins are connected to tube elements. The pins themselves are male connections.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The base must be mechanically strong and made of an insulating material to prevent the tube
elements from shorting.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because they require relatively frequent replacement, most tubes are designed to plug into sockets
permanently mounted in the equipment. Tube pins and sockets are so designed that tubes cannot be
plugged in incorrectly.
</p><p class="paragraph">Tube sockets must make secure mechanical and electrical contact with tube pins, must insulate pins
from each other, and must provide terminals to which circuit components and conductors are connected.
</p><p class="paragraph">Each element of a tube is connected to a pin in its base. To trace a circuit easily and efficiently, you
must match elements with their pin numbers. This information is available in tube manuals and
equipment schematics. Figure 1-10 shows these numbers on one example of a diode symbol. You will
also note the designation V1 beside the tube. Electron tubes are often identified in schematic diagrams by
the letter V and a number.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The plate voltage-plate current characteristic for a given diode is a measure of exactly how much plate
voltage controls how much plate current. This is often called the Ep - Ip characteristic.
</p><p class="paragraph">The Ep - Ip characteristic for a given diode, is determined by design engineers using mathematical
analysis and laboratory experiment. You, as a technician, will never need to do this. However, you will
use the results obtained by the engineers. You will also use your knowledge of the diode as you analyze
equipment malfunction.
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume that we have the circuit in figure 1-12. (The filament has the proper voltage-even though it
isn’t shown on the diagram.) Our purpose is to determine just how a changing voltage on the plate
changes (or controls) the plate current. The method is as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Starting with zero volts from our variable dc voltage source, increase the plate voltage (Ep) in
steps of 50 volts until you reach 400 volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. At a each 50-volt step, measure the milliamperes of plate current (Ip) that flow through the meter.
Record the Ip meter readings, step by step, so that you may analyze the results.
</p><p class="paragraph">Assume that table 1-2 shows our results. While we could use the table, a more normal procedure is to
plot a graph of the values. Such a graph is called an Ep - Ip CURVE and is shown in figure 1-13. Each
tube has its own Ep - Ip curve, which is available in commercial tube manuals and in many equipment
technical manuals. Each curve will be different in some respects from every other curve. The shapes,
however, will be similar.

</p></div></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-15
</p><p class="paragraph">The Ep - Ip curve in figure 1-13, although just an example, is typical of real plate characteristic
curves. You may learn certain characteristics that apply to both diodes and other tubes by studying it.
</p><p class="paragraph">First, look at the part of the curve to the left of point A. Because it is not a straight line, it is referred
to as NONLINEAR. Note that a change of 150 volts (0-150) caused a change of 10 mA of plate current
(0-10). In comparison with the straight-line part of the curve, between points A and B, this is a relatively
small change in current. The smaller the change in current, the flatter the curve.
</p><p class="paragraph">In explaining this NONLINEAR portion of the curve, let’s go back just a bit to electron emission.
The electrons emitted by a cathode form a cloud around the cathode. This cloud is called the SPACE
CHARGE. The closer the space charge is to the cathode, the more densely packed it is with electrons. In
our example, the lower plate voltages (0-150 volts) over this part of the curve exert a pull on only the
outer fringe of the space charge where there are few electrons. This results in relatively few electrons
flowing to the plate.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now look at the center portion of the curve between A and B. This is known as the LINEAR portion
because it is nearly a STRAIGHT LINE. Over this portion, a change of 50 volts Ep causes a change of
10 mA Ip.
</p><p class="paragraph">The reason for the increased change in plate current for a given change of plate voltage also has to do
with the space charge. With a higher plate voltage (over 150 volts), the attraction from the plate begins to
influence the DENSER part of the space charge that has greater numbers of electrons. Therefore, a higher
current flows for a given voltage than in the nonlinear part. The curve becomes steeper. In our example,
this linearity continues to about 300 volts, point B.
</p><p class="paragraph">Lastly, let’s look at the top portion of the curve. The plate current plotted here is produced by the
higher plate voltages. However, the amount of current change for a given voltage change is greatly
reduced. The reason for this again involves the space charge. At about 300 volts, almost all of the
electrons in the space charge are flowing to the plate. A higher voltage cannot attract more electrons
because the cathode cannot produce any more. The point where all (or almost all) available electrons are
being drawn to the plate is called PLATE SATURATION or just SATURATION. This is one of the
limiting factors of every tube.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">You can see from the analysis that the most consistent control of plate current takes place over the
linear portion of the Ep - Ip curve. In most applications, electron tubes are operated in this linear portion of
the characteristic curve.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Plate Resistance (Rp)
One tube parameter that can be calculated from values on the Ep - Ip curve is known as plate
</h3><p class="paragraph">resistance, abbreviated as Rp. In a properly designed electron tube, there is no physical resistor between
cathode and plate; that is, the electrons do not pass through a resistor in arriving at the plate. You may
have wondered, however, why the variable dc voltage source of figure 1-12 didn’t blow a fuse. Doesn’t
the plate circuit appear to be a short circuit-a circuit without a load to limit the current?
</p><p class="paragraph">The fact is, there is a very real, effective RESISTANCE between cathode and plate. It is not lumped
in a resistor, but the circuit may be analyzed as if it is. The plate resistance of a given tube, Rp, can be
calculated by applying Ohm’s law to the values of Ep and Ip. Figure 1-14 is a typical diode Ep - Ip curve.
The plate resistance has been figured for Rp under three different conditions, as follows:
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember that 1 mA = .001 ampere; therefore 40 mA =.040 ampere.

PLATE RESISTANCE IN GAS DIODES.—Gas diodes are a type of tube that we have not yet
</p><p class="paragraph">discussed. They are mentioned here only because of their plate-resistance characteristic.
</p><p class="paragraph">Instead of a high-vacuum environment, some tubes have small amounts of gas introduced in the
envelope vacuum during manufacture. Argon, neon, helium, or mercury vapor are commonly used.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a certain minimum voltage is placed on the plate, the gas molecules in the envelope ionize.
This happens by a process that will be explained when gas diodes are studied. The positive ions tend to
cancel some of the effects of the space charge that influence plate resistance in a vacuum tube. This
canceling reduces internal plate resistance to a relatively low, constant value. In applications that require a
large plate current, the low plate resistance of a gas-filled diode has an efficiency that cannot be
approached by a high-vacuum diode.
</p><p class="paragraph">This and other characteristics of gas tubes will be covered later.
</p><p class="question"> Q10. Vacuum tubes are designed to operate in what portion of the Ep - Ip curve?
 Q11. What value can be calculated from the values found on an Ep - Ip curve?
</p><h3 class="subsection">Plate Dissipation
</h3><p class="paragraph">When electrons are attracted from the space charge to the plate, they are accelerated by the
attraction. Their gain in speed gives them energy that causes them to strike the plate with a considerable
force. As the electrons strike the plate, this energy is converted to heat. The plate must be able to
withstand the associated increase in temperature. The maximum amount of power (watts) that a given
plate can safely dissipate (as heat) is called the PLATE DISSIPATION rating.
</p><p class="paragraph">To find the amount of plate dissipation for a given tube under a particular set of plate conditions, use
the following equation:
</p><p class="paragraph">This is a relatively small wattage. It's probable that the plate of our example diode is not overheating.
A tube manual could tell us for sure.
</p><p class="paragraph">Plate dissipation is a circuit loss that must be made good by the power source in a circuit. In our
example, this is the plate voltage supply.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">Peak Current Rating
</h3><p class="paragraph">The maximum instantaneous current that a tube can pass in the normal direction (cathode to plate)
without damage is called the PEAK CURRENT RATING. Peak current rating is determined by the
amount of electrons available from the cathode and the length of time plate current flows.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Peak Voltage Rating
</h3><p class="paragraph">This is the maximum instantaneous voltage that can be applied to a tube in the normal direction
without a breakdown.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Peak Inverse Voltage Rating
</h3><p class="paragraph">This is the maximum voltage that can be applied to a tube in the reverse direction (plate negative
with respect to the cathode)-exceeding this will cause arc-over from the plate to the cathode and will
damage the tube. PIV, as this is sometimes abbreviated, becomes very important in the rectifier circuit to
be discussed as a later major subject.
Transit Time
</p><p class="paragraph">Things that happen in electricity and electronics are often explained as if they happen
instantaneously. As fast as electricity acts, however, the truth is that cause and effect are separated by a
certain amount of time.
</p><p class="paragraph">Each tube has a factor called TRANSIT TIME, which is the time required for an individual electron
to move from the cathode to the plate. In certain applications involving high-frequency voltages, transit
time places a limitation on tubes. We will explain this limitation when we discuss the circuits it affects.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Summary of Diode Parameters and Limitations
</h3><p class="paragraph">You should now have a basic understanding of diodes, many of their characteristics, and some of
their limitations. One of the more important concepts that you should now understand is that most of
these characteristics influence each other. For example, practically all plate characteristics are
interrelated. Change one and the others change. Another example is heater voltage. Every tube parameter
affected by the cathode depends on proper heater voltage. Interrelationships such as these make
electronics both fascinating and, at times, frustrating.
</p><p class="paragraph">Many of the limiting factors that we have discussed are the same ones found in other electrical
devices such as motors, stoves, toasters, and so on. Heating and overheating, insulation breakdown, and
excessive voltage and current are all limitations that you have noted before.
</p><p class="paragraph">The point is that you can and should apply just about everything you have learned about electricity to
electron tubes. Little is new except the environment.

applied to the cathode. If the tube conducts, what tube parameter has been exceeded?

</p><p class="paragraph">applications in other NEETS modules and later will see the diode in several pieces of electronic
equipment.
</p><p class="paragraph">As with all inventions, Fleming’s diode was immediately the subject of much experimentation and
many attempts at improvement. An American experimenter, Dr. Lee De Forest, added another active
element to the diode in 1906. He was trying to improve the radio application of Fleming’s diode. His new
tube was eventually called a triode.
</p><p class="paragraph">DeForest’s triode was not very successful as a radio "detector." (Detectors will be studied in a later
NEETS module.) However, in 1912, De Forest discovered that his original triode could AMPLIFY or
magnify very weak electrical impulses. It is because of the triode’s ability to amplify that De Forest is
honored as one of the great radio pioneers.
</p><p class="paragraph">The immediate application of the triode amplifier was in telephone and radio. Both fields were
limited because electrical impulses (signals) became weaker and weaker as the distance from the signal
source increased. The triode, along with other developments of the time, made long-distance
communications possible. Looking back, we can now see that the amplifying tube was the real beginning
of modern electronics and influenced everything that followed. Let’s find out more about the idea of
amplification and how it is done in the triode.
</p><p class="paragraph">You are already familiar with a type of amplification. In a previous NEETS module, step-up
transformers were discussed. You should remember that an input voltage applied to the primary of a step-
up transformer is increased in amplitude at the secondary by a factor determined by the step-up turns
ratio.
</p><p class="paragraph">For example, if 5 volts were applied to the primary of a 1:3 step-up transformer, the secondary would
produce 15 volts. In other words, the input voltage was amplified by a factor of 3. When applied to
electronic circuits, these primary and secondary voltages are more often called signals, or input and
output signal, respectively. In electronics, the amplitude of an input signal must sometimes be increased
many times-often, hundreds or thousands of times!
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of size and design limitations, transformers are usually not practical for use in electronics as
amplifiers.
</p><p class="paragraph">DeForest’s first experiment with the diode was to place an additional metal plate between the cathode
and plate. He then placed an ac signal on the metal plate. When the circuit was energized, De Forest
found that the ammeter stayed on zero regardless of the polarity of the input signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">What was happening was that the new element was blocking (or shadowing) the plate. Any electrons
attempting to reach the plate from the cathode would hit the new element instead. As the circuit didn’t
work, it was back to the drawing board.
</p><p class="paragraph">In his next attempt, De Forest decided to change the element between the cathode and the plate.
Instead of a solid metal plate, he used a wire mesh. This would allow electrons to flow from the cathode,
THROUGH THE WIRE MESH, to the plate. This tube circuit is shown in figure 1-15. In view (A) you
see De Forest’s circuit with 0 volts applied to the third element, (today called a control grid or
occasionally just the grid). Under these conditions, assume that the ammeter reads 5 milliamperes. With
no voltage applied to the grid, the grid has little effect on the electron stream. For all practical purposes,
the control grid is not there. Most electrons flow through the open mesh. The tube functions as a diode.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In view (B), you see De Forest’s tube with +3 volts applied to the control grid. When De Forest
applied this voltage, he found that plate current, Ip, increased by a large amount. (We’ll say it doubled to
simplify the explanation.) You already know that the only way to double the plate current in a diode is to
increase the plate voltage by a large amount. Yet, De Forest had doubled plate current by applying only 3
volts positive to the control grid!
</p><p class="paragraph">The reason for this is fairly easy to understand. It’s the old principle of "opposites attract." When the
control grid was made positive, electrons surrounding the cathode (negative charges) were attracted to the
grid. But remember, the grid is a metal mesh. Most of the electrons, instead of striking the grid wires,
were propelled through the holes in the mesh. Once they had passed the grid, they were attracted to the
positive charge in the plate.
</p><p class="paragraph">You might wonder why the grid would make that much difference. After all, the plate has 300 volts
on it, while the grid only has 3 volts on it. Surely the plate would have a greater effect on current flow
than a grid with only one one-hundredth the attractive potential of the plate. But remember, in your study
of capacitors you discovered that opposites attract because of electrostatic lines of force, and that the
strength of electrostatic lines of force decreased with distance. In his tube, DeForest had placed the grid
very close to the cathode. Therefore, it had a greater effect on current flow from the cathode than did the
plate, which was placed at a much greater distance from the cathode. For this reason, De Forest was able
to double the current flow through the tube with only +3 volts applied to the grid.
</p><p class="paragraph">DeForest had certainly hit on something. Now the problem was to find out what would happen when
a negative potential was applied to the grid. This is shown in view (C) of figure 1-15. When De Forest
applied -3 volts to the grid, he found that plate current decreased to half of what it was when the grid had
no voltage applied. The reason for this is found in the principle of "likes repel." The negatively charged
grid simply repelled some of the electrons back toward the cathode. In this manner, the attractive effect of
the plate was decreased, and less current flowed to the plate.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now De Forest was getting somewhere. Using his new tube (which he called a triode because it had
3 elements in it), he was able to control relatively large changes of current with very small voltages. But!
was it amplification? Remember, amplification is the process of taking a small signal and increasing its
amplitude. In De Forest’s circuit, the small input signal was 3 volts dc. What De Forest got for an output</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

"conversion," or in other words, converted a signal voltage to a current variation. This wasn’t exactly what
he had in mind. As it stood, the circuit wasn’t very useful. Obviously, something was needed. After
examining the circuit, De Forest discovered the answer—Ohm's law. Remember E = I × R? De Forest
wanted a voltage change, not a current change. The answer was simple:
</p><p class="paragraph">In other words, run the plate current variation (caused by the voltage on the grid) through a resistor,
and cause a varying voltage drop across the resistor. This is shown in figure 1-16.
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit is identical to the one in figure 1-15 except that now a resistor (called a plate-load
resistor, RL) has been added to the plate circuit, and a voltmeter has been added to measure the voltage
drop across RL.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view (A) of figure 1-16, the control grid is at 0 volts. Once again 5 milliamperes flow in the plate
circuit. Now, the 5 milliamperes must flow through RL. The voltage drop is equal to:
</p><h3 class="subsection">E = I × R

grid. In view (B) of the figure, +3 volts is applied to the control grid. Once again plate current increases to
10 milliamperes. The voltage drop across RL  is</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

again plate current decreases to 2.5 milliamperes, and the voltage drop across RL drops to 25 volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">We have caused the voltage across RL to vary by varying the grid voltage; but is it amplification?
Well, let's take a look at it. The grid voltage, or input signal, varies from +3 to -3 volts, or 6 volts. The
voltage drop across RL varies from 25 volts to 100 volts, or 75 volts. In other words, the triode has caused

</p><p class="paragraph">• A relatively small change in voltage on the grid causes a relatively large change in plate current.
</p><p class="paragraph">• By adding a plate-load resistor in series with the plate circuit, the changing plate current causes a
changing voltage drop in the plate circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Therefore, the small voltage change on the grid causes a large change of voltage in the plate
circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">• By this process, the small input signal on the grid has been amplified to a large output signal
voltage in the plate circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">We'll leave De Forest at this point. He showed that the control grid can, in fact, CONTROL plate
current. He also showed that the changing plate current can create a changing plate voltage. To some
degree, his changing voltages and currents also changed the world.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-INTRODUCTION-TO-GRID-BIAS-1-22-">INTRODUCTION TO GRID BIAS
</h2><p class="paragraph">We purposely left out several features of practical triode circuits from the circuits we just discussed.
We did so to present the idea of grid control more simply. One of these features is grid bias.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's take another look at the circuit in figure 1-15(B). We found that the positive charge on the grid
caused more plate current to flow. However, when the grid becomes positive, it begins to act like a small
plate. It draws a few electrons from the space charge. These electrons flow from the cathode across the
gap to the positive grid, and back through the external grid circuit to the cathode. This flow is known as
grid current. In some tube applications, grid current is desired. In others it is relatively harmless, while in
some, grid current causes problems and must be eliminated.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Most amplifier circuits are designed to operate with the grid NEGATIVE relative to the cathode.
The voltage that causes this is called a BIAS VOLTAGE. The symbol for the bias supply is Ecc. One
effect of bias (there are several other very important ones) is to reduce or eliminate grid current. Let’s see
how it works.
</p><p class="paragraph">GRID BIAS is a steady, direct voltage that is placed at some point in the external circuit between the
grid and the cathode. It may be in the cathode leg or the grid leg as shown in figure 1-17. It is always in
series with the input signal voltage. In each of the circuits in figure 1-17, Ecc makes the grid negative with
respect to the cathode because of the negative terminal being connected toward the grid and the positive
terminal being connected toward the cathode. With identical components, each circuit would provide the
same bias.
</p><p class="paragraph">Battery bias is practically never used in modern circuits. Because of its simplicity, however, we will
use it in analyzing the effects of bias. We will present other, more practical methods later.
</p><p class="paragraph">Let’s assume that the bias voltage in figure 1-17 is -6 volts. Let’s also assume that the peak-to-peak
signal voltage from the transformer is 6 volts. Each of these voltage waveforms is shown in figure 1-18.
From past experience you know that voltages in series ADD. Figure 1-18 has a table of the instantaneous
values of the two voltages added together. The waveforms are drawn from these values.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Because the bias voltage is more negative than the signal voltage is positive, the resultant voltage
(bias plus signal), Eg, is ALWAYS negative. The signal, in this case, makes the grid voltage go either
MORE or LESS NEGATIVE, (-9 to -3) but cannot drive it positive.
</p><p class="paragraph">Under these circumstances, the negative grid always repels electrons from the space charge. The grid
cannot draw current. Any problems associated with grid current are eliminated, because grid current
cannot flow to a negative grid.
</p><p class="paragraph">You have probably already realized that the negative bias also reduces plate current flow. (Negative
charge on grid-less plate current, right?) The trick here is for the circuit designer to choose a bias and an
input signal that, when added together, do not allow the grid to become positive nor to become negative
enough to stop plate current.

OPERATION OF THE TRIODE
</p><p class="paragraph">The circuit in figure 1-19 brings together all of the essential components of a triode amplifier. Before
analyzing the circuit, however, we need to define the term QUIESCENT.
</p><p class="paragraph">The term quiescent identifies the condition of a circuit with NO INPUT SIGNAL applied. With a
given tube, bias supply, and plate supply, an exact amount of plate current will flow with no signal on the
grid. This amount is known as the quiescent value of plate current. The quiescent value of plate voltage is
the voltage between cathode and plate when quiescent current flows.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Simply, quiescent describes circuit conditions when the tube is not amplifying. The tube has no
output signal and is in a kind of standby, waiting condition. Now let’s go on to figure 1-19. With no input
signal, under quiescent conditions, assume that 1 milliampere of current flows through the tube, cathode
to plate. This current (Ip) will flow through RL (load resistor) to the positive terminal of the battery. The
current flowing through RL  causes a voltage drop (IR) across RL equal to:
</p><p class="paragraph">Subtracting the voltage dropped across the plate-load resistor from the source voltage of 300 volts
gives you 200 volts (300 volts - 100 volts). Thus, the plate voltage (Ep) is at 200 volts. The quiescent
conditions for the circuit are:
</p><p class="paragraph">These values are shown on the waveforms as time a in figure 1-19.
</p><p class="paragraph">You should notice that even though the grid is more negative (-6 volts) than the cathode, the tube in
the circuit is still conducting, but not as heavily as it would if the grid were at zero volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now look at the input signal from the transformer secondary. For ease of explanation, we will
consider only three points of the ac sine wave input: point b, the maximum negative excursion; point c,
the maximum positive excursion; and point d, the zero reference or null point of the signal. At time b, the
input signal at the grid will be at its most negative value (-3 volts). This will cause the grid to go to -9
volts (-6 volts + -3 volts). This is shown at time b on the grid voltage waveform. The increased negative
voltage on the control grid will decrease the electrostatic attraction between the plate and the cathode.
Conduction through the tube (Ip) will decrease. Assume that it drops to .5 milliamperes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The decrease in plate current will cause the voltage drop across the plate-load resistor (RL) to also
decrease from 100 volts, as explained by Ohm’s law:
</p><p class="paragraph">Plate voltage will then rise +250 volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">This is shown on the output signal waveform at time b.
</p><p class="paragraph">At time c, the input has reached its maximum positive value of +3 volts. This will decrease grid
voltage to -3 volts (-6 volts + 3 volts). This is shown on the grid voltage waveform at time c. This in turn
will increase the electrostatic force between the plate and cathode. More electrons will then flow from the</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

milliamperes. This will cause plate voltage (Eb) to decrease to 150 volts as shown below.
</p><p class="paragraph">This is shown on the output waveform at time c.
</p><p class="paragraph">At time d, the input signal voltage decreases back to zero volts. The grid will return to the quiescent
state of -6 volts, and conduction through the tube will again be at 1 milliampere. The plate will return to
its quiescent voltage of +200 volts (shown at time d on the output waveform).
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see, varying the grid by only 6 volts has caused the output of the triode to vary by 100
volts. The input signal voltage has been amplified (or increased) by a factor of 16.6. This factor is an
expression of amplifier VOLTAGE GAIN and is calculated by dividing the output signal voltage by the
input signal voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before going on to the next section, there is one more thing of which you should be aware. Look
again at the waveforms of figure 1-19. Notice that the output voltage of the amplifier is 180º out of phase
with the input voltage. You will find that this polarity inversion is a characteristic of any amplifier in
which the output is taken between the cathode and the plate. This is normal and should not confuse you
when you troubleshoot or work with this type of circuit.

</h2><p class="paragraph">The triode circuit you have just studied is a fairly simple affair. In actual application, triode circuits
are a bit more complex. There are two reasons for this. The first has to do with the triodes ability to
amplify and perform other functions. Triodes come in many different types. Each of these types has
different internal characteristics and different capabilities. Because of this, each triode circuit must be
designed to accommodate the triodes special characteristics. The second reason for the increase in</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">complexity has to do with DISTORTION. Distortion occurs in a tube circuit any time the output
waveform is not a faithful reproduction of the input waveform.
</p><p class="paragraph">Polarity inversion and voltage gain of the output waveform are not included in this definition of
distortion. Some circuits are designed to distort the output. The reason and methods for this deliberate
distortion will be covered in a later NEETS module. For the most part, however, we desire that circuits
eliminate or reduce distortion.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because the grid is close to the cathode, small changes in grid voltage have large effects on the
conduction of triodes. If a large enough input signal is placed on the grid, a triode may be driven into
either plate-current cutoff or plate-current saturation. When this occurs, the tube is said to be
OVERDRIVEN. Overdriving is considered to be a form of DISTORTION.
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at time zero (0) in the waveforms of figure 1-20. The input signal (Ein) is at zero volts. Grid
voltage equals the bias voltage (-6 volts), and one milliampere of current is flowing through the tube
(quiescent state). Plate voltage (Ep) is 200 volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">On the negative half of the input signal, the grid voltage is made more negative. This reduces plate
current which, in turn, reduces the voltage drop across RL. The voltage between cathode and the plate is
thereby increased. You can see these relationships by following time "a" through the three waveforms.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
<div class="page mainpage" id="40"><div class="centered">

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">1-29
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, let’s assume that this particular triode cuts plate current flow off when the grid reaches -24
volts. This point is reached at time b when Ein is -18 and the bias is -6 (-18 and -6 = -24). Plate current
remains cut off for as long as the grid is at -24 volts or greater.
</p><p class="paragraph">With zero current flowing in the plate circuit, there is no voltage drop across RL. The entire plate-
supply voltage, Ebb (300 volts), appears as plate voltage between the cathode and the plate. This is shown
at time b in the output signal waveform. Between time b and time c, the grid voltage is greater than -24
volts. The plate current remains cutoff, and the plate voltage remains at +300. The output waveform
between time b and time c cannot follow the input because the plate voltage cannot increase above +300
volts. The output waveform is "flattopped." This condition is known as AMPLITUDE DISTORTION.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the grid voltage becomes less negative than -24 volts, after time c, the tube starts conducting,
and the circuit again produces an output.
</p><p class="paragraph">Between time c and time d, the circuit continues to operate without distortion. At time e, however,
the output waveform is again distorted and remains distorted until time f. Let’s see what happened.
</p><p class="paragraph">Remember that every cathode is able to emit just so many electrons. When that maximum number is
being emitted, the tube is said to be at SATURATION or PLATE SATURATION. Saturation is reached
in a triode when the voltages on the grid and plate combine to draw all the electrons from the space
charge.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, as our grid becomes less negative (between time c and time d), and actually becomes positive
(between time d and time e), the plate current increases, the voltage across RL increases, and the plate
voltage decreases.
</p><p class="paragraph">Apparently when the grid voltage reached +12 volts at time e, the plate current reached saturation.
Maximum plate current (at saturation) results in maximum voltage across RL and minimum plate voltage.
Any grid voltage higher than +12 volts cannot cause further changes in the output. Therefore, between
time e and time f, the plate voltage remains at +100 volts and the waveform is distorted. This is also
AMPLITUDE DISTORTION.
</p><p class="paragraph">This has been an explanation of one cycle of an input signal that overdrives the tube. You should
notice that, using the same circuit, a 50-volt peak-to-peak input signal caused a vastly different output
from that caused by the 6-volt peak-to-peak input signal. The 6-volt peak-to-peak signal did not overdrive
the tube. When the input signal was increased to 50-volts peak-to-peak, the tube was forced into cutoff
when the grid was driven to -24 volts, and into saturation when the grid was driven to +12 volts (the grid
voltage plus the signal voltage.) During these periods, the tube could not respond to the input signal. In
other words, the output was distorted. A method commonly used to partially overcome distortion is to
vary the bias voltage on the grid. The point at which the tube goes into cutoff or saturation can then be
controlled.
</p><p class="paragraph">For this reason tube biasing is of great importance in most tube circuits.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TYPES-OF-BIASING-1-30-">TYPES OF BIASING
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are two main classes of biasing—FIXED and SELF. In a tube circuit that uses fixed bias, the
grid-bias voltage is supplied from a power source external to the circuit. You are already familiar with
battery bias, which is one form of fixed bias. When fixed bias is used in a circuit, it can be represented as
either a battery (fig. 1-21, view A), or as a conductor connected to -Ecc (fig. 1-21, view B). Fixed bias is
rarely used in electronics today. Therefore, we will not discuss it further.
</p><p class="paragraph">In circuits using self-bias, the bias voltage is developed across a resistor in the cathode or grid circuit
by tube current. There are two main methods of self-bias: cathode biasing and grid-leak biasing.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Cathode Bias
</h3><p class="paragraph">In circuits using cathode bias, the cathode is made to go positive relative to the grid. The effect of
this is the same as making the grid negative relative to the cathode. Because the biasing resistor is in the
cathode leg of the circuit, the method is called CATHODE BIASING or CATHODE BIAS. A triode
circuit using cathode bias is shown in figure 1-22.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The only difference between the illustrated circuit and the one used to demonstrate triode operation
is the elimination of the battery, Ecc, and the addition of circuit components Rk, the cathode-biasing
resistor; Ck, the cathode ac-bypass capacitor; and a grid resistor (whose purpose will be explained later).
</p><p class="paragraph">When the tube conducts, current flows from the battery through Rk to the cathode, through the tube
to the plate, and through RL to the positive terminal of the battery. The current flowing through Rk will
cause a voltage drop across Rk. The bottom of Rk goes negative while the top goes positive. This positive
voltage at the top of Rk makes the cathode positive relative to the grid.
</p><p class="paragraph">You may wonder what purpose Ck serves in this circuit. Ck serves as an AC BYPASS. Without Ck,
the bias voltage will vary with ac input signals. This is particularly troublesome in the higher frequencies
like those found in radio receivers. Rk, the cathode-biasing resistor, is used to develop the biasing voltage
on the cathode.
</p><p class="paragraph">The input signal will be developed across Rg. You will read more about the circuit component later
in this chapter. Cathode-biasing voltage is developed in the following manner.
</p><p class="paragraph">As we mentioned earlier, the bias voltage will vary with the input unless Ck, the cathode bypass
capacitor, is used.
</p><p class="paragraph">To understand how the bias voltage will vary with an ac input signal, disregard Ck for the moment
and refer to figure 1-22 again.
</p><p class="paragraph">Notice that under quiescent conditions, the voltage drop at the top of Rk is +10 volts. Now let’s apply
the positive-going signal illustrated to the left of the tube. When the positive signal is applied, conduction
through the tube will increase. The only trouble is that current through Rk will also increase. This will
increase the voltage drop across Rk, and the cathode voltage will now be greater than +10 volts.
Remember, at this time the plate is going negative due to increased conduction through the tube. The
combination of the negative-going plate and the positive-going cathode will decrease the electrostatic
attraction across the tube and lower the conduction of the tube. This will reduce the gain of the tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the negative-going signal is applied, conduction through the tube decreases. Current through
Rk decreases and the voltage drop across Rk decreases. This causes the cathode to go more negative,
which tends to increase conduction through the tube. A negative-going signal is amplified by decreasing
plate current and allowing the plate to go positive (remember the 180º inversion.) Thus, increasing</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">conduction on the negative half-cycle decreases the gain of that half-cycle. The overall effect of allowing
cathode biasing to follow the input signal is to decrease the gain of the circuit with ac inputs.
</p><p class="paragraph">This problem can be overcome by installing Ck. The purpose of Ck is to maintain the cathode bias
voltage at a constant level. In common usage, the action of Ck is referred to as "bypassing the ac signal to
ground."
</p><p class="paragraph">The action of Ck will be explained using figure 1-23. View A shows the circuit under quiescent
conditions.  With some conduction through the tube, the cathode and the tops of R
</p><p class="paragraph"> k and Ck are at +10
volts.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view B, the positive-going signal is applied to the grid. This causes increased conduction through
the tube, which attempts to drive the cathode to +20 volts. But notice that the top of Ck is still at +10 volts
(remember capacitors oppose a change in voltage). The top plate of Ck is, in effect, 10 volts negative in
relation to the top of Rk. The only way that Ck can follow the signal on the top of Rk (+20 volts) is to
charge through the tube back to the source, from the source to the lower plate of Ck. When Ck charges
through the tube, it acts as the source of current for the cathode. This causes the cathode to remain at +10
volts while the capacitor is charging.
</p><p class="paragraph">View C of the figure shows the same signal. Under these conditions, conduction through Rk will
decrease. This will cause a decrease in current flow through Rk. Decreased current means decreased
voltage drop. The top of Rk will try to go to +5 volts. Ck must now go more negative to follow the top of
Rk. To do this, current must flow from Ck  through Rk,  to the top plate of Ck. This discharging of Ck will
increase current flow through Rk and increase the voltage drop across Rk, forcing the top to go more
positive. Remember, the voltage drop is due to current flow through the resistor. (The resistor could care
less if the current is caused by conduction or capacitor action.) Thus, the cathode stays at +10 volts
throughout the capacitor-charge cycle.
</p><p class="paragraph">There is one point that we should make. Ck and Rk are in parallel. You learned from previous study
that voltage in a parallel circuit is constant. Thus, it would seem impossible to have the top of Rk at one
voltage while the top plate of Ck is at another. Remember, in electronics nothing happens instantaneously.
There is always some time lag that may be measured in millionths or billionths of seconds. The action of
Ck and Rk that was just described takes place within this time lag. To clarify the explanation, the voltages
used at the components Rk and Ck were exaggerated. Long before a 10-volt differential could exist
between the tops of Rk  and Ck, Ck will act to eliminate this voltage differential.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The capacitor, then, can be said to regulate the current flow through the bias resistor. This action is
considered as BYPASSING  or eliminating the effect of the ac input signal in the cathode. For all
practical purposes, you can assume that ac flows through the capacitor to ground. But, remember, ac only
appears to flow across a capacitor. In reality the ac signal is shunted around the capacitor.
</p><p class="paragraph">There are two disadvantages associated with cathode biasing. To maintain bias voltage continuously,
current must flow through the tube, and plate voltage will never be able to reach the maximum value of
the source voltage. This, in turn, limits the maximum positive output for a negative input signal
(remember the 180º inversion). In addition, maximum plate voltage is decreased by the amount of
cathode-biasing voltage. What this means is that you can't get something for nothing. If the cathode is
biased at +20 volts, this voltage must be subtracted from the plate voltage. As an example, consider a
triode with a 10,000 ohm plate resistor and a +300 volts dc source voltage. If a current of 2 milliamperes
flows through the tube under quiescent conditions, 20 volts are dropped across the plate-load resistor. The
maximum plate voltage is then 300 volts - 20 volts = 280 volts dc. Now, consider the 20-volt dropped
across the cathode resistor. Plate voltage becomes 280 volts - 20 volts = 260 volts. To understand this a
little more thoroughly, look at figure 1-24. In view A, the source voltage is 300 volts dc. There are two
ways that this voltage can be looked at; either the plate is at +300 volts and the cathode is at 0 volts
(ground), or the plate is at +150 volts and the cathode is at -150 volts. In electronics, it is common
practice to assume that the plate is at +300 volts while the cathode is at 0 volts. To simplify this
discussion, we will assume that the plate is at +150 volts, and the cathode is at -150 volts. The potential
difference between the plate and the cathode is 300 volts. If a plate-load resistor is installed, as shown in
view B,  20 volts are dropped by R
</p><p class="paragraph"> L. The potential difference between the plate and the cathode is now
280 volts. In view C, Rk has now been placed in the same circuit. Rk drops 20 volts. Therefore, the effect
of cathode biasing is to reduce the maximum positive signal that the circuit can produce. In this case, the
maximum positive signal has been reduced by 20 volts. Despite these disadvantages, cathode biasing has
two main advantages. It is simple and economical.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Grid-Leak Biasing
</h3><p class="paragraph">The second type of self-biasing to be discussed is GRID-LEAK BIAS. As the name implies, bias
voltage is developed in the grid leg portion of the circuit. Bias voltage in this type of biasing is derived by
allowing the positive input signal to draw grid current through a circuit made up of a resistor and a
capacitor. There are two types of grid-leak bias commonly in use: SHUNT TYPE and SERIES TYPE.
Because shunt type grid-leak biasing is the simplest, we will discuss it first. Figure 1-25 depicts a
simplified triode circuit using the shunt-type grid-leak biasing. Before we begin the explanation of shunt</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">grid-leak biasing, there is one thing you should bear in mind. Because the bias is derived from the
positive input signal through capacitive action, the input signal must go through several positive
alternations before the final operating bias voltage is achieved. We will explain why this is so in the
following discussion.
</p><p class="paragraph">View A of figure 1-25 shows the circuit under quiescent conditions. You will notice that the circuit
is similar to the one we used to explain the action of a triode. The only additions are the grid resistor, Rg
coupling capacitor, Cc, and resistance rgk. Resistance rgk doesn’t exist as a physical component, but it is
used to represent the internal tube resistance between the triode’s cathode and grid. Electrically, rgk is
quite small, about 500 ohms. Under quiescent conditions, some conduction occurs through the tube. Some
electrons will strike the wires of the grid, and a small amount of GRID CURRENT will flow through Rg
to ground. This will cause the right-hand plate of Cc to go slightly negative. This slight negative charge
will, in turn, keep the grid of the tube slightly negative. This limits the number of electrons that strike the
grid wires.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view B of the figure, the first positive alternation of a series of ac alternations, Ein is applied to the
circuit. The positive-going voltage causes the left-hand plate of Cc to go positive. The left-hand plate must
lose electrons to go positive. These electrons leave the left-hand plate of Cc and travel to the input source
where they will be coupled to ground. From ground, current flows through Rg causing a negative (bottom)
to positive (top) voltage drop across Rg. In effect, the ac signal has been coupled across the capacitor.
Because of this, capacitors are said to pass the ac signal while blocking dc. (In reality, the ac signal is
coupled around the capacitor.) In view C of the figure, the positive-going voltage at the top of Rg will be
coupled to the grid causing the grid to go positive. The positively charged grid will attract electrons from
the electron stream in the tube. Grid current will flow from the grid to the right-hand plate of Cc. This will
cause the right-hand plate to go negative. (Electrostatic repulsion from the right-hand plate of Cc will
force electrons from the left-hand plate of Cc, causing it to go positive.) The electrons will flow through
the signal source, to ground, from ground to the cathode, from the cathode to the grid, and finally to the</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">right-hand plate of Cc. This is the biasing charge cycle. You may wonder why the charge current went
through the tube rather than through Rg. When the grid goes positive in response to the positive-going
input signal, electrostatic attraction between the grid and cathode increases. This, in turn, reduces the
resistance (rgk) between the grid and cathode. Current always follows the path of least resistance. Thus,
the capacitor charge path is through the tube and not through Rg.
</p><p class="paragraph">When the first negative alternation is applied to the circuit (view D), the left-hand plate of Cc must
go negative. To do this, electrons are drawn from the right-hand plate. The electrons travel from the
right-hand plate of Cc, through Rg causing a voltage drop negative (top) to positive (bottom), from the
bottom of Rg, through the source, to the left-hand plate of Cc. Cc will discharge for the duration of the
negative alternation. BUT Cc can only discharge through Rg, which is a high-resistance path,
compared to the charge path. Remember from your study of capacitors that RC time constants and the
rate of discharge increase with the size of R. Cc can therefore charge through the low resistance of rgk to
its maximum negative value during the positive half-cycle. Because Cc discharges through Rg (the high
resistance path), it cannot completely discharge during the duration of the negative half-cycle. As a result,
at the completion of the negative alternation, Cc still retains part of the negative charge it gained during
the positive alternation. When the next positive alternation starts, the right-hand plate of Cc will be more
negative than when the first positive alternation started.
</p><p class="paragraph">During the next cycle, the same process will be repeated, with Cc charging on the positive alternation
and discharging a lesser amount during the negative alternation. Therefore, at the end of the second cycle,
Cc will have an even larger negative charge than it did after the first cycle. You might think that the
charge on Cc will continue to increase until the tube is forced into cutoff. This is not the case. As the
negative charge on the right-hand plate of Cc forces the grid more negative, electrostatic attraction
between the grid and cathode decreases. This, in effect, increases the resistance (rgk) between the cathode
and the grid, until rgk becomes, in effect, the same size as Rg. At this point, charge and discharge of Cc
will equal one another and the grid will remain at some negative, steady voltage. What has happened in
this circuit is that Cc and Rg, through the use of unequal charge and discharge paths, have acted to change
the ac input to a negative dc voltage. The extent of the bias on the grid will depend on three things: the
amplitude of the input, the frequency of the input, and the size of Rg and Cc. This type of biasing has the
advantage of being directly related to the amplitude of the input signal. If the amplitude increases, biasing
increases in step with it. The main limiting factor is the amount of distortion that you may be willing to
tolerate. Distortion occurs during the positive alternation when the grid draws current. Current drawn
from the electron stream by the grid never reaches the plate; therefore the negative-going output is not a
faithful reproduction of the input, while the positive-going output (during the negative input cycle) will be
a faithful reproduction of the input. This is similar to the situation shown in the flattopped portion of the
output signal in figure 1-20.
</p><p class="paragraph">The SERIES GRID-LEAK BIAS circuit shown in figure 1-26 operates similarly to the shunt grid-
leak circuit. When the first positive alternation is applied to the left-hand plate of the grid capacitor, Cg,
the left-hand plate must lose electrons to go positive with the input. Electrons will leave the left-hand
plate and flow through Rg, causing a negative (left-hand side) to positive (right-hand side) voltage drop.
From the right-hand side of Rg, the electrons will flow to the right-hand plate of Cg. The positive voltage
developed at the right-hand side of Rg will be coupled to the grid. As the grid goes positive, it will draw
current, causing Cg to start to charge through the low resistance path of the tube. During the negative
alternation of the input, Cg will discharge through the high resistance path of Rg. Once again it will not be
completely discharged at the end of the negative alternation, and the capacitor will continue on its way
toward charge equilibrium.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

application, grid bias has been increased to -9 volts. We will assume that the tube reaches cutoff when the
voltage on the grid is -10 volts. Under these conditions, when the input reaches -10 volts, the tube will cut
off and stay cut off until the input goes above -10 volts. The tube conducts during the entire duration of
the positive alternation and part of the negative alternation. If you remember back in the discussion of
distortion, we pointed out that this represents distortion. In some amplifiers, faithful reproduction of the
input is not an important requirement. Class AB amplifiers are used only where this distortion can be
tolerated.

the physical structure of the tube. The effects that the physical structure of a tube has on the tube’s
operation are collectively called TUBE CONSTANTS. Four of the most important of these tube
constants are: TRANSIENT TIME, INTERELECTRODE CAPACITANCE,
TRANSCONDUCTANCE, and AMPLIFICATION FACTOR.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Unlike electron flow in a conductor, electrons in a vacuum tube do not move at the speed of light.
Their velocity is determined by the potential difference between the plate and the cathode. The amount of
time the electrons take to travel from the cathode to the plate is called TRANSIT TIME. As a result of
this time difference, the appearance of a signal at the end of a tube is not followed instantaneously by a
change in current flow in the tube. Under normal conditions, the effect of this small time lag between the
input signal and a change in tube current is unnoticed. However, at frequencies such as those used in radar
equipment, this is not the case. Transit time at these frequencies has a very marked effect on tube
operation. It is a major factor that limits the use of a given tube at higher frequencies.

the tube. The output is caused by the voltage dropped across RL due to current flow from tube conduction.
In all the demonstrations of gain, we assumed that RL was held constant and current through the tube was
varied. In this manner we achieved a voltage gain. If the resistance of RL is changed by the designer, the
gain of a triode circuit can be either increased or decreased. This is fairly easy to understand. Assume that
a circuit is composed of a triode with a plate-load resistor of 100 kohms. If a +2 volt signal causes 2
additional milliamperes to conduct through the tube, the voltage drop across RL (the output) will be:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The problem now is: at what voltage and polarity should the screen grid be operated? If the screen
grid were operated at a potential that would make it negative in relation to the control grid, it would act as
a negative screen between the plate and control grid. As a result, gain would be reduced. If the screen grid
were operated at plate potential, it would draw current from the electron stream when the tube conducts.
Because of this, the value of Rsg is normally selected to cause the screen grid to be positive in relation to
the control grid, but not as positive as the plate.
</p><p class="paragraph">Despite this precaution, the screen grid still draws some current from the electron stream. Any signal
applied to the control grid will appear at the screen grid inverted by 180º from the input signal. This is
undesirable, as it reduces the gain of the tube. Consider the effect if the control grid goes positive.
Conduction through the tube increases, and since the screen grid is in the electron stream, it will draw
some current. This causes the screen grid to go toward negative potential (less positive). The effect then,
is to place a negative-going electrode between the plate and positive-going control grid. The plate
becomes partially screened by the negative-going screen grid, and again, gain will decrease. Because the
signal at the screen grid is always 180º out of phase with the control grid, its effect will always be to
oppose the effect of the control grid.
</p><p class="paragraph">To overcome this, a bypass capacitor (Csg) is connected between the screen grid and ground. The
addition of this capacitor will shunt, or pass, the ac variations on the screen grid to ground while
maintaining a steady dc potential on the screen grid. In other words, Csg moves all of the undesired effects
mentioned in the previous paragraph.
</p><p class="paragraph">One very useful characteristic of the tetrode tube is the relationship between the plate and screen
grid. The screen grid will lessen the effect that a decreasing plate potential (negative-going signal) has on
conduction through the tube. In a triode, when the grid goes positive, the plate goes negative. This
decreases electrostatic attraction across the tube and tends to decrease the gain somewhat.
</p><p class="paragraph">In a tetrode, the screen grid has the ability to isolate the effect that ac variations on the plate have on
the electron stream.
</p><p class="paragraph">The positively charged screen grid will accelerate electrons across the tube even though the plate is
negative going. As long as the plate remains positive in relation to the cathode, it will draw off these
accelerated electrons. As a result, conduction through the tube when the plate is going negative will not
be decreased. This is another big advantage of screen-grid tubes.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TETRODE-CHARACTERISTICS-1-46-">TETRODE CHARACTERISTICS
</h2><p class="paragraph">Because the screen grid is in the electron stream, it will always draw some current. The current
drawn by the screen grid will be lost to the plate. This means that the transconductance of a tetrode, which
is based on the amount of plate current versus control-grid voltage, will be lower in tetrodes than in
triodes. The formula for transconductance of a triode,
</p><h3 class="subsection">must be adjusted for screen-grid current, and becomes
</h3><p class="paragraph">As you can see, the transconductance for a tetrode can never be as high as that of a triode of similar
construction.
</p><p class="paragraph">While lowered transconductance in a tetrode is an undesirable characteristic, it is not the reason that
tetrodes have found little acceptance in electronics. The factor that severely limits the operation of
tetrodes is SECONDARY EMISSION.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because the screen grid is positively charged, electrons traveling from the cathode to the plate are
accelerated. Electrons are accelerated to such an extent that they dislodge electrons from the plate when
they strike it. This is similar to the manner in which a high-velocity rifle bullet fired into a pile of sawdust
throws sawdust about. Some of these electrons are fired back into the tube, where they tend to accumulate
between the screen grid and the plate. This effect is most pronounced when the signal at the control grid is
going positive and conduction through the tube is increasing. The plate in this situation is going negative
in answer to the control-grid signal. This causes the electrons accumulating between the plate and screen
grid to be attracted to the screen grid. The current that is drawn by the screen grid is lost to the plate and
gain is decreased. Gain is also decreased in another way. The negative charge accumulated by secondary
emission causes some of the electrons (from the cathode) to be repelled from the plate, which further
reduces gain.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another undesirable characteristic of tetrodes associated with secondary emission is that the outputs
are NOISY. What this means is that small sporadic signals appear on the main output signal, as shown in
figure 1-32. When electrons are knocked from the plate, they represent losses of plate current and
corresponding positive pulses on the output. Electrons falling back to the plate represent increases in plate
current and cause negative-going pulses to appear in the output.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-PENTODE-1-47-">THE PENTODE
</h2><p class="paragraph">The problem of secondary emission associated with the screen grid of a tetrode has been reduced
by—you guessed it, the addition of another grid.
</p><p class="paragraph">This third grid, called a SUPPRESSOR GRID, is placed between the screen grid and the plate. The
suppressor grid is normally connected either internally or externally to the cathode and bears the same
charge as the cathode. This is shown in figure 1-33. Because of its negative potential (relative to
individual electrons), any electrons that are emitted by the plate, through secondary emission, are repelled
back toward the plate.

</p><p class="paragraph">You might think that a grid with a negative potential placed close to the plate would interfere with
the electron stream. However, this is not the case. Because the suppressor grid is negatively charged, it
will not draw grid current. Additionally, the wide spacing within the mesh of the suppressor and its
location between two positive elements of the tube ensures that the suppressor grid’s effect on the electron
stream will be minimum. Only the electrons emitted by secondary emission from the plate are affected by
the suppressor grid.

applications.

</p><p class="paragraph">The CATHODE is the electron-emitting element of a tube. Cathodes are usually composed of
special materials that are heated either directly or indirectly.
</p><p class="paragraph">DIODE OPERATION depends upon current flow through the tube. Because the cathode is the only
electron-emitting element in the tube, current can only flow in one direction, from the cathode to the
plate. For current to flow, the plate must be positive relative to the cathode. When the plate is negative
relative to the cathode, current cannot flow within the tube.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The CHARACTERISTIC CURVE for an electron tube is a graphic plot of plate current (Ip) versus
plate voltage (Ep). From this, dc plate resistance can be computed by the formula:
</p><p class="paragraph">FACTORS THAT LIMIT VACUUM TUBE OPERATION are plate dissipation, maximum
average current, maximum peak-plate current, and peak-inverse voltage.
</p><p class="paragraph">DIODE RECTIFIERS take advantage of the fact that diodes will conduct in only one direction.
When ac voltages are applied to diodes, conduction occurs only on the alternation that makes the plate
positive relative to the cathode. Because of this, the output current consists of one polarity. Because it
flows in pulses rather than continuously, it is called pulsating dc.
</p><p class="paragraph">DIODE CONSTRUCTION is the basic construction plan of most vacuum tubes. The tube is
constructed of the following parts: filament and/or cathodes, plates, envelope, and base.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">A TRIODE is basically a diode with a control grid mounted between the plate and the cathode. The
control grid gives the triode the ability to amplify signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">The OPERATION OF A TRIODE depends on the ability of the control grid to either increase or
decrease conduction through the tube in response to an ac input signal. The output voltage is developed
across the tube between the cathode and plate because of the voltage drop across the plate-load resistor
changing as the plate current responds to the input signal.
</p><p class="paragraph">TUBE BIASING is the process of placing a dc voltage, usually negative, on the grid. Bias has
several functions in circuit design. Biasing may be divided into two types: fixed and self. Tubes using
fixed bias have a dc voltage applied to their control grids from an external source such as a battery. Self-</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

common types of self-biasing are cathode biasing and grid-leak biasing.
</p><p class="paragraph">The CLASS OF OPERATION OF AN AMPLIFIER is determined by the bias applied to a triode.
An amplifier operating as class A conducts continually through the duration of the input cycle. Class AB
operation occurs when the amplifier conducts for more than half but less than the entire duration of the
input cycle. A class B amplifier conducts for only 50% of the input cycle. The class C amplifier conducts
for less than half of the input cycle.
</p><p class="paragraph">TRANSIT TIME is the time required for electrons emitted by the cathode to reach the plate.
Because transit time in a vacuum tube is considerably less than the speed of light, vacuum tube operation
is affected at high frequencies.

covered in chapter 1 have been used in the majority of electronic circuits. However, these types of tubes
do have limits, size, frequency, and power handling capabilities.

circuit can be decreased by enclosing more than one tube within a single envelope, as mentioned in

tubes require more than the three grids found in conventional tubes. In some cases, up to seven grids may
be used. These types of tubes are called multi-electrode tubes and are normally classified according to the
number of grids they contain. An example of this is illustrated in figure 2-3. Here, you see a tube with
five grids; hence, its name is "pentagrid." The application of these tube types is beyond the scope of this
module, but because multi-electrode tubes have been commonly used you should be aware of their
existence.

suitable as power amplifiers. Because of high-plate resistance and internal construction, tubes such as the
triode, tetrode, and pentode are used only as voltage amplifiers. When power amplification is required
(high-current requirements), special-purpose tubes called POWER PENTODES and BEAM POWER
tubes are used.

sections of the grids. Notice that each grid is offset, or staggered, from the grid directly behind it. This
arrangement of grids permits each grid to be exposed to the electron stream flowing from cathode to plate.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In this way, each grid will have maximum effect on the electron stream. There are two undesirable effects
associated with the staggered grid arrangement that make it unsuitable for use in power amplifiers.
</p><p class="paragraph">First, no direct path exists between the cathode and the plate. Electrons leaving the cathode must run
an obstacle course around the grid wires to reach the plate. Some of these electrons are deflected by the
grid and scattered and, thus, never reach the plate. Second, some electrons strike the grid wires and are
removed from the electron stream as grid current. Because of these two undesirable effects, the amount of
plate current that can flow through the tube is greatly reduced. Because of this loss of electrons from the
stream, conventional tetrodes and pentodes are not suitable for power amplifiers. Therefore, a special
class of tubes has been developed to overcome this problem—the BEAM POWER TUBES and
POWER PENTODE TUBES.
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 2-5 shows the cross section of the power pentode. Notice that there is no staggered grid
arrangement. Instead, each grid wire is directly in line with the grid in front of and behind it. The screen
and suppressor grids are shielded from the electron stream by the control grid. Because the screen grid is
"shielded" by the control grid, it can draw little grid current from the electron stream.

</p><p class="paragraph">reach the plate. Thus, the tube has the advantage of high power output and high efficiency. An added
advantage to this type of grid arrangement is high-power sensitivity. This means that the tube can respond
to much smaller input signals than the conventional electron tube. The reason for this is obvious; many
more electrons reach the plate from the cathode. Therefore, large plate currents can be obtained from
relatively weak input signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">Another type of power amplifier tube that is similar to the power pentode is the BEAM POWER
TUBE. Beam power tubes have the same grid arrangement as the power pentodes. In addition, they use a
set of beam-forming plates to force the electron stream into concentrated beams. Figure 2-6 depicts the
internal construction of a beam-forming tube and its schematic representation. Notice that the beam-
forming plates surround the grids and their supporting structures and are internally connected to the
cathode. This internal connection ensures that the beam-forming plates are at the same negative potential
as the cathode. Electrons that are emitted from the sides of the cathode are repelled from the grid supports
and into the electron stream by the negative charge on the beam-forming plates. Electrons pass to the
plate through the spaces between the beam-forming plates and, by doing so, are concentrated into beams.
Because the beam-forming plates are at a negative potential, any electrons emitted by secondary emission
are repelled back to the plate. The effect of the beam-forming plates is to increase the number of electrons
in the electron stream by forcing stray electrons emitted from the sides of the cathode away from the grid
supports and into the electron beam. Electrons that are deflected from the grid wires are also forced into
the beam. This increases the total current flowing to the plate. For this reason, both beam-forming and
power pentodes are suitable for use as power amplifiers.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-VARIABLE-MU-TUBES-2-6-">VARIABLE-MU TUBES
</h2><p class="paragraph">In most electron-tube circuits, the operating level of a tube is determined by the level of bias. When a
negative-bias voltage is applied to the control grid of a tube, with no input signal, the conduction through
the tube is reduced; thus the damage to the tube is minimized. There is one drawback to this. Because the
control grid is already negatively charged by the bias voltage, the negative alternation of a large input
signal will drive the tube into cutoff long before the positive alternation can drive the tube into saturation.
Once the negative alternation reaches a certain level (determined by the bias voltage and tube
characteristics), the tube simply cuts off. For this reason, conventional tubes, which you previously
studied, are called SHARP-CUTOFF TUBES. Because of this sharp cutoff, the range of amplification of
the conventional tube is limited by the bias voltage and tube characteristics. Once this range is exceeded,
the output becomes distorted due to cutoff.
</p><p class="paragraph">In most applications, the sharp cutoff feature of conventional electron tubes causes no problems.
However, in some applications electron tubes are required to amplify relatively large input signals
without distortion. For this reason, the variable-mu tube was developed. VARIABLE-MU TUBES have
the ability to reduce their mu, or (µ), as the input signal gets larger. As the mu (µ) decreases, the
likelihood that the tube will be driven into cutoff decreases. (For an amplifier, this may appear to be self-
defeating, but it isn't.) The idea is to amplify large input signals as much as possible without causing the
tube to cutoff or create distortion. Because of their ability to avoid being driven into cutoff, variable-mu
tubes are called REMOTE-CUTOFF TUBES. You should be aware, however, that a variable-mu tube
can be driven into cutoff, but the amplitude of the input signal required to do so is considerably greater
than in conventional sharp-cutoff tubes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The key to the ability of a variable-mu tube to decrease gain with an increase in the amplitude of the
input lies in its grid construction.
</p><p class="paragraph">To understand how the unique grid construction of a variable-mu tube works, we will first examine
the grid operation of a conventional tube during cutoff. Look at figure 2-7. Here, you see a diagram of a
conventional sharp-cutoff triode with zero volts applied to the control grid. In view A, the majority of the
electrostatic lines of force leave the positive plate (+) and travel unhindered between the evenly spaced
grid wires to the negative cathode (-). Electrons emitted by the cathode travel along these lines from the
cathode, through the grid spacings, to the plate.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In view B, a bias voltage of -6 volts is applied to the grid. As you can see, some of the electrostatic
lines of force are attracted to the negatively charged grid wires while the rest pass through the grid
spacings. Because there are fewer lines of force reaching the cathode, there are fewer paths for electrons
to use to reach the plate. As a result, conduction through the tube is decreased.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view C, the negative potential of the grid has been raised to -20 volts, which drives the tube into
cutoff. All of the electrostatic lines of force terminate at the negatively charged grid, instead of continuing
on to the cathode. The electrons emitted by the cathode will not feel the electrostatic attractive force of
the positively charged plate. Under these conditions, current cannot flow through the tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">Now look at figure 2-8. Here you see a diagram of a variable-mu, or remote-cutoff, tube. The only
difference between the remote-cutoff tube depicted and the sharp-cutoff tube is in the grid wire spacing.
In the conventional sharp-cutoff tube, the grid wires are evenly spaced, while in the remote-cutoff tube
the grid wires in the middle of the grid are placed relatively far apart. This is shown in view A.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In view B, the control grid is at zero potential (0 volts). Just as in the sharp-cutoff tube, electrons
leave the cathode and travel along the lines of electrostatic attraction, through the spaces between the grid
wires to the plate. In view C, a bias voltage of -6 volts is applied to the grid. Because of the close spacing
of the grid wires at the ends of the grid, electrostatic lines of force at the ends are effectively terminated.
The lines of force can only pass between the widely spaced grid wires closer to the center of the grid.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view D, the same negative potential -20 volts) is applied to the grid that caused the conventional
sharp-cutoff tube discussed earlier to go into cutoff. This voltage is high enough to terminate most of the
electrostatic lines of force on the grid wire. But, because of the wide spacing between the center grid
wires, some electrostatic lines of force are still able to pass between the center grid wires and reach the
cathode. Conduction will still occur in the tube, but at a reduced level. If the grid is driven even more
negative, lines of force will be blocked from reaching the cathode, except at the very center of the grid.
As you can see, the remote-cutoff tube, by its ability to reduce gain (conduction), handles large signals
without going into cutoff. A variable-mu tube such as a 6SK7 with -3 volts applied to the grid will have a
transconductance of about 2000 (µ) mhos. If the grid is driven to -35 volts, the transconductance of the
tube will decrease to 10 (µ) mhos. This same increase in negative-grid voltage would have driven a
conventional tube into cutoff long before the grid reached -35 volts.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">In the earlier discussion of conventional-electron tubes, you learned some of the limitations of tubes.
One of these limitations was that the conventional tube was not able to operate (amplify) at extremely
high frequencies such as those used in radar equipment. Even at frequencies lower than those used in
radar equipment, problems occur. For example, at ultrahigh frequencies (300 MHz to 3000 MHz), transit
time effects make the operation of a conventional-electron tube impossible. For this reason, the special
ultrahigh frequency tubes were developed to operate within this frequency range.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before we discuss the way in which special uhf tubes counter the effects of transit time, you should
understand the manner in which transit time affects conventional tubes.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-LIMITATION-OF-TRANSIT-TIME-2-9-">LIMITATION OF TRANSIT TIME
</h2><p class="paragraph">We will explain the limitation of transit time by using figure 2-9. In view A, the positive-going
alternation of a uhf ac signal is applied to the grid of a conventional-triode tube. The first positive-going
alternation reduces the negative bias on the grid, and electrons start to move toward the grid. Since the
input is an ultrahigh frequency signal, the majority of the electrons cannot pass the grid before the input
signal progresses to the negative alternation. The electrons that have not yet passed the grid are either
stopped or repelled back toward the cathode. This is shown in view B. Before these electrons can move
very far, the second positive alteration reaches the grid, and causes even more electrons to move from the
cathode (view C). At the same time, the electrons that were repelled from the grid toward the cathode by
the first negative alternation feel the effect of the positive-going grid. These electrons reverse direction
and again move toward the grid. Because these electrons had to first reverse direction, they are now
moving slower than the electrons that are attracted from the cathode by the second positive alteration. The
result is that the electrons from the cathode catch up to the slower moving electrons and the two groups
combine (view C). This action is called BUNCHING.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">In effect, the area between the grid and cathode becomes highly negatively charged, as shown in
view D. This negative charge is surrounded by an electrostatic field. The electrostatic field cuts the grid
and repels electrons that are present in the grid. As electrons are forced from the grid, the grid tries to go
positive. Unfortunately, this tendency toward a positive charge attracts electrons from the mass or
bunched charge. Thus, as an electron is forced from the grid; it is replaced by another from the massed
charge. Electrons forced from the grid represent grid current (Ig), as shown in view E. The grid current
flows from the grid through Rg, to the cathode, from the cathode, to the massed charged, and back again
to the grid, The movement of current in this manner is, in effect, a path for current flow from the cathode
to the grid. Because current flows between the cathode and grid, the resistance (rgk) between these
elements is lowered to the point of a short circuit. The grid, in effect, is short circuited to the cathode and
ceases to function; and this, in turn, lowers tube efficiency dramatically. This is shown in view F of figure
2-9.
</p><p class="paragraph">Transit time may be decreased by reducing the spacing between electrodes or by increasing the
electrode voltages, which in turn increases electron velocity through the tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">The problem with the last solution is that the tube does not present an infinite resistance to current
flow. If the operating voltage is raised to an operating potential that is too high, arcing (arc over) occurs
between the cathode and the plate and, most likely, will destroy the tube. For this reason, the effects of
transit time are reduced in uhf tubes by placing the tube elements very close together.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

capacitance and transit time effects are reduced, without reducing the amplification capability of the tube.
A disadvantage to this type of tube construction is that the power-handling capability of these tubes is
also reduced due to the close placement of the tube elements.

their circuits by short wire pins that are sealed in the glass or ceramic envelope. Because of their small
size, acorn tubes are usually used in low-power uhf circuits.

between elements become very difficult. Not only are the elements hard to keep parallel with each other
during the manufacturing process, but they also have a tendency to warp and sag under normal operating
conditions. Since these elements are already as close together as possible, any reduction in element
spacing can cause arcing. Therefore, a new type of tube was developed to prevent arcing or element
sagging in conventional tubes. This tube is known as the planar tube.

</p><p class="paragraph">A typical planar tube is depicted in figure 2-13. Notice that the tube elements are mounted close to
each other and are parallel to one another. The oxide coating of the cathode is applied to the top surface
only. Therefore, the emitting surface of the cathode is parallel to the plate and the grid.
</p><p class="paragraph">The plate of the tube consists of a cylindrical stud. This stud-plate construction has two purposes. Its
flat lower surface serves as a parallel plate, and its external upper end serves as the external-plate
connection from the tube to the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of its construction, the planar tube cannot use the ladder-type grid, with which you are
familiar. Instead, the grid, formed into a circle, is composed of a wire mesh similar to that of a common
screen door.
</p><p class="paragraph">The cathode structure is manufactured in two parts. Point A of figure 2-13 is the metallic shell of the
tube and is used to couple (or connect) unwanted radio frequency signals from the cathode to ground.
This connection is not, however, a direct coupling. The wafer at point C of figure 2-13 is composed of
mica, which serves as a dielectric. The lower extension of the cathode serves as one plate of the capacitor,
while the other plate is formed from the flattened upper portion of the cathode connector ring. The
cathode has a direct connection to the tube pin through the connector labeled point B. You might think
that this is a rather complicated method to connect the cathode to a circuit, but it serves a purpose. At high
frequencies, the wiring of a circuit can pick up radio frequency signals and retransmit them. If the wiring
involved happens to be the wiring used to supply dc voltages to the circuit, all the tubes in the circuit will
receive the signal. The result will be massive distortion throughout the circuit.
</p><p class="paragraph">The problem can be eliminated by isolating the dc and radio frequency circuits from each other. In
planar tubes, this is fairly simple. The point A ring is grounded. Any rf signals that the cathode may pick
up through tube conduction are grounded or shorted to ground through the capacitive coupling with the
point A shell. In other words, the point A shell (capacitive ground) serves the same function as the bypass</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

current than high-vacuum tubes, and they tend to maintain a constant IR drop across their terminals
within a limited range of currents. The principle of operation of the gas-filled tube involves the process
called ionization.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTION-IN-GAS-DIODES-2-15-">ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION IN GAS DIODES
</h2><p class="paragraph">An operating gas-filled tube has molecules, ions, and free electrons present within the envelope. In a
gas-filled diode, the electron stream from the hot cathode encounters gas molecules on its way to the
plate. When an electron collides with a gas molecule, the energy transmitted by the collision may cause
the molecule to release an electron. This second electron then may join the original stream of electrons
and is capable of freeing other electrons. This process, which is cumulative, is a form of ionization. The
free electrons, greatly increased in quantity by ionization, continue to the plate of the diode. The molecule
which has lost an electron is called an ion and bears a positive charge. The positive ions drift toward the
negative cathode and during their journey attract additional electrons from the cathode.
</p><p class="paragraph">The velocity of the electrons traveling toward the plate varies directly with the plate voltage. If the
plate voltage is very low, the gas-filled diode acts almost like an ordinary diode except that the electron
stream is slowed to a certain extent by the gas molecules. These slower-moving electrons do not have
enough energy to cause ionization when they hit the gas atoms. After the plate voltage is raised to the
proper level of conduction, the electrons have enough energy to cause ionization when they hit the gas
molecules. The plate potential at which ionization occurs is known as the IONIZATION POINT, or
FIRING POTENTIAL, of a gas tube. If the plate voltage is reduced after ionization, it can be allowed to
go several volts below the firing potential before ionization (and hence, high-plate current) win cease. The
value of the plate voltage (Ep) at which ionization stops is called the DEIONIZATION POTENTIAL, or
EXTINCTION POTENTIAL. The firing point is always at a higher plate potential than the deionization
point.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-GAS-TRIODE-2-15-">GAS TRIODE
</h2><p class="paragraph">The point at which the gas ionizes can be controlled more accurately by inserting a grid into the gas
diode. A negative voltage on the grid can prevent electrons from going to the plate, even when the plate
voltage is above the normal firing point. If the negative-grid voltage is reduced to a point where a few
electrons are allowed through the grid, ionization takes place. The grid immediately loses control, because
the positive ions gather about the grid wires and neutralize the grid’s negative charge. The gas triode then
acts as a diode. If the grid is made much more negative in an effort to control the plate current, the only
effect is that more ions collect about the grid wires—tube continues to conduct as a diode. Only by
removing the plate potential or reducing it to the point where the electrons do not have enough energy to
produce ionization will tube conduction and the production of positive ions stop. Only after the
production of positive ions is stopped will the grid be able to regain control.
</p><p class="paragraph">Such gas-filled triodes are known as THYRATRONS. Thyratrons are used in circuits where current
flow in the thyratrons output circuit is possible only when a certain amount of voltage is present on the
thyratrons grid. The flow of plate current persists even after the initiating grid voltage is no longer present
at the grid, and it can be stopped only by removing or lowering the plate potential. The symbols for the
gas-filled diode, the voltage regulator, and the thyratron are the same as those for high-vacuum tubes
except that a dot is placed within the envelope circle to signify the presence of gas. Some examples of
gas-filled tube schematic symbols are shown in figure 2-15.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Before leaving this section, you should be aware of one precaution associated with mercury-vapor
tubes. The mercury vapor is not placed in the tube as a vapor; instead a small amount of liquid mercury is
placed in the tube before it is sealed. When the liquid mercury comes in contact with the hot filament, the
mercury vaporizes.
</p><p class="paragraph">To ensure that the mercury has vaporized sufficiently, the filament voltage must be applied to
mercury-vapor tubes for at least 30 seconds before the plate voltage is applied. If vaporization is
incomplete, only partial ionization is possible. Under these conditions, the application of plate voltage
results in a relatively high voltage drop across the tube (remember E = I × R), and the positive ions
present are accelerated to a high velocity in the direction of the cathode. As the ions strike the cathode,
they tear away particles of the emitting surface, usually causing permanent damage to the cathode and the
tube. When the mercury is completely vaporized, the action of the gas is such that the voltage drop across
the tube can never rise above the ionization potential (about 15 volts). At this low potential, positive-ion
bombardment of the cathode does not result in damage to the emitting surface.
</p><p class="paragraph">Generally, when gas-filled tubes are in the state of ionization, they are illuminated internally by a
soft, blue glow. This glow is brightest in the space between the electrodes and of lesser intensity
throughout the remainder of the tube envelope. This glow is normal and must not be confused with the
glow present in high-vacuum tubes when gases are present. A high-vacuum tube with a bluish glow is
gassy and should be replaced. The ionization of these gases will distort the output of the tube and may
cause the tube to operate with much higher plate current than it can carry safely.

filaments. Thus, its name "COLD-CATHODE TUBE." In the tubes covered in this text thus far,

electrons can be caused in another manner. If the potential between the plate and the cathode is raised to
the point where tube resistance is overcome, current will flow from the cathode whether it is heated or</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">not. In most applications in electronics, this method is not used because it is not as efficient as thermionic
emission. There are two applications where cold-cathode emission is used. The first application you are
already familiar with, although you may not be aware of it. Every time you look at a neon sign you are
watching a cold-cathode tube in operation. Thus, the first application of cold-cathode tubes is for visual
display. You are also familiar with the reason for this visual display. In the NEETS module on matter and
energy, we explained that when energy is fed into an atom (neon in this case), electrons are moved, or
promoted, to higher orbits. When they fall back, they release the energy that originally lifted them to their
higher orbits. The energy is in the form of light. Cold-cathode tubes are also used as VOLTAGE
REGULATORS. Because voltage regulators will be dealt with extensively in the next chapter, we will
not cover their operation now. At this point, you only need to understand that a cold-cathode tube has the
ability to maintain a constant voltage drop across the tube despite changes of current flow through the
tube. The tube does this by changing resistance as current flow varies.
</p><p class="paragraph">Examine figure 2-16. Here you see a cold-cathode tube connected to a variable voltage source. The
variable resistor rkp does not exist as a physical component, but is used to represent the resistance
between the cathode and the plate. Most cold-cathode tubes have a firing point (ionizing voltage) at about
115 volts. Thus, the tube in view A of the figure is below the firing point. Because the tube lacks
thermionic emission capabilities, no current will flow and the tube will have a resistance (rkp) near
infinity. The potential difference between the plate and ground under these conditions will be equal to the
source (Ebb) voltage, as shown on the voltmeter.
</p><p class="paragraph">In view B, the source voltage has been raised to the firing point of 115 volts. This causes the gas to
ionize and 5 milliamperes of current will flow through the tube. Because the tube represents a resistance
(rkp), voltage will be dropped across the tube; in this case, 105 volts. The plate-load resistor (RL) will
drop the remaining 10 volts. The resistance of the tube at this time will be equal to:</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

ionize and 40 milliamperes of current to flow through the tube. The increased ionization will lower the
resistance of the tube (rkp). Thus, the tube will still drop 105 volts. The tube’s resistance (rkp) at this time
will be equal to:
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see, increasing the current flow will cause more ionization in the tube and a
corresponding decrease in the tube’s resistance. Because of this, the tube will always have a constant
voltage drop between its plate and cathode throughout its operating range.

Although you may not be aware of this fact, the CATHODE-RAY TUBE shown in figure 2-17 is,
</h3><p class="paragraph">in all probability, the one tube with which you are most familiar. Before you started your study of
electronics, you probably referred to cathode-ray tubes as picture tubes. The cathode-ray tube (CRT) and
the picture tube of a television set are one and the same.

</p><p class="paragraph">Cathode-ray tubes are used in more applications than just television. They can be considered as the
heart of the many types of information.
</p><p class="paragraph">Cathode-ray tubes have one function that cannot be duplicated by any other tube or transistor;
namely, they have the ability to convert electronic signals to visual displays, such as pictures, radar
sweeps, or electronic wave forms.
</p><p class="paragraph">All CRT’s have three main elements: an electron gun, a deflection system, and a screen. The electron
gun provides an electron beam, which is a highly concentrated stream of electrons. The deflection system
positions the electron beam on the screen, and the screen displays a small spot of light at the point where
the electron beam strikes it.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-ELECTRON-GUN-2-19-">THE ELECTRON GUN
</h2><p class="paragraph">The ELECTRON GUN is roughly equivalent to the cathodes of conventional tubes. The cathode of
the electron gun in the CRT is required not only to emit electrons, but also to concentrate emitted
electrons into a tight beam. In the electron tubes that you have studied, the cathode was cylindrical and
emitted electrons in all directions along its entire length. This type of cathode is not suitable for producing
a highly concentrated electron-beam. The cathode of the CRT consists of a small diameter nickel cap. The
closed end of the cap is coated with emitting material. This is shown in figure 2-18. Because of this type
of construction, electrons can only be emitted in one direction. Notice that the emitted electrons shown in
figure 2-18 are leaving the cathode at different angles. If these electrons were allowed to strike the screen,
the whole screen would glow. Since the object of the electron gun is to concentrate the electrons into a
tight beam, a special grid must be used. This special grid is in the form of a solid metal cap with a small
hole in the center. The grid is placed over the emitting surface of the cathode and charged negatively in
relation to the cathode. The dotted lines represent the direction of cathode emitted electron repulsion, as
shown in figure 2-19. Since all emitted electrons leave the cathode (point C), their paths can be identified.
An electron attempting to travel from point C to point B (downward) will instead follow the path from
point C to point E to point P. Consider an electron leaving from C in the direction of point A (upward). Its
path will be curved from point C to point P by electrostatic repulsion. These curving electron paths are
due to the negative potential of the grid coupled with the high positive potential of the anode. The
potential of the anode attracts electrons out of the cathode-grid area past point P toward the screen. The
grid potential may be varied to control the number of electrons allowed to go through the control-grid
opening. Since the brightness or intensity of the display depends on the number of electrons that strike the
screen, the control grid is used to control the brightness of the CRT.

</p><p class="paragraph">The proper name, BRIGHTNESS CONTROL, is given to the potentiometer used to vary the
potential applied to the control grid. The control grid actually serves as an electron lens. It is this
electronic lens that you adjust when you turn up the brightness control on your TV set. Notice that the
effect of the grid is to focus the electron beam at point P in figure 2-19.
</p><p class="paragraph">After passing point P, the electrons start to spread out, or diverge, again. Therefore, it becomes
necessary to provide some additional focusing to force the electrons into a tight beam again. This is done
by two additional positively-charged electrodes as shown in figure 2-20. The first electrode is commonly
called the FOCUSING ANODE. Generally, the focusing anode is charged a few hundred volts positive
with respect to the cathode. Electrons emitted by the cathode are attracted to the focusing anode. This is
the reason that they travel through the small hole in the grid. The second electrode, called the
ACCELERATING ANODE, is charged several thousand volts positive in relation to the cathode. Any
electrons approaching the focusing anode will feel the larger electrostatic pull of the accelerating anode
and will be bent through the opening in the focusing anode and will travel into the area labeled D. You
might think that once an electron is in this region, it is simply attracted to the accelerating anode and that
is the end of it. This does not happen. Because the accelerating anode is cylindrical in shape, the
electrostatic field radiating from it is equal in all directions. Thus, an electron is pulled in all directions at
once, forcing the electron to travel down the center of the tube. Then, the electron is accelerated into the
accelerating anode. Once it passes the mid-point (point E), it feels the electrostatic attraction from the
front wall of the accelerating anode, which causes it to move faster toward the front. Once the electron
reaches point F, equal electrostatic attraction on either side of the opening squeezes it through the small
opening in the front of the anode. From there, it is joined by millions of other electrons and travels in a
tight beam until it strikes the screen (point S).

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-CRT-SCREEN-2-21-">THE CRT SCREEN
</h2><p class="paragraph">The inside of the large end of a CRT is coated with a fluorescent material that gives off light when
struck by electrons. This coating is necessary because the electron beam itself is invisible. The material
used to convert the electrons’ energy into visible light is a PHOSPHOR. Many different types of
phosphor materials are used to provide different colored displays and displays that have different lengths
of PERSISTENCE (duration of display).
</p><p class="paragraph">In one way, the CRT screen is similar to a tetrode vacuum tube. Both suffer from the effects of
secondary emission. In order to reach the screen, electrons from the cathode are accelerated to relatively
high velocities. When these electrons strike the screen, they dislodge other electrons from the material of
the screen. If these secondary emission electrons are allowed to accumulate, they will form a
negatively-charged barrier between the screen and the electron beam, causing a distorted image on the
CRT screen. The method used to control secondary emission, which you are already familiar with, i.e., a
suppressor grid, is not practical in CRT’s. Instead, a special coating called an AQUADAG COATING is
applied to the inside of the tube as shown in figure 2-21. This coating is composed of a conductive
material, such as graphite, and has the same high-positive potential applied to it that is applied to the
accelerating anode. This allows the aquadag to perform two functions. First, since the aquadag coating is
positive, it attracts the secondary emitted electrons and removes them. Second, because the aquadag is
operated at a high-positive potential and is mounted in front of the accelerating anode, it aids in the
acceleration of electrons toward the screen.
</p><p class="paragraph">Before going on, let’s review what you have already learned about CRT operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Electrons are emitted from a specially constructed cathode and move toward the front of the
CRT.

watched TV, you know that a TV picture consists of more than just a bright spot in the center of the
picture tube. Obviously, something is necessary to produce the picture. That something is called
DEFLECTION. For the CRT to work properly, the spot must be moved to various positions on the
screen. In your TV set for example, the spot is moved horizontally across the CRT face to form a series of
tightly packed lines. As each line is displayed, or traced, the electron beam is moved vertically to trace the
next line as shown in figure 2-23. This process starts at the top of the tube and ends when the last line is
traced at the bottom of the CRT screen. Because the beam is swept very quickly across the CRT and the
phosphor continues to glow for a short time after the beam has moved on, you do not see a series of lines,
but a continuous picture.

OSCILLOSCOPE. Remember, the unique function of a CRT is to convert electronic (and electrical)
signals to a visual display. This function of a CRT is used in the oscilloscope to show the waveform of an
electronic signal. To help you understand better how an oscilloscope works, we will discuss the type of
deflection used in oscilloscopes. Bear in mind that the following discussion is only about deflection; we
will cover the actual operation of an oscilloscope in a later NEETS module that deals specifically with
test equipment.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Electrostatic Deflection
</h3><p class="paragraph">As you should know, there are two ways to move an electron (and thus an electron beam): either
with a magnetic or with an electrostatic field. Because of this, there are three possible ways to move or
deflect an electron beam in a CRT: magnetically, electromagnetically, and electrostatically. All three
ways are used in electronics. In general, though, electrostatic and electromagnetic deflection are used
most often. Your TV set, for example, uses electromagnetic deflection, while much of the test equipment
in the Navy uses electrostatic deflection.
</p><p class="paragraph">ELECTROSTATIC DEFLECTION uses principles you are already familiar with. Namely,
opposites attract, and likes repel. Look at figure 2-24, view A. Here you see an electron traveling between
two charged plates, H1 and H2. As you can see, before the electron reaches the charged plates, called
DEFLECTION PLATES, its flight path is toward the center of the screen. In view B, the electron has
reached the area of the deflection plates and is attracted toward the positive plate, H2, while being
repelled from the negative plate, H1. As a result, the electron is deflected to the right on the inside of the
screen. You, the viewer, will see the spot of light on the left side of the CRT face (remember, you are on
the opposite side of the CRT screen). This is shown in view C.
</p><p class="paragraph">A spot of light on the left-hand side of the CRT screen, however, is no more useful than a spot of
light in the center of the screen. To be useful, this spot will have to be converted to a bright line, called a
sweep, across the face of the CRT screen. We will explain the manner in which this is done by using</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

deflection plate, H
</p><p class="paragraph"> 2, has a large positive potential on it while the left plate, H1 has a large negative
potential on it. Thus, when electron 1 reaches the area of the deflection plates, it is attracted to the right
plate while being repelled from the left plate. In view B, electron 2 has reached the area of the deflection
plates. However, before it arrives, R1 and R2 are adjusted to make the right plate less positive and the left
plate less negative. Electron 2 will still be deflected to the right but not as much as electron 1. In view C,
electron 3 has reached the area of the deflection plates. Before it gets there, R1 and R2 are adjusted to the
mid-point. As a result, both plates have 0 volts applied to them. Electron 3 is not deflected and simply
travels to the center of the CRT screen. In view D, electron 4 has reached the area of the deflection plates.
Notice that R1 and R2 have been adjusted to make the right plate negative and the left plate positive. As a
result, electron 4 will be deflected to the left. Finally, in view E, the left plate is at its maximum positive
value. Electron 5 will be deflected to the extreme left. What you see when you are facing the CRT is a
bright luminous line, as shown in view E. While this description dealt with only five electrons, in reality
the horizontal line across a CRT face is composed of millions of electrons. Instead of seeing five bright
spots in a line, you will see only a solid bright line.

</p><p class="paragraph">In summary, the horizontal line displayed on a CRT or on the face of a television tube is made by
sweeping a stream of electrons rapidly across the face of the CRT. This sweeping action, or scanning, is
performed by rapidly varying the voltage potential on the deflection plates as the electron stream passes.
</p><h3 class="subsection">Vertical Deflection
</h3><p class="paragraph">As we mentioned earlier, a CRT can be used to graphically and visually plot an electronic signal,
such as a sine wave. This is done by using a second set of deflection plates called VERTICAL-
DEFLECTION PLATES. Examine figure 2-26. You are looking at the front view (facing the screen) of
a CRT, back into the tube at the deflection plates. In normal usage, the horizontal plates sweep a straight
line of electrons across the screen from left to right while the signal to be displayed is applied to the
vertical deflection plates. A circuit of this type is shown in figure 2-27. We will use this figure to explain
how a sine wave is displayed. First, however, you need to understand what is happening in view A. The
box on the left of the CRT labeled HORIZONTAL-DEFLECTION CIRCUITS is an electronic circuit
that will duplicate the actions of R1 and R2 used earlier in making up a horizontal line. How it works will
be discussed in a later NEETS module. Notice T1; the output of this transformer is applied to the vertical-
deflection plates. The signals applied to the vertical plates are 180º out of phase with each other. Thus,
when one plate is attracting the electron beam, the other will be repelling the electron beam. Because you
are only concerned with what happens inside the CRT, this circuitry will be eliminated and only the CRT
and its deflection plates will be shown, as in view B.

</p><p class="paragraph">Now look at view C. While this illustration looks complicated, don’t let it worry you. You have
already analyzed more complicated diagrams. The sine wave in the center of the screen is the signal that
will be displayed as a result of the two 180º out-of-phase sine waves applied to the vertical-deflection
plates. The five spots on the center sine wave represent the five electrons used to explain horizontal
deflection. Only now these electrons will be deflected both vertically and horizontally. Time lines T1
through T5 represent the time when each like-numbered electron reaches the area of the deflection plates.
Because you already know how the electron beam is swept or deflected horizontally, we will not discuss
horizontal deflection. Just remember that from T1 to T5, the electron beam will be continuously moved
from your left to your right. Now that you know where everything is on the illustration, you are ready to
discover how a sine wave is displayed on a CRT.
</p><p class="paragraph">At time 1 (T1), the sine waves applied to both vertical-deflection plates are at their null points, or
zero volts. As a result, electron 1 is not vertically deflected and strikes the CRT at its vertical center. At
time 2 (T2), the sine wave applied to the top plate is at its maximum negative value. This repels electron 2
toward the bottom of the CRT. At the same time, the sine wave applied to the bottom plate is at the most
positive value, causing electron 2 to be attracted even further toward the bottom of the CRT. Remember,
the beam is also being moved to the left. As a result, electron 2 strikes the CRT face to the right of and
below electron 1. At time 3 (T3), both sine waves applied to the vertical-deflection plates are again at the
null point, or zero volts. Therefore, there is no vertical deflection and electron 3 strikes the CRT face in</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

appear to the right of and above electron 2. At time 4 (T4), the sine wave applied to the top vertical-
deflection plate is at its maximum positive value. This attracts electron 4 toward the top deflection plate.
The upward deflection of electron 4 is increased by the negative-going sine wave (at time 4) applied to
the bottom deflection plate. This negative voltage repels electron 4 upward. Thus, electron 4 strikes the
CRT face to the right of and above electron 3. Finally, at time 5 (T5) both input sine waves are again at
zero volts. As a result, electron 5 is not deflected vertically, only horizontally. (Remember, the beam is
continually moving from right to left.)
</p><p class="paragraph">While this discussion is only concerned with five electrons, vertical scanning, or deflection, involves
millions of electrons in a continuous electron beam. Instead of seeing five spots on the CRT screen, you
will actually see a visual presentation of the sine wave input. This was, as you remember, described
earlier as the unique feature of the CRT. You may have wondered why so much space in this chapter was
taken up with the discussion of the CRT. There are two reasons for this. First, the field of electronics is in
a constant state of evolution. Transistors replaced most vacuum tubes. Transistors are being replaced by
integrated circuits (ICs). As you progress in your career in electronics, you will find that the equipment
you work on will follow this evolution, from transistors to IC chips. Of all the tubes discussed in this text,
the CRT is the least likely to be replaced in the near future. Thus, in all probability, whether your career
in electronics lasts for only the time you spend with this text or 20 years, the CRT will be your constant
companion and co-worker.
</p><p class="paragraph">The second reason for this rather extensive coverage of the CRT is that, while the CRT has a unique
ability, it operates exactly like all the tubes previously discussed.
</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY OF THE CRT
</h1><p class="paragraph">This summary will not only review the CRT, but will also point out the similarities between the CRT
and other tubes.
</p><p class="paragraph">Look at figure 2-28. Here you see both a schematic diagram and a pictorial representation of a CRT.
Each element is identified by a circuit number. We will review briefly the function of each element in a
CRT and its similarity to elements in conventional tubes. This summary will help you tie together
everything you have learned about the CRT and electron tubes in general.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">1. The Heater—serves as the source of heat for the cathode in both the CRT and indirectly heated
tubes.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The Cathode—serves as the source of thermionically emitted electrons in both the CRT and
conventional tubes. The major difference is that in the CRT, the cathode is circular in shape and
the outer surface is coated to ensure that electron emission is roughly unidirectional.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. The Control Grid-in both the CRT and conventional vacuum tubes, the control grid controls the
number of electrons that will be fired across "the gap." The major difference is in the physical
construction. Conventional tubes use a wire-mesh ladder-type grid, while the CRT uses a cap-
like grid.
</p><p class="paragraph">4. The Focusing Anode—in the CRT, this anode serves a dual purpose of attracting electrons from
the area of the control grid and focusing the electrons into a beam. Its function of attracting
electrons from the area of the grid is similar to the action of the plate in a conventional tube. The
focusing action of the anode is similar to that performed by beam-forming plates in the beam-
forming tetrode. Bear in mind, though, that beam-forming plates are negatively charged and
repel electrons into electron sheets, while the focusing anode is positively charged and attracts
electrons into beam.
</p><p class="paragraph">5. The Accelerating Anode—in the CRT, this anode is used to accelerate the electrons toward the
front of the tube. Its action is similar to the screen grid of tetrodes and pentodes. But remember,
while the screen grid in conventional tubes accelerates electrons toward the plate, its primary
purpose is to reduce interelectrode capacitance, NOT accelerate electrons.
</p><p class="paragraph">6. The Vertical-Deflection Plates—in the CRT, these plates move the electron beam up and down
the screen. The input signal is usually applied to these plates. While no equivalent element is</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">found in conventional tubes, the principle employed (electrostatic attraction and repulsion) forms
the heart of all vacuum tube operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">7. The Horizontal-Deflection Plates—in the CRT, these plates move the electron beam by
electrostatic attraction and repulsion, horizontally across the CRT screen. In most equipment
using the CRT, including television sets, electronic signals are supplied to these plates to trace or
paint a horizontal line.
</p><p class="paragraph">8. The Aquadag Coating—in the CRT, this coating performs the same function as the suppressor
grid in conventional tubes; namely, eliminating the effects of secondary emission. In
conventional tubes, the suppressor grid is negatively charged and repels secondary emission
electrons back to the plate. In the CRT, the aquadag is positively charged and attracts secondary
emission away from the screen.
</p><p class="paragraph">9. The Screen—also called the face, is a unique element of the CRT. When struck by electrons, the
phosphor coating becomes luminous, or glows, thus enabling the tube to visually present
electronic signals.
</p><p class="paragraph">From this comparison of the CRT and other types of electron tubes, one fact should be clear. Almost
all tubes, no matter what their function, operate on two principles: electrostatic attraction and repulsion,
and thermionic emission. By keeping these two principles in mind, you should be able to analyze any type
of tube operation.

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-SAFETY-2-29-">SAFETY
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are certain safety precautions you should follow when you work with or handle the special
tubes covered in this chapter. We will examine these tubes and their associated precautions in the
following sections.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-ELECTRON-TUBES-2-29-">ELECTRON TUBES
</h2><p class="paragraph">The average electron tube is a rugged device capable of withstanding the shocks and knocks of
everyday usage and handling. However, they are not indestructible. You should remember that most
electron tubes contain a near vacuum enclosed by a glass envelope. Because of this, the glass is under
constant stress from atmospheric pressure. Any undue stress, such as striking the envelope against a hard
surface, may cause the envelope to shatter, resulting in an IMPLOSION.
</p><p class="paragraph">An implosion is just the opposite of an explosion. When the glass envelope of an electron tube
shatters, the outside atmosphere rushes into the tube to fill the vacuum. As the air rushes into the tube, it</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>
<div class="page mainpage" id="97"><div class="centered">
            <div class="pagination">

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="pagenumber">2-30
</p><p class="paragraph">carries glass fragments of the envelope with it. Once these fragments reach the center of the tube, they
continue outward with considerable velocity. The result is similar to an explosion, in that the immediate
area surrounding the electron tube is filled with fast-moving glass fragments. You, as a nearby object,
may find yourself the target for many of these glass fragments. For this reason you should handle all
electron tubes with care.
</p><h3 class="subsection">CATHODE-RAY TUBES (CRTS)
Since most electron tubes are small, the possibility of them being a safety hazard is usually very
</h3><p class="paragraph">small. There are two exceptions to this: CRT’s and radioactive tubes.
</p><p class="paragraph">The glass envelope of a CRT encloses a high vacuum. Because of its large volume and surface area,
the force exerted on a CRT by atmospheric pressure is considerable. The total force on a 10-inch CRT
may exceed 4,000 pounds. Over 1000 pounds is exerted on the CRT face alone.
</p><p class="paragraph">When a CRT is broken, a large implosion usually occurs. Almost two tons of force hurl glass
fragments toward the center of the tube. At the same time, the electron gun is normally thrown forward
inside the tube. The face, because of its size, tends to move very slowly toward the center of the tube.
This presents one of the main hazards of a broken CRT. The electron gun passes through the center of the
tube with considerable force. It continues until it strikes the CRT face. The impact from the electron gun
normally breaks the CRT face into many small fragments, which are hurled outward. The face is coated
with a chemical coating that is extremely toxic. If you are unfortunate enough to experience an accidental
implosion of a CRT and are nicked by one of these fragments, seek immediate medical aid. As you can
see, improper handling of a CRT can be very hazardous to your health.
</p><p class="paragraph">The CRT is, in essence, a tiny fragmentation bomb. The major difference between a CRT and a
bomb is that a bomb is designed to explode; a CRT is not. As long as you handle a CRT properly, it
represents no danger to you. Only when you mishandle it do you risk the danger of being pelted with an
electron gun and toxic glass fragments. When handling a CRT, you should take the following precautions:
</p><p class="paragraph">1. Avoid scratching or striking the surface of the CRT.
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Do not use excessive force when you remove or replace a CRT’s deflection yoke or socket.
</p><p class="paragraph">3. Do not try to remove an electromagnetic-type CRT from its yoke until you have discharged the
high voltage from the CRT’s anode connector (hole).
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Never hold the CRT by its neck.
</p><p class="paragraph">5. Always set the CRT with its face down on a thick piece of felt, rubber, or smooth cloth.
</p><p class="paragraph">6. Always handle the CRT gently. Rough handling or a sharp blow on the service bench can
displace the electrodes within the tube, causing faulty operation.
</p><p class="paragraph">7. Wear safety glasses and protective gloves.
</p><p class="paragraph">One additional handling procedure you should be aware of is how to dispose of a CRT properly.
When you replace a CRT, you cannot simply throw the old CRT over the side of the ship, or place it in
the nearest dumpster. When thrown over the side of a ship, a CRT will float; if it washes ashore, it is
dangerous to persons who may come in contact with it. A CRT thrown in a dumpster represents a hidden
booby trap. Therefore, always render the CRT harmless before you dispose of it. This is a fairly simple
procedure, as outlined below.
</p><p class="paragraph">Note: Be sure to wear safety goggles.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">• Carefully break off the plastic locating pin from the base (fig. 2-29) by crushing the locating pin
with a pair of pliers.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Brush the broken plastic from the pin off the CRT base.
</p><p class="paragraph">• Look into the hole in the base where the locator pin was. You will see the glass extension of the
CRT called the vacuum seal. Grasp the vacuum seal near the end with the pliers and crush it.
</p><p class="paragraph">This may sound a little risky but it isn’t. The vacuum seal can be crushed without shattering the tube.
Once the seal has been crushed, air will rush into the tube and eliminate the vacuum.
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-RADIOACTIVE-ELECTRON-TUBES-2-31-">RADIOACTIVE ELECTRON TUBES
</h2><p class="paragraph">Another type of tube that can prove hazardous to you, if you handle it improperly, is the radioactive
tube.
</p><p class="paragraph">These tubes contain radioactive material and are used as voltage-regulator, gas-switching, and cold-
cathode, gas-rectifier tubes. Some of these tubes have dangerous radioactive intensity levels. Radioactive
tubes are marked according to military specifications.
</p><p class="paragraph">Radioactive material is added to a tube to aid in ionization. The radioactive material emits relatively
slowly moving particles. This should not worry you because the glass envelope is thick enough to keep
these particles inside the tube. Therefore, proper handling is nothing more than ensuring that the envelope
remains unbroken. If these tubes are broken and the radioactive material is exposed, or escapes from the
confines of the electron tube, the radioactive material becomes a potential hazard.
</p><p class="paragraph">The concentration of radioactivity in an average collection of electron tubes in a maintenance shop
does not approach a dangerous level, and the hazards of injury from exposure are slight. However, at
major supply points, the storage of large quantities of radioactive electron tubes in a relatively small area
may create a hazard. For this reason, personnel working with equipment using electron tubes containing
radioactive material, or in areas where a large quantity of radioactive tubes are stored, should read and
become thoroughly familiar with the safety practices contained in Radiation, Health, and Protection
Manual, NAVMED P-5055. Strict compliance with the prescribed safety precautions and procedures of
this manual will help to prevent accidents, and to maintain a safe working environment which is
conducive to good health.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">The clean-up procedures listed below are based on NAVMED P-5055. Your ship or station may
have additional procedures that you should follow. Be sure you are aware of your command’s policy
concerning decontamination procedures before you begin working on equipment containing radioactive
tubes. Some important instructions and precautions for the proper handling of radioactive tubes are listed
below:
</p><p class="paragraph"> 1. Do not remove radioactive tubes from their carton until you are ready to install them.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 2. When you remove a tube containing a radioactive material from equipment, place it immediately
in an appropriate carton to prevent possible breakage.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 3. Never carry a radioactive tube in a manner that may cause it to break.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 4. If a radioactive tube that you are handling or removing breaks, notify the proper authority and
obtain the services of qualified radiological personnel immediately.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 5. Isolate the immediate area of exposure to protect other personnel from possible contamination and
exposure.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 6. Follow the established procedures set forth in NAVMED P-5055.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 7. Do not permit contaminated material to come in contact with any part of your body.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 8. Take care to avoid breathing any vapor or dust that may be released by tube breakage.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 9. Wear rubber or plastic gloves at all times during cleanup and decontamination procedures.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 10. Use forceps to remove large fragments of a broken radioactive tube. Remove the remaining small
particles with a designated vacuum cleaner, using an approved disposal collection bag. If a
vacuum cleaner is not designated, use a wet cloth to wipe the affected area. In this case, be sure to
make one stroke at a time. DO NOT use a back-and-forth motion. After each stroke, fold the cloth
in half, always holding one clean side and using the other for the new stroke. Dispose of the cloth
in the manner stated in instruction 14 below.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 11. Do not bring food or drink into the contaminated area or near any radioactive material.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 12. Immediately after leaving a contaminated area, if you handled radioactive material in any way,
remove all of your clothing. Also wash your hands and arms thoroughly with soap and water, and
rinse with clean water.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 13. Notify a medical officer immediately if you sustain a wound from a sharp radioactive object. If a
medical officer cannot reach the scene immediately, stimulated mild bleeding by applying pressure
about the wound and by using suction bulbs. DO NOT USE YOUR MOUTH if the wound is a
puncture-type wound. If the opening is small, make an incision to promote free bleeding, and to
make the wound easier to clean and flush.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 14. When you clean a contaminated area, seal all debris, cleaning cloths, and collection bags in a
container such as a plastic bag, heavy wax paper, or glass jar, and place them in a steel can until
they can be disposed of according to existing instructions.
</p><p class="paragraph"> 15. Use soap and water to decontaminate all tools and implements you used to remove the radioactive
substance. Monitor the tools and implements for radiation with an authorized radiac set to ensure
that they are not contaminated.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">While conventional tubes present few safety problems, beyond broken glass and the possibility of
cutting yourself, there is one precaution you must know. Namely, electron tubes are hot. The filaments of
some tubes may operate at several thousand degrees. As a result, the envelopes can become very hot.
When you work on electron tube equipment, always deenergize the equipment and allow the tubes
sufficient time to cool before you remove them. If this is impossible, use special tube pullers which the
Navy stocks for this purpose. Never attempt to remove a hot tube from its socket with your bare fingers.
</p><h1 class="summary">SUMMARY
</h1><p class="paragraph">The following summary covers the main points of this chapter. Study it to be sure you understand the
material before you begin the next chapter.
</p><p class="paragraph">MULTI-UNIT TUBES were developed to reduce the size of vacuum tube circuits. Incorporating
more than one tube in the same envelope allowed the size of a vacuum tube circuit to be reduced
considerably. While a single envelope may contain two or more tubes, these tubes are independent of
each other.
</p><p class="paragraph">MULTI-ELECTRODE TUBES were developed to extend the capability of conventional tubes. In
some cases, a multi-element tube may contain up to seven grids. These types of tubes are normally
classified by the number of grids they contain.
</p><p class="paragraph">POWER PENTODES are used as current or power amplifiers. Power pentodes use in-line grid
arrangements. In this manner, more electrons can reach the plate from the cathode. In effect, this lowers
plate resistance and allows maximum conduction through the tube.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">BEAM-POWER TUBES are also used as power amplifiers. In addition to the in-line grid
arrangement, beam-power tubes use a set of negatively charged beam-forming plates. The beam-forming
plates force electrons that would normally be deflected from the plate back into the electron steam and,
thus, add to the number of electrons the tube can use for power amplification.
</p><p class="paragraph">VARIABLE-MU (µ) TUBES or REMOTE-CUTOFF TUBES were developed to extend the
amplification range of electron tubes by avoiding the possibility of driving the tube into cutoff. This is
done by uneven spacing of the grid wires.</p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><h3 class="subsection">In the early part of this century when electronics was first introduced, most electronic equipment was

</p><p class="paragraph">also placed several limitations on how the equipment could be used. Because of their general inefficiency, 
</p><p class="paragraph">batteries had to be either replaced frequently or, if they were rechargeable, kept near a battery charger. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Thus, the advantage of having portable equipment was more than offset by the need to replace or recharge 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the batteries frequently. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Users of electronic equipment needed a power supply that was reliable, convenient, and cost 
</h3><p class="paragraph">effective. Since batteries failed to satisfy these requirements, the "electronic power supply" was 
</p><p class="paragraph">developed. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">In today's Navy, all electronic equipment, both ashore and on board ship, require some type of power

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-THE-BASIC-POWER-SUPPLY-3-2-">THE BASIC POWER SUPPLY 
</h2><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-1 shows the block diagram of the basic power supply. Most power supplies are made up of 
</p><p class="paragraph">four basic sections: a TRANSFORMER, a RECTIFIER, a FILTER, and a REGULATOR. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As you can see, the first section is the TRANSFORMER. The transformer serves two primary 
purposes: (1) to step up or step down the input line voltage to the desired level and (2) to couple this 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltage to the rectifier section. The RECTIFIER section converts the ac signal to a pulsating dc voltage. 
However, you will see later in this chapter that the pulsating dc voltage is not desirable. For this reason, a 
</p><p class="paragraph">FILTER section is used to convert the pulsating dc voltage to filtered dc voltage. The final section, the 
REGULATOR, does just what the name implies. It maintains the output of the power supply at a 
constant level in spite of large changes in load current or in input line voltage. Depending upon the design 
</p><p class="paragraph">of the equipment, the output of the regulator will maintain a constant dc voltage within certain limits. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Now that you know what each section does, let's trace a signal through the power supply and see 
</h3><p class="paragraph">what changes are made to the input signal. In figure 3-2, the input signal of 120 volts ac is applied to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">primary of the transformer, which has a turns ratio of 1:3. We can calculate the output by multiplying the 
</p><p class="paragraph">input voltage by the ratio of turns in the secondary winding to turns in the primary winding. Therefore, 
</p><p class="paragraph">the output voltage of our example is: 120 volts ac × 3, or 360 volts ac. Depending on the type of rectifier 
</p><p class="paragraph">used (full-wave or half-wave), the output from the rectifier will be a portion of the input. Figure 3-2 
</p><p class="paragraph">shows the ripple waveform associated with a full-wave rectifier. The filter section contains a network of 
</p><h3 class="subsection">resistors, capacitors, or inductors that controls the rise and fall time of the varying signal so that the signal 
</h3><p class="paragraph">remains at a more constant dc level. You will see this more clearly in the discussion of the actual filter 
</p><p class="paragraph">circuits. You can see that the output of the filter is at a 180-volt dc level with an ac RIPPLE voltage 
riding on it. (Ripple voltage is a small ac voltage riding at some dc voltage level. Normally, ripple voltage 
</p><p class="paragraph">is an unwanted ac voltage created by the filter section of a power supply.) This signal now goes to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">regulator where it will be maintained at approximately 180 volts dc to the load.

</h2><h3 class="subsection">The transformer has several purposes: In addition to coupling the input ac signal to the power supply, 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">it also isolates the electronic power supply from the external power source and either steps up or steps 
</h3><p class="paragraph">down the ac voltage to the desired level. Additionally, most input transformers have separate step-down 
</p><h3 class="subsection">windings to supply filament voltages to both power supply tubes and the tubes in the external equipment 
</h3><p class="paragraph">(load). Such a transformer is shown in figure 3-3. Because the input transformer is located in the power 
</p><h3 class="subsection">supply and is the ultimate source of power for both the load and the power supply, it is called the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">POWER TRANSFORMER. Notice that the transformer has the ability to deliver both 6.3 and 5 volts ac 
filament voltages to the electron tubes. The High-voltage winding is a 1:3 step-up winding and delivers 
</p><p class="paragraph">360 volts ac to the rectifier. This transformer also has what is called a center tap. This center tap provides 
the capability of developing two high-voltage outputs from one transformer.

</h2><h3 class="subsection">From previous discussions, you know that rectification is the changing of an ac voltage to a pulsating 
</h3><p class="paragraph">dc voltage. Now let's discuss the process of rectification. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Since a diode vacuum tube will pass current in only one direction, it is ideally suited for converting 
</h3><p class="paragraph">alternating current to direct current. If an ac voltage is applied to a diode, the diode will conduct ONLY

positive with respect to the cathode. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-4 shows a diode connected across the 120-volt ac line. During the positive alternation of the

</p><h3 class="subsection">this time the diode conducts and plate current flows from the negative supply lead, through the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">milliammeter, through the tube, and to the positive supply lead. This is indicated by the shaded area of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">output waveform. This current exists during the entire period of time that the plate is positive with respect

</p><p class="paragraph">CUTOFF. This is indicated by the dotted waveform. The tube will be in cutoff and no current will flow 
for the entire negative alternation. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">For each 360-degree cycle of input voltage, the tube conducts for 180 degrees and is in cutoff for 180 
</h3><p class="paragraph">degrees. The circuit current therefore has the appearance of a series of positive pulses, as shown by the 
</p><p class="paragraph">shaded areas. Notice that although the current is in the form of pulses, the current always flows through 
</p><p class="paragraph">the circuit in THE SAME DIRECTION. Current that flows in pulses in the same direction is called 
PULSATING DC. The diode has thus RECTIFIED the input voltage. Although the principle of 
rectification applies to all rectifier circuits, some rectifiers are more efficient than others. For this reason, 
</p><h3 class="subsection">we will explain the three rectifier circuits most commonly used in electronics today-the half-wave, 
</h3><p class="paragraph">full-wave, and bridge. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">A Practical Half-Wave Rectifier 
</h3><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-5 is a diagram of a complete half-wave rectifier circuit. For the diode to be used as a

</p><p class="paragraph">two secondary windings mentioned earlier. The lower winding supplies high voltage to the plate and

</p><h3 class="subsection">the maximum voltage that appears across the load resistor is nearly, but never exceeds, 500 volts (because

</p><h3 class="subsection">A second advantage of the bridge rectifier is the low ratio of peak inverse voltage to average output

</p><p class="paragraph">In filter circuits the capacitor is the common element to both the charge and discharge paths. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, to obtain the longest possible discharge time, you want the capacitor to be as large as possible. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Another way to look at this is: The capacitor acts as a short circuit around the load (as far as the ac

</h3><p class="paragraph">The simple capacitor filter is the most basic type of power supply filter. The use of this filter is very 
</p><p class="paragraph">limited. It is sometimes used on extremely high-voltage, low-current power supplies for cathode-ray and 
</p><p class="paragraph">similar electron tubes that require very little load current from the supply. This filter is also used in 
</p><p class="paragraph">circuits where the power-supply ripple frequency is not critical and can be relatively high. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The simple capacitor filter shown in figure 3-20 consists of a single-filter element. This capacitor 
</p><p class="paragraph">(C1) is connected across the output of the rectifier in parallel with the load. The RC charge time of the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">filter capacitor (C1) must be short and the RC discharge time must be long to eliminate ripple action when 
</h3><p class="paragraph">using this filter. In other words, the capacitor must charge up fast with preferably no discharge at all. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Better filtering also results when the frequency is high; therefore, the full-wave rectifier output is easier to 
</h3><p class="paragraph">filter than the half-wave rectifier because of its higher frequency. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">To understand better the effect that filtering has on E avg, compare the rectifier circuits without filters 
</h3><p class="paragraph">in figure 3-21 to those with filters in figure 3-22. The output waveforms in figure 3-21 represent the 
</p><p class="paragraph">unfiltered outputs of the half-wave and full-wave rectifier circuits. Current pulses flow through the load

</p><h3 class="subsection">Another thing to keep in mind is that the ripple component (Er) of the output voltage is an ac voltage

</p><p class="paragraph">An LC choke-input filter is subject to several problems that can cause it to fail. The filter capacitors 
</p><p class="paragraph">are subject to open circuits, short circuits, and excessive leakage. The series inductor is subject to open

</p><h3 class="subsection">The filter capacitor in the choke-input filter circuit is not subject to extreme voltage surges because

</p><p class="paragraph">Shorted turns in the choke may reduce the value of inductance below the critical value. This will 
</p><h3 class="subsection">result in excessive peak-rectifier current, accompanied by an abnormally high output voltage, excessive 
</h3><p class="paragraph">ripple amplitude, and poor voltage regulation. A choke winding that is open, or a choke winding that is 
</p><p class="paragraph">shorted to the core will result in a no-output condition. A choke winding that is shorted to the core may 
</p><p class="paragraph">cause overheating of the rectifier element(s), blown fuses, and so forth. 
</p><p class="paragraph">To check the capacitor, first remove the supply voltage from the input to the filter circuit. Then 
</p><p class="paragraph">disconnect one terminal of the capacitor from the circuit. Check the capacitor with a capacitance analyzer 
</p><p class="paragraph">to determine its capacitance and leakage resistance. When the capacitor is electrolytic, be sure to use the

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The RC filter in figure 3-37 consists of an input filter capacitor (C1), a series resistor (R1), and an

</p><p class="paragraph">This filter is sometimes referred to as an RC pi-section filter because its schematic symbol resembles the

</p><p class="paragraph">An RC filter, such as a pi-section filter, does a much better job than a single capacitor filter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-37 illustrates an RC filter connected across the output of a rectifier. C1 performs the same 
</p><p class="paragraph">function that it did in the single capacitor filter. It is used to reduce the percentage of ripple to a relatively 
</p><p class="paragraph">low value. Thus, the voltage across C1 might consist of an average dc value of +100 volts with a ripple 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltage of 10 volts. This voltage is passed on to the R1-C2 network, which reduces the ripple even further 
</p><p class="paragraph">(view C). 
</p><p class="paragraph">C2 offers an infinite impedance (resistance) to the dc component of the output voltage. Thus, the dc 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltage is passed to the load, but reduced in value by the amount of the voltage drop across R1. However, 
</p><p class="paragraph">R1 is generally small compared to the load resistance. Therefore, the drop in the dc voltage by R1 is not a 
</p><p class="paragraph">drawback. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Component values are designed so that the resistance of R1 is much greater than the reactance of C2 
</h3><p class="paragraph">at the ripple frequency. C2 offers a very low impedance to the ac ripple frequency. Thus, the ac ripple 
</p><p class="paragraph">senses a voltage divider consisting of R1 and C2 between the output of the rectifier and ground. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, most of the ripple voltage is dropped across R1. Only a trace of the ripple voltage can be seen 
</p><p class="paragraph">across C2 and the load. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">In extreme cases where the ripple must be held to an absolute minimum, a second stage of RC

</p><p class="paragraph">because smaller capacitors can be used with good results. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The RC filter has some disadvantages, however. First, the voltage drop across R1 takes voltage away 
</p><p class="paragraph">from the load. Second, power is wasted in R1 and is dissipated in the form of unwanted heat. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Finally, if the load resistance changes, the voltage across the load will change. Even so, the 
</p><p class="paragraph">advantages of the RC filter overshadow these disadvantages in many cases. 
</p><p class="question">Q27. Is an RC filter used when a large current or a small current demand is required?

</p><h3 class="subsection">LC Capacitor-Input Filter 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The LC input filter is one of the most commonly used filters. This type of filter is used primarily in 
</p><h3 class="subsection">radio receivers, small audio amplifier power supplies, and in any type of power supply where the output 
</h3><p class="paragraph">current is low and the load current is relatively constant. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Figure 3-38 shows an LC capacitor-input filter and its associated waveforms. Both half-wave and 
</p><p class="paragraph">full-wave rectifier circuits are used to provide the inputs. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The waveforms shown in the figure represent the unfiltered output from a typical rectifier circuit. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Note again, that the average value of output voltage (Eavg) for the half-wave rectifier is less than half the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">amplitude of the voltage peaks. This is indicated by the dashed line. The average value of output voltage

</p><h3 class="subsection">(unfiltered), the waveform has a large value of pulsating component (ripple) as compared to the average 
</h3><p class="paragraph">(or dc) component. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A common type of LC filter is shown in figure 3-38. C1 performs the same functions as discussed 
</p><p class="paragraph">earlier by reducing the ripple to a relatively low level. L1 and C2 form the LC filter, which reduces the

</p><p class="paragraph">L1 is a large value iron-core inductor (choke.) It has a high value of inductance and, therefore, a high

</p><p class="paragraph">minimal. Thus, the LC filter overcomes the disadvantages of the RC filter. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Aside from the voltage divider effect, the inductor improves filtering in another way. You should 
</p><p class="paragraph">recall that an inductor resists changes in the magnitude of the current flowing through it. Consequently, 
</p><p class="paragraph">when the inductor is placed in series with the load, the inductor tends to hold the current steady. This, in 
</p><p class="paragraph">turn, helps to hold the voltage across the load constant. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The LC filter provides good filtering action over a wide range of currents. The capacitor filters best 
</p><p class="paragraph">when the load is drawing little current. Thus, the capacitor discharges very slowly and the output voltage 
</p><p class="paragraph">remains almost constant. On the other hand, the inductor filters best when the current is highest. The 
</p><h3 class="subsection">complementary nature of these components ensures good filtering over a wide range of current when size 
</h3><p class="paragraph">of components is a factor. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The LC filter has two disadvantages. The first is cost. The LC filter is more expensive than the RC 
</p><p class="paragraph">filter because its iron-core choke costs more than the resistor of the RC filter. The second disadvantage is 
</p><p class="paragraph">size, since the iron-core choke is bulky and heavy. Thus, the LC filter may be unsuitable for some 
</p><p class="paragraph">applications but is still one of the most widely used. 
</p><p class="question">Q30. What is the most commonly used filter in use today? 
</p><p class="question">Q31. What are the two main disadvantages of an LC capacitor filter? 
</p><p class="paragraph">Several problems may cause the LC capacitor filter to fail. Shunt capacitors are subject to open 
</p><h3 class="subsection">circuits, short circuits, and excessive leakage; series inductors are subject to open windings and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">occasionally shorted turns or a short circuit to the core. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The input capacitor (C1) has the greatest pulsating voltage applied to it, is the most susceptible to

</p><p class="paragraph">frequently subject to voltage breakdown and shorting. The output capacitor (C2) is not as susceptible to 
</p><h3 class="subsection">voltage surges because of the series protection offered by the series inductor (L1), but the capacitor can 
</h3><p class="paragraph">become open, leaky, or shorted. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">A shorted capacitor, an open filter choke, or a choke winding that is shorted to the core, results in a 
</h3><p class="paragraph">no-output indication. A shorted capacitor, depending on the magnitude of the short, may cause a shorted 
</p><p class="paragraph">rectifier, transformer, or filter choke and result in a blown fuse in the primary of the transformer. An open 
</p><h3 class="subsection">filter choke results in an abnormally high dc voltage at the input to the filter and no voltage at the output 
</h3><p class="paragraph">of the filter. A leaky or open capacitor in the filter circuit results in a low dc output voltage. This 
</p><p class="paragraph">condition is generally accompanied by an excessive ripple amplitude. Shorted turns in the winding of a 
</p><p class="paragraph">filter choke reduce the effective inductance of the choke and decrease its filtering efficiency. As a result, 
</p><p class="paragraph">the ripple amplitude increases.

</h2><p class="paragraph">Ideally, the output of most power supplies should be a constant voltage. Unfortunately, this is 
</p><p class="paragraph">difficult to achieve. There are two factors that can cause the output voltage to change. First, the ac line 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltage is not constant. The so-called 115 volts ac can vary from about 105 volts ac to 125 volts ac. This 
means that the peak ac voltage to which the rectifier responds can vary from about 148 volts to 177 volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The ac line voltage alone can be responsible for nearly a 20 percent change in the dc output voltage.

</p><h3 class="subsection">You should be able to see that as the input voltage decreases, the resistance of the variable resistor Rv 
</h3><p class="paragraph">decreases almost simultaneously, thereby compensating for the voltage drop. Since there is a smaller 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltage drop across Rv, the output voltage remains almost constant. Voltage fluctuations within the circuit 
</p><p class="paragraph">occur in microseconds. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Shunt Voltage Regulator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">The diagram in figure 3-42 represents a shunter voltage regulator. Notice that variable resistor Rv is 
</p><p class="paragraph">in parallel with the load resistance RL and that fixed resistor RS is in series with the load resistance. You 
</p><h3 class="subsection">already know the voltage drop across a fixed resistor remains constant unless there is a variation (increase 
</h3><p class="paragraph">or decrease) in the current through it. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">In a shunt regulator as shown in figure 3-42, output voltage regulation is determined by the current 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">through the parallel resistances of the regulating device (Rv), the load resistance (RL), and the series 
</h3><p class="paragraph">resistor (RS). For now, assume that the circuit in figure 3-42 is operating under normal conditions, that the 
</p><p class="paragraph">input is 120 volts dc, and that the desired regulated output is 100 volts dc. For a 100-volt output to be 
</p><p class="paragraph">maintained, 20 volts must be dropped across the series resistor (RS). If you assume that the value of RS is 
</p><p class="paragraph">2 ohms, then you must have 10 amperes of current through Rv and RL. (Remember: E = IR.) If the values 
of the resistance of Rv and RL are equal, then 5 amperes of current will flow through each resistance (Rv 
</p><p class="paragraph">and RL). 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">Now, if the load resistance (RL) increases, the current through RL will decrease. For example, assume 
</p><p class="paragraph">that the current through RL is now 4 amperes and that the total current through RS is 9 amperes. With this 
</p><h3 class="subsection">drop in current, the voltage drop across RS is 18 volts; consequently, the output of the regulator has 
</h3><p class="paragraph">increased to 102 volts. At this time, the regulating device (Rv) decreases in resistance, and 6 amperes of 
</p><p class="paragraph">current flows through this resistance (Rv). Thus, the total current through RS is once again 10 amperes (6 
</p><h3 class="subsection">amperes across Rv, 4 amperes through RL); therefore, 20 volts will be dropped across RS causing the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">output to decrease back to 100 volts. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><h3 class="subsection">You should know by now that if the load resistance (RL) increases, the regulating device (Rv) 
</h3><p class="paragraph">decreases its resistance to compensate for the change. If RL decreases, the opposite effect will occur and 
</p><p class="paragraph">Rv will increase. Now take a look at the circuit when a decrease in load resistance takes place. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When RL decreases, the current through RL subsequently increases to 6 amperes. This action causes a 
</p><p class="paragraph">total of 11 amperes to flow through RS which now drops 22 volts. As a result, the output is now 98 volts. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">However, the regulating device (Rv) senses this change and increases its resistance so that less current (4 
</h3><p class="paragraph">amperes) flows through Rv. The total current again becomes 10 amperes, and the output is again 100 
</p><p class="paragraph">volts. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">From these examples, you should now understand that the shunt regulator maintains the desired 
</h3><p class="paragraph">output voltage by sensing the current change that occurs in the parallel resistance of the circuit. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Again refer to the schematic shown in figure 3-42 and consider how the voltage regulator operates to 
</h3><p class="paragraph">compensate for changes in input voltages. You know, of course, that the input voltage may vary and that 
</p><p class="paragraph">any variation must be compensated for by the regulating device. Consider an increase in input voltage. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">When this happens the resistance of Rv automatically decreases to maintain the correct voltage division 
</h3><p class="paragraph">between Rv and RS. You should see, therefore, that the regulator operates in the opposite way to 
</p><p class="paragraph">compensate for a decrease in input voltage. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">So far we have explained the operation of voltage regulators that use variable resistors; however, this 
</h3><p class="paragraph">type of regulation has limitations. Obviously, the variable resistor cannot be adjusted rapidly enough to 
</p><p class="paragraph">compensate for frequent fluctuations in voltage. Since input voltages fluctuate frequently and rapidly, the 
</p><p class="paragraph">variable resistor is not a practical method for voltage regulation. A voltage regulator that operates 
</p><p class="paragraph">continuously and automatically to regulate the output voltage without external manipulation is required.

</p><h3 class="subsection">According to Ohm's law, the value of the load resistance for this circuit figure will be 900 ohms if a 
</h3><p class="paragraph">current of 100 milliamperes flows through RL. The internal resistance of the VR tube can be calculated in 
</p><p class="paragraph">a similar manner. With 22.5 milliamperes flowing and 90 volts dropped across the VR tube, its resistance 
</p><p class="paragraph">is 4 kilohms. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">To determine the voltage regulation in the circuit for figure 3-44, assume a constant supply voltage 
</h3><p class="paragraph">of 150 volts and a variable load resistance. If the value of RL were to decrease to 857 ohms, the load 
</p><p class="paragraph">current would increase to approximately 105 milliamperes to maintain 90 volts across the load resistance. 
</p><p class="paragraph">RS must drop 60 volts. To do so requires a current of 122.5 milliamperes flowing through the series 
</p><p class="paragraph">resistance. Since 105 milliamperes is now flowing through the load, the current through the VR tube must 
</p><p class="paragraph">decrease from 22.5 milliamperes to 17.5 milliamperes. We will discuss the sequence of events in more 
</p><p class="paragraph">detail to help you better understand how the tube current is made to vary. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The original load resistance was 900 ohms. Changes in this resistance will not occur instantaneously, 
</p><p class="paragraph">but will require some time to vary from 900 ohms to a new value. As resistance of the load begins to 
</p><p class="paragraph">decrease, load current begins to increase. The minute increase in load current will flow through the series 
</p><p class="paragraph">resistance RS causing a slight increase in ERS. This slight increase in voltage across RS will result in the 
</p><p class="paragraph">VR tube voltage dropping slightly. This slight drop in tube voltage will cause a decrease in the ionization 
</p><p class="paragraph">of the tube gas, which in turn increases the resistance of the tube. As a result, less current flows through 
</p><p class="paragraph">the tube. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Note that tube current can decrease only to a value of 5 milliamperes before deionization occurs. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, the load current cannot exceed 117.5 milliamperes, for beyond this value, tube current 
</p><p class="paragraph">becomes less than 5 milliamperes and regulation ceases. 
</p><p class="paragraph">If load resistance were to increase, load current would decrease. This would result in the VR tube 
</p><p class="paragraph">current increasing to maintain a current of 122.5 milliamperes. The VR tube current can only increase to 
</p><p class="paragraph">40 milliamperes. Beyond this value of current, the tube enters the abnormal glow region and tube voltage 
</p><p class="paragraph">increases. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The upper limit of the VR tube current will occur when load current decreases to a value of 82.5 
</p><p class="paragraph">milliamperes. When load current drops below this value, the VR tube ceases to regulate the load voltage. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Therefore, with a constant source voltage but variable load resistance, the limits of regulation will be 
</h3><p class="paragraph">reached when current in the load exceeds 117.5 milliamperes or drops below 82.5 milliamperes. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The VR tube regulator can also compensate for changes in power supply voltage. Under these 
</p><p class="paragraph">conditions, the load resistance will remain constant while the power supply voltage will be variable. Refer 
</p><p class="paragraph">to figure 3-44 for the following discussion. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Assume that the source voltage begins to increase from an original value of 150 volts toward 155 
</h3><p class="paragraph">volts. As this voltage increases, current through RS increases from its original value of 122.5 
</p><p class="paragraph">milliamperes. Initially, this additional current is drawn from the load, causing a slight increase in load 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltage. This increase in load voltage is felt across the VR tube and causes an increase in tube ionization. 
</p><p class="paragraph">This decreases the internal resistance of the VR tube with a resultant increase in tube current. When 
</p><p class="paragraph">source voltage reaches 155 volts, current through RS is approximately 133 milliamperes (RS = 490 ohms). 
</p><p class="paragraph">Most of the additional current through RS flows through the VR tube. As a result, approximately 33 
</p><p class="paragraph">milliamperes flows through the VR tube, maintaining the load voltage at 90 volts. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Since VR tube current decreases as source voltage decreases, tube current will drop below its lower 
</h3><p class="paragraph">limit of 5 milliamperes at some point. When source voltage drops below 141.4 volts, tube current will be 
</p><p class="paragraph">less than 5 milliamperes and regulation will cease. The upper and lower limits of the supply voltage 
</p><p class="paragraph">variations that can be allowed and still provide regulation in the circuit are 158.6 volts and 141.4 volts, </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">change is less than that which would exist without the use of a VR tube. 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the source voltage increases, the current through the VR tube increases. Since the upper limit of 
</p><p class="paragraph">tube current is 40 milliamperes, there is a limit in the ability of the tube to regulate increasing voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph">When the supply voltage exceeds 158.6 volts, tube current will be greater than 40 milliamperes and

</p><p class="paragraph">drop is 112 milliamperes. Since load current is 100 milliamperes, the remaining 12 milliamperes must 
</p><p class="paragraph">flow through the VR tube. This represents a decrease in the ionization level of the VR tube, with a 
</p><p class="paragraph">resultant increase in tube resistance. Under these conditions, 90 volts will be maintained across the load

</p><h3 class="subsection">VR Tubes Connected in Series

</p><h2 class="section" id="section-CURRENT-REGULATION-3-46-">CURRENT REGULATION 
</h2><h3 class="subsection">Before we go to the next section, there is one type of regulation that we should discuss-current 
</h3><p class="paragraph">regulation. In most power supplies, current is not regulated directly. Fuses and other circuit protection 
</p><p class="paragraph">devices are used to set an upper limit on the amount of current that can flow in a power supply. Once this 
</p><p class="paragraph">limit is exceeded, the fuse simply opens and the power supply is deenergized. Beyond this, current is 
</p><h3 class="subsection">usually left unregulated because the load will draw from the power supply only the amount of current that 
</h3><p class="paragraph">it needs. Decreases and increases in the power supply voltage caused by the variations in load current are 
</p><p class="paragraph">usually controlled by the voltage regulator. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The Amperite Regulator 
</h3><p class="paragraph">There are some cases in which current must be regulated or kept at a relatively constant value. The 
</p><h3 class="subsection">best example of this is the filament supply of a power transformer located in a power supply that is 
</h3><p class="paragraph">designed to supply filament power to many tubes. You can see this in view (A) of figure 3-49, which is a 
</p><p class="paragraph">portion of a power supply designed to supply 50 vacuum tubes with both plate and filament voltages. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Under normal conditions, circuit current will not exceed 2.5 amperes. For this reason, the power supply 
</p><p class="paragraph">has been fused at 3 amperes. Because you are only interested in current regulation at this time, only the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">portion of the power supply that deals with current regulation is shown; namely, the power transformer 
</h3><p class="paragraph">and four of the 50 parallel connected vacuum-tube filaments. At operating temperatures, the resistance of 
</p><p class="paragraph">each filament is 1 kilohm. Because the filaments are connected in parallel, the total filament resistance at 
</p><p class="paragraph">operating temperature is 20 ohms. Ohm's law,

</p><p class="paragraph">tells you that the filaments draw .315 amperes. You should know from your previous study that as 
</p><p class="paragraph">conductors are heated, their resistance increases. Therefore, the cold resistance of the filaments is 
</p><p class="paragraph">considerably lower than the hot resistance. In this case, assume 100 ohms per filament. The total 
</p><h3 class="subsection">resistance of the 50 parallel filaments is then 2 ohms when the power supply is first energized, and the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">filaments draw 3.15 amperes of current. If the current for the rest of the power supply is added to the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">filament current, the surge current will cause the power supply to draw 5 amperes when it is first 
</h3><p class="paragraph">energized. Unfortunately, the power supply is fused at 3 amperes. Under these conditions, it would be 
</p><h3 class="subsection">impossible to keep the power supply on the line long enough to get the filaments up to operating 
</h3><p class="paragraph">temperature. 
</p><p class="paragraph">There are three possible solutions to this problem. The first is simply to fuse the power supply at 5 
</p><p class="paragraph">amperes, but this could allow excessive current to flow in the power supply. Another solution is to use a 
</p><p class="paragraph">slow-blow fuse. Unfortunately, the duration of the current surge may exceed the time limit that a slow-
</p><p class="paragraph">blow fuse can handle. Therefore, current regulation is the best solution to this problem. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Because of its quick-heating ability, the amperite tube is ideal as a current regulator. The amperite 
</p><p class="paragraph">regulator is nothing more than an iron wire enclosed in a hydrogen-filled envelope. Because of its 
</p><p class="paragraph">construction, the iron filament will heat quickly when current is applied to it. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">View (B) of figure 3-49 shows the amperite regulator connected in series with the filaments of the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">load. When the power supply is first energized, the iron wire of the amperite gets hot quickly and presents 
</p><p class="paragraph">a large resistance connected in series with the 2 ohms of filament resistance. As a result, most of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltage is dropped across the amperite. Because of the large resistance of the amperite regulator, current 
</p><p class="paragraph">in the circuit is held to an acceptable level in accordance with Ohm's law: 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As the filaments warm up, their resistance increases, which causes circuit current to decrease. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">decreasing circuit current allows the iron wire of the amperite to cool. As it cools, its resistance decreases 
</p><p class="paragraph">until it reaches the approximate resistance of the circuit wiring. You might think that decreasing the 
</p><p class="paragraph">resistance of the amperite would allow circuit current to increase again, but this does not happen. As the 
</p><h3 class="subsection">iron wire of the amperite cools and its resistance decreases, the resistance of the warming tube filaments 
</h3><p class="paragraph">increases. Throughout the entire heating cycle of the filaments, the total resistance of the series circuit, 
</p><p class="paragraph">consisting of the amperite and tube filaments, remains fairly constant. When power is first applied, most 
</p><p class="paragraph">of the resistance is in the amperite. Therefore, most of the voltage is dropped across the resistance of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">amperite. Halfway through the cycle, the resistance of the amperite and the resistance of the filaments are 
</p><p class="paragraph">approximately equal, and the voltage drops across the two series elements are equal. Finally, when the 
</p><p class="paragraph">filaments have reached their operating temperature, most of the resistance is in the filaments of the tube. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Therefore, most of the voltage is dropped across the tube filaments. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">The important thing to note is that the total circuit resistance remains approximately the same 
</h3><p class="paragraph">throughout the heating cycle. As the cycle progresses, the resistance of the amperite decreases as the 
</p><p class="paragraph">resistance of the tube filaments increases. Because resistance and voltage (6.3 volts) remain constant, 
</p><h3 class="subsection">current remains constant, except for the slight surge in the beginning of the heating cycle, which is 
</h3><p class="paragraph">necessary to heat up the iron wire of the amperite. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Now that we have discussed the different types of regulators, you should be able to see that there are 
</h3><p class="paragraph">many variables that affect good regulation. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Although you may not be required to design regulators, you will be required to maintain them 
</h3><p class="paragraph">because your electronic equipment depends upon good regulation to operate property. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</h2><p class="paragraph">Whenever you work with electricity, you must follow all the appropriate safety precautions. In the 
front of all electronic technical manuals, you will always find a section on safety precautions. You should 
</p><p class="paragraph">also find posted on each piece of equipment a sign listing the specific precautions for that equipment. One 
</p><p class="paragraph">hazardous area that is sometimes overlooked, especially on board ship, is grounding of equipment. By 
</p><h3 class="subsection">grounding the return side of the power transformer to the metal chassis, manufacturers can wire the 
</h3><h3 class="subsection">cathodes of the tubes in both the power supply and the load being supplied by the power supply directly 
</h3><p class="paragraph">to the metal chassis. This eliminates the necessity of wiring each tube directly to the return side of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">transformer, saving wire, and reducing the cost of building the equipment. While this solves one of the 
</p><p class="paragraph">problems of the manufacturer, it creates a problem for you, the technician. Unless the chassis is physically 
</p><h3 class="subsection">grounded to the ship's ground (the hull), the chassis can be charged (or can float) several hundred volts 
</h3><p class="paragraph">above ship's ground. If you come in contact with the metal chassis at the same time you are in contact 
</p><h3 class="subsection">with the ship's hull, the current from the chassis can use your body as a low resistance path back to the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">ship's ac generators. At best this can be an unpleasant experience; at worst it can be fatal. For this reason 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Navy electronic equipment is always grounded to the ship's hull, and approved rubber mats are required 
</h3><p class="paragraph">in all spaces where electronic equipment is present. Therefore, before you start to work on any electronic 
</p><h3 class="subsection">or electrical equipment ALWAYS ENSURE THAT THE EQUIPMENT AND ANY TEST EQUIPMENT 
</h3><h2 class="section" id="section-YOU-ARE-USING-IS-PROPERLY-GROUNDED-AND-THAT-THE-RUBBER-MAT-YOU-ARE-3-48-">YOU ARE USING IS PROPERLY GROUNDED AND THAT THE RUBBER MAT YOU ARE 
</h2><p class="paragraph">STANDING ON IS IN GOOD CONDITION. As long as you follow these simple rules, you should be 
</p><p class="paragraph">able to avoid the possibility of becoming an electrical conductor. 
</p><h2 class="section" id="section-TESTING-3-48-">TESTING 
</h2><p class="paragraph">There are two widely used checks in testing electronic equipment. The first is the VISUAL 
CHECK. Do not underestimate the importance of this check. Many technicians find defects right away 
simply by looking for them. A visual check does not take long; in fact you should be able to see the 
</p><p class="paragraph">problem in about 2 minutes if it is the kind of problem that can be seen. You should learn the following 
</p><p class="paragraph">procedure. You will find yourself using it quite often, as it is good not only for power supplies but also 
</p><p class="paragraph">for any other type of electronic equipment you may be troubleshooting. 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. BEFORE YOU PLUG IN THE EQUIPMENT, LOOK FOR: 
</p><p class="paragraph">a. LOOSE TUBESA tube that is not properly seated in its socket may not be making proper 
</p><p class="paragraph">contact with the rest of the circuit. It may very well be the source of your problem. Push the 
</p><p class="paragraph">tube completely into place. 
</p><p class="paragraph">b. SHORTSExamine any terminal or connection that is close to the chassis or to any other 
</p><p class="paragraph">terminal for the possibility of a short. A short in any part of the power supply can cause 
</p><p class="paragraph">considerable damage. Look for and remove any stray drops of solder, bits of wire, nuts, or 
</p><p class="paragraph">screws. It sometimes helps to shake the chassis and listen for any tell-tale rattles. Remember 
</p><p class="paragraph">to correct any problem that may cause a short circuit. If it is not causing trouble now, it may 
</p><p class="paragraph">cause problems in the future. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

            </div></div><div class="imageblock"></div><p class="paragraph"></p><p class="paragraph"> </p><p class="pagenumber">3-49 
</p><p class="paragraph">c. DISCOLORED OR LEAKING TRANSFORMERThis is a sure sign that there is a short 
</p><p class="paragraph">somewhere. Locate it. If the equipment has a fuse, find out why the fuse did not blow; too 
</p><p class="paragraph">large a size may have been installed, or there may be a short across the fuse holder. 
</p><p class="paragraph">d. LOOSE, BROKEN, OR CORRODED CONNECTIONSAny connection that is not in good 
</p><p class="paragraph">condition is a trouble spot If it is not causing problems now, it probably will in the future. Fix 
</p><p class="paragraph">it. 
</p><p class="paragraph">e. DAMAGED RESISTORS OR CAPACITORSA resistor that is discolored or charred has 
</p><p class="paragraph">been subjected to an overload. An electrolytic capacitor will show a whitish deposit at the 
</p><p class="paragraph">seal around the terminals. Check for a short whenever you notice a damaged resistor or 
</p><p class="paragraph">capacitor. If there is no short, the trouble may be that the power supply has been overloaded 
</p><p class="paragraph">in some way. Make a note to replace the part after signal tracing. There is no sense in risking 
</p><p class="paragraph">a new part until you have located the trouble. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. PLUG IN THE POWER SUPPLY AND LOOK FOR: 
</p><p class="paragraph">a. SMOKING PARTSIf any part smokes or if you hear any boiling or sputtering sounds, pull 
</p><p class="paragraph">the plug immediately. There is a short circuit somewhere that you have missed in your first 
</p><p class="paragraph">inspection. Use an ohmmeter to check the part again; begin in neighborhood of the smoking 
</p><p class="paragraph">part. 
</p><p class="paragraph">b. COLD TUBESAfter allowing the equipment about two minutes for warm-up, touch all the 
</p><p class="paragraph">tubes. If a tube is cold, it is either burned out or there is a break in the heater connections and 
</p><p class="paragraph">the tube is not receiving proper heater voltage. Remove the tube and connect an ohmmeter 
</p><p class="paragraph">across the heater terminals to see if the filament is open (reads almost infinite resistance). If 
</p><p class="paragraph">the filament reads open, it is burned out. Replace the bad tube with a good one. If the 
</p><p class="paragraph">filament reads a low resistance, this indicates that the filament is all right. Use an ac 
</p><p class="paragraph">voltmeter to find the break between the filament and the output of the transformer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">c. SPARKINGTap or shake the chassis. If you see or hear sparking, you have located a loose 
</p><p class="paragraph">connection or a short. Check and repair the problem. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">If you locate and repair any of the defects listed under the visual check, make a note of what you find 
</h3><p class="paragraph">and what you do to correct it. It is quite probable you have found the trouble. However, a good technician 
</p><p class="paragraph">takes nothing for granted. You must prove to yourself that the equipment is operating properly and that no 
</p><p class="paragraph">other troubles exist. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">If you find none of the defects listed under the visual check, go ahead with the signal tracing 
</h3><p class="paragraph">procedure. The trouble is probably of such a nature that you cannot see it directly with your eye-you must 
</p><p class="paragraph">see it through the eye of the oscilloscope. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The second type of testing is signal tracing. Tracing the ac signal through the equipment is the most 
</p><p class="paragraph">rapid method of locating a trouble that you cannot find by a visual check. It also serves as a check on any 
</p><p class="paragraph">repairs you may have made. The idea is to trace the ac voltage from the transformer, to see it change to 
</p><p class="paragraph">pulsating dc at the rectifier tube filament, and then to see the pulsations smoothed out by the filter. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">point where the signal stops or becomes distorted is the place to look for the trouble. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Before you begin signal tracing, it is a good idea to measure the dc voltage. The dc output voltage 
</p><p class="paragraph">should be in the neighborhood of 340 volts. If you have no dc output voltage, you should look for an open 
</p><p class="paragraph">or a short in your signal tracing. If you have a low dc voltage, you should look for a defective part and 
</p><p class="paragraph">keep your eyes open for the place where the signal becomes distorted. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">Signal tracing is done by observing the waveform at the input and output of each part of a circuit. It 
</p><p class="paragraph">is the method used to localize trouble in a circuit. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Let's review what each part of a good power supply does to the signal, as shown in figure 3-50. The 
</p><p class="paragraph">ac voltage is brought in from the power line through the line cord. This voltage is connected to the 
</p><p class="paragraph">primary of the transformer through the ON-OFF switch (S1). At the secondary winding of the 
transformer (points 1 and 2), the scope shows you a picture of the stepped-up voltage developed across 
</p><p class="paragraph">each half of the secondary windingthe picture is that of a complete sine wave. Each of the two stepped-
</p><p class="paragraph">up voltages is connected between ground and one of the two plates of the rectifier tube. At the two 
</p><h3 class="subsection">rectifier plates (points 4 and 5) there is still no change in the shape of the stepped-up voltage the scope

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">However, when you look at the scope pattern for point 6 (the voltage at the rectifier heater), you see 
</h3><p class="paragraph">the wave shape for pulsating direct current. This pulsating dc is fed through the first choke (L1) and filter 
</p><p class="paragraph">capacitor (C1), which remove a large part of the ripple or "hum," as shown by the waveform for point 7. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Finally, the dc voltage is fed through the second choke (L2) and filter capacitor (C2), which remove 
</h3><p class="paragraph">nearly all of the remaining ripple. See the waveform for point 8, which shows almost no visible ripple. 
</p><p class="paragraph">You now have almost pure dc.

</p><p class="paragraph">troubles that you should keep in mind. The meaning of each trouble will be clear by the time you end 
</p><p class="paragraph">your study of vacuum tubes, even though you may not quite understand them now. 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. The filament, after long service, may be unable to emit as many electrons as are required for 
</p><p class="paragraph">proper operation. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. The filament may burn out. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. A tube element-the plate, for instance-may break its connection with the tube base pin. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Two elements, such as filament and plate, may short together. 
</p><p class="paragraph">5. The tube may become gassy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">The symptoms you will come across in signal tracing will be many and varied. You will need to 
</p><h3 class="subsection">combine your "know-how" of the circuit and your knowledge of these five possible tube troubles to 
</h3><p class="paragraph">determine if the tube could in some way be causing the symptoms. If you suspect the tube of causing 
</p><p class="paragraph">trouble, either try another tube in its place or check it on a tube tester. But remember, the final check of 
</p><h3 class="subsection">whether or not the old tube was bad is whether or not the equipment works properly when a good tube is 
</h3><p class="paragraph">put in its place. Therefore, putting in a good tube and then trying out the equipment is the best check. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">Transformer and Choke Troubles 
</h3><p class="paragraph">As you should know by now, the transformer and choke are quite similar in construction. Therefore, 
</p><p class="paragraph">it is no coincidence that the basic troubles they can develop are the same. 
</p><p class="paragraph">1. A winding can open. 
</p><p class="paragraph">2. Two or more turns of one winding can short together. 
</p><p class="paragraph">3. A winding can short to the casing, which is usually grounded. 
</p><p class="paragraph">4. Two windings can short together. This trouble is possible, of course, only in transformers. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">As with the tube, the symptoms of these troubles will vary with the type of circuit. However, when 
</p><h3 class="subsection">you have decided that one of these four possible troubles could be causing the symptoms, there are 
</h3><p class="paragraph">definite steps to take. If you surmise that there is an open winding or windings shorted together or to 
</p><p class="paragraph">ground, an ohmmeter continuity check will locate the trouble. If the turns of a winding are shorted 
</p><p class="paragraph">together, you may not be able to detect a difference in winding resistance. Therefore, you need to connect 
</p><h3 class="subsection">a good transformer in the place of the old one and see if the symptoms are eliminated; but keep in mind 
</h3><p class="paragraph">that transformers are difficult to replace. Make absolutely sure that the trouble is not elsewhere in the 
</p><p class="paragraph">circuit before you change the transformer. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Occasionally, shorts will appear only when operating voltages are applied to the transformer. In this 
</p><h3 class="subsection">case you might find the trouble with a meggeran instrument that applies a high voltage as it reads 
</h3><p class="paragraph">resistance. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><h3 class="subsection">You can check a capacitor you suspect of being open by disconnecting it from the circuit and 
</h3><p class="paragraph">checking it with a capacitor analyzer. You can check a capacitor you suspect of being leaky with an 
</p><p class="paragraph">ohmmeter; if it reads less than 500 kilohms, it is more than likely bad. However, capacitor troubles are 
</p><p class="paragraph">difficult to find since they may appear intermittently or only under operating voltages. Therefore, the best 
</p><p class="paragraph">check for a faulty capacitor is to replace it with one you know to be good. If this restores proper

</h1><h3 class="subsection">In this chapter, we have presented you a basic description of the theory and operation of a basic 
</h3><p class="paragraph">power supply and its components. The following summary should enhance your understanding of power 
</p><p class="paragraph">supplies. 
</p><p class="paragraph">POWER SUPPLIES are electronic circuits designed to convert ac to dc at any desired level. Almost 
all power supplies are composed of four sections: transformer, rectifier, filter, and regulator. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The POWER TRANSFORMER is the input transformer for the power supply. In addition to the 
high voltage, the power transformer also supplies filament voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The RECTIFIER is the section of the power supply that contains the secondary windings of the 
power transformer and the rectifier circuit. The rectifier uses the ability of a diode to conduct during one 
</p><p class="paragraph">half cycle of ac to convert ac to dc. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph">HALF-WAVE RECTIFIERS give an output on only one half cycle of the input ac. For this reason, 
the pulses of dc are separated by a period of one half cycle of zero potential voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">FULL-WAVE RECTIFIERS conduct on both halves of the input ac cycles. As a result, the dc 
pulses are not separated from each other. A characteristic of full-wave rectifiers is the use of a center-
</p><p class="paragraph">tapped, high-voltage secondary. Because of the center tap, the output of the rectifier is limited to one-half 
</p><p class="paragraph">of the input voltage of the high-voltage secondary. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">BRIDGE RECTIFIERS are full-wave rectifiers that do not use a center-tapped, high-voltage 
secondary. Because of this their dc output voltage is equal to the input voltage from the high-voltage 
</p><p class="paragraph">secondary of the power transformer. Bridge rectifiers use four diodes connected in a bridge network. 
</p><p class="paragraph">Tubes conduct in diagonal pairs to give a full-wave pulsating dc output. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">FILTER CIRCUITS are designed to smooth, or filter, the ripple voltage present on the pulsating dc 
output of the rectifier. This is done by an electrical device that has the ability to store energy and to 
</p><p class="paragraph">release the stored energy. 
</p><p class="paragraph">CAPACITANCE FILTERS are nothing more than large capacitors placed across the output of the 
rectifier section. Because of the large size of the capacitors, fast charge paths, and slow discharge paths, 
</p><h3 class="subsection">the capacitor will charge to average value, which will keep the pulsating dc output from reaching zero 
</h3><p class="paragraph">volts. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">INDUCTOR FILTERS use an inductor called a choke to filter the pulsating dc input. Because of 
the impedance offered to circuit current, the output of the filter is at a lower amplitude than the input. </p><p class="paragraph"></p></div>

</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">PI-TYPE FILTERS use both capacitive and inductive filters connected in a pi-type configuration. 
Because of the combination of filtering devices, the ability of the pi filter to remove ripple voltage is 
</p><p class="paragraph">superior to that of either the capacitance or inductance filter. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">VOLTAGE REGULATORS are circuits designed to maintain the output of power supplies at a 
constant amplitude despite variations of the ac source voltage or changes of the resistance of the load. 
</p><h3 class="subsection">This is done by creating a voltage divider of a resistive element in the regulator and the resistance of the 
</h3><p class="paragraph">load. Regulation is achieved by varying the resistance of the resistive element in the regulator. 
</p><p class="paragraph">A SERIES REGULATOR uses a variable resistance in series with the load. Regulation is achieved 
by varying this resistance either to increase or decrease the voltage drop across the resistive element of 
</p><p class="paragraph">the regulator. Characteristically, the resistance of the variable resistance moves in the same direction as 
</p><p class="paragraph">the load. When the resistance of the load increases, the variable resistance of the regulator increases; 
</p><p class="paragraph">when load resistance decreases, the variable resistance of the regulator decreases.

</p><p class="paragraph">SHUNT REGULATORS use a variable resistance placed in parallel with the load. Regulation is 
achieved by keeping the resistance of the load constant. Characteristically, the resistance of the shunt 
</p><p class="paragraph">moves in the opposite direction of the resistance of the load. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">VR-TUBE REGULATORS are shunt regulators that use a cold cathode as a variable resistance in 
parallel with the load. Because of their ability to maintain a constant voltage potential between their plates 
</p><p class="paragraph">and cathode, glow tubes can be connected in series to regulate any voltage. Additionally, glow tubes can 
</p><p class="paragraph">be used to deliver different voltages to different loads. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">SIMPLE ELECTRON TUBE REGULATORS use the dc plate resistance of a triode as a variable 
resistance in series with the load. The resistance of the vacuum tube is varied by changing the amount of 
</p><p class="paragraph">conduction of the tube. This is done by holding the control grid voltage at a constant level and allowing 
</p><p class="paragraph">the cathode voltage to vary with the output voltage. 
</p><p class="paragraph"> 
</p><p class="paragraph">The AMPERITE VOLTAGE REGULATOR or BALLAST TUBE is normally used to control 
current surges. This is done by heating an iron wire in a hydrogen-filled envelope. The hot iron will
